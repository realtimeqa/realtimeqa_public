Isar Aerospace, which had warned that the initial launch could end prematurely, said the test produced extensive data that its team can learn from.\n\nBlasting off from Norway's Arctic Andoeya Spaceport, the Spectrum is designed for small and medium-sized satellites weighing up to one metric ton, though it did not carry a payload on its maiden voyage.\n\nGlobal players in the satellite launch market include Elon Musk's SpaceX, which launches from the United States, and French ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran that uses a spaceport in South America's French Guiana.\n\nSpaceX also operates the Starlink satellite service, a communications network spanning much of the globe.\n\nGermany's BDLI aerospace industries association said Isar's first flight would lead to further progress.\n\n\"Europe urgently needs to ensure its sovereignty in space.

Intelligence analyst Brijesh Khemlani argued a decade ago that “growing interest and involvement of India, China and the US” in Asia “may well end the relatively benign security landscape that Southeast Asia has enjoyed for the last two decades”.\n\nIn an article for the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, he argued that “the backdrop of an increasingly assertive China and lingering political and territorial disputes” meant the region’s “security environment is witnessing a silent change”.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) arms transfers database, weaponry deliveries to Southeast Asia nearly doubled between 2005 and 2009 compared with the five preceding years. Deliveries to Malaysia jumped by the highest rate, at 722%, while those to Singapore increased by 146%, and to Indonesia by 84%.\n\nThe SIPRI found that China’s military spending totalled $252bn (£182bn) in 2020, an increase of 1.9% over 2019 at at time when many other nations cut military spending due to the Covid pandemic. The hike marked a rise of 76% over the past decade.\n\nJapan ($49.1bn/£35bn), South Korea ($45.7/£34.4bn) and Australia ($27.5bn/£19.9bn) were the other big military spenders in the region last year. All four countries boosted their spending between 2019 and 2020 and have steadily increased their military budgets over the past decade.\n\nHaving “once stayed on the sidelines”, nations across the region are now “following in the footsteps of powerhouses China and the United States” by “building arsenals of advanced long-range missiles”, said Reuters.\n\nBefore this decade is over, the news agency added, Asia will be “bristling with conventional missiles that fly farther and faster, hit harder, and are more sophisticated than ever before” prompting “a stark and dangerous change from recent years”.\n\n“The missile landscape is changing in Asia, and it’s changing fast,” warned David Santoro, president of the Pacific Forum. “Missile proliferation will fuel suspicions, trigger arms races, increase tensions, and ultimately cause crises and even wars.”\n\nThe potentially deadly “combination of economic wealth and political tension” in Asia “means that countries all over the world see an interest in maintaining stability in the region and showing a military presence there”, said The Times’s Lloyd-Parry.\n\nNoting that the UK’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, will travel through Asia on its maiden voyage, he warned that the arrival of foreign powers - set to the backdrop of increasing Asian military might - has set the countries of the region further “on edge”.\n\nDanger in the Pacific\n\nAsian nations have “generally managed to avoid direct combat with one another since the Vietnam War”, said Michael T. Klare, professor of peace and world security studies at the Massachusetts-based Five Colleges consortium. The conflict between China and Vietnam in 1979 is “the sole exception”, he noted.\n\nHowever, he continued in an article for Foreign Affairs, there are signs “tension in Korea and a number of territorial disputes in the South China Sea area could provide the sparks to ignite a regional conflagration”.\n\nAnd “the acceleration of regional arms races is made more worrisome by the absence of any regional arms control talks, such as those now under way in the Middle East”.\n\nOne goal behind Joe Biden’s decision to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan was to realign foreign policy towards the region, a move described in Washington as a “pivot to Asia”.\n\nThe US is seeking to “base medium-range missiles within striking range of China and North Korea” in the Asia-Pacific, Al Jazeera said, as “accurate, non-nuclear missiles based close by its adversaries would tip the strategic balance further back in its favour”.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia and Japan - two key US allies - have also “announced their intentions to boost defence spending and adopt a more aggressive military posture”, the broadcaster added - a move attacked by critics as “an offensive military stance” that will only “encourage China to boost its own offensive capabilities”.\n\n“North Korea’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is a dramatic and obvious cause of alarm to its neighbours,” said Lloyd-Parry.\n\nBut the North is by no means the only Asian player to do so, and “with so much uncertainty, and so much new military force and equipment” across the region, “the potential for miscalculation is always present”.\n\nThe Economist has previously described Taiwan as “the most dangerous place on Earth”, owing to its position as a pinch point between two of the world’s military superpowers.\n\nBut as Reuters noted, more and more of the Asia Pacific is becoming “caught between China and the US” - suggesting that the “most dangerous” tag may soon extend to the entire region.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Justin Klawans", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Elizabeth Carr-Ellis"], "publish_date": "2021/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/956580/the-battle-over-the-donbas-explained", "title": "The battle over the Donbas: why is the region so key to this war ...", "text": "Donbas is an abbreviation of the words “Donets Basin”: the region, bordering Russia and named after the Donets River, contains one of the world’s largest coal basins. Until the 18th century, it was a region of steppe grassland inhabited by Cossack and Tatar nomads and known in Ukrainian as Dyke Pole, “the wild fields”. But its character changed profoundly after coal was discovered: it became one of Russia’s major industrial regions.\n\nToday, the Donbas is shorthand for two Ukrainian oblasts (provinces), Donetsk and Luhansk, based on two cities which were both founded by British industrialists. Charles Gascoigne, an Englishman, built an iron works in what is now Luhansk in 1795; and Welshman John Hughes started a steel plant and coal mine in Donetsk in 1869. The latter city was named after him (“Hughesovka” or “Yuzovka”) until the Soviet era.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Donbas and the Black Sea coast were taken over from the Tatars and the Turks by the Russian empire, and became known as Novorossiya (New Russia). European colonists – Russians, Ukrainians, Romanians, Serbs, Greeks – were encouraged to settle there. But after the Industrial Revolution took hold in the late 19th century, the Donbas was largely settled by Russian workers. By 1913, it produced nearly 90% of Russian coal.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

After Second World War, about two million Russians moved to the Donbas to work in its factories.\n\nWhat are the region’s demographics?\n\nIn Soviet and post-Soviet times, the cities were largely Russian ethnically and linguistically, while the villages remained Ukrainian. Ukraine’s 2001 census (its most recent) found that ethnic Ukrainians form 58% of the population of Luhansk Oblast and 56.9% of Donetsk Oblast; ethnic Russians formed 39% and 38.2% respectively. This made it Ukraine’s most ethnically Russian region except for Crimea.\n\nIn Donetsk, Russian was the main language of 74.9% of residents; in Luhansk, that figure was 68.8%. Voting patterns in the region have long suggested stronger support for closer links to Russia than elsewhere in Ukraine: in the elections of 2004 and 2010, the pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych (a Donetsk native) performed strongly in Donbas; he was elected president from 2010 until the Euromaidan crisis in 2014.\n\nWhat happened in 2014?\n\nIn February, President Yanukovych fled Kyiv after months of street protests in the “Maidan Revolution”, precipitated by his rejection of Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU. In most of Ukraine and in the West, this was seen as a pro-European democratic uprising.\n\nIn Donbas, and other ethnically Russian areas, it was regarded by many as a Ukrainian nationalist movement (with fascist elements), which threatened their identity: in 2014, for instance, laws which protected the use of the Russian language in schools and government institutions were scrapped.\n\nRussia responded to the crisis by annexing Crimea in March that year; a month later, hostilities erupted in Ukraine’s east, where Russian-backed militias seized government buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk. In May, the groups declared independence as the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (known as the DNR and LNR, respectively), reviving the term Novorossiya to identify the Donbas.\n\nHow did the conflict play out?\n\nInitially, Russia fought a “hybrid” war, using local fighters backed by Russian special forces and mercenaries, and by extensive military support. But when Ukrainian forces went on the offensive, threatening to take back nearly all the separatist-held territories – including the prized port city of Mariupol – Russia launched a conventional invasion in response.\n\nIn February 2015, a ceasefire brokered by France and Germany – known as Minsk II – froze the conflict, leaving about a third of Luhansk and Donetsk under separatist control. A 500km “line of contact”, bristling with trenches and landmines, cut the region in two. More than 14,000 people were killed in Donbas from 2014-2021. The UN said in 2018 that 1.6 million people had been displaced in the region, which had a pre-war population of 6.5 million.\n\nIs the separatist cause justified?\n\nNo. Donbas certainly has a political culture distinct from much of Ukraine; the language issue has caused resentment, and some rightwing Ukrainian nationalist parties are explicitly Russophobic. But before 2014, there was no evidence of widespread mistreatment of Russian Ukrainians, and pro-Russian separatism was a minority position among them.\n\nIn Ukraine’s 1991 independence referendum, 84% of people in Donetsk and Luhansk voted for independence from the USSR. However, the Kremlin has weaponised ethnic grievances, using them as an excuse to instal brutal puppet governments, which owe their power to Moscow.\n\nWhat is life like inside the breakaway republics?\n\nIn their eight-years of existence, the republics of DNR and LNR have evolved into “North Korea-like statelets”, says Mansur Mirovalev on Al Jazeera. Both have restored the Soviet constitutions adopted by Stalin; in Donetsk, a 13.5m statue of Lenin dominates the main square. The death penalty is prescribed for various crimes, an anomaly in modern-day Europe.\n\nConversations, phone calls and text messages are monitored by secret police; arbitrary arrests are common, and many reports suggest interrogators have used torture to extract confessions. There is no press freedom; electoral fraud is widespread; corruption is rife.\n\nBoth republics are “entirely dependent on Moscow for financial and military support”, a report by the Freedom House NGO said this year. Crossings into Ukrainian-controlled territory are tightly restricted, and schools, universities, public services and businesses are dominated by people loyal to the separatist leadership.\n\nAs part of the statelets’ “Russification” campaigns, official-language status for Ukrainian has been abolished, and schools have stopped teaching Ukrainian language and history. Since 2019, the Russian government has distributed more than 600,000 Russian passports to residents.\n\nWhy is the region so important to Putin?\n\nThe “liberation” of those living under “neo-Nazi” rule in Donbas is Putin’s casus belli, and before launching the invasion in February he recognised the separatist republics. It is generally thought that, if he manages to conquer the Donbas, he will annex it, as he did with Crimea in 2014. He wants it for its own sake, and also as a “land bridge” from Russia to Crimea, and possibly other Russianspeaking cities such as Kherson, and even Odesa in the southwest.\n\nHowever, even Ukraine’s pro-Russian parties came out against the invasion, and the savaging of Russian-speaking cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv has powerfully alienated RussianUkrainians from Putin’s war aims.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/957513/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-31-july-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 31 July 2022 | The Week", "text": "1. Charles accepted £1m from Bin Ladens\n\nPrince Charles accepted a £1m payment from the family of Osama bin Laden, reported The Sunday Times. The Prince of Wales secured the money from Bakr bin Laden, the patriarch of the Saudi family, and his brother Shafiq - half-brothers of the founder of al-Qaeda who masterminded the September 11 attacks. Charles reportedly accepted the money despite objections of advisers, with one household staff member “shouted down”. A Clarence House spokeswoman said: “The Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund has assured us that thorough due diligence was undertaken in accepting this donation.”\n\n2. Brits ‘may have to queue for water’\n\nInfrastructure advisers have told the government that a national hosepipe ban should be implemented as a priority along with compulsory water metering across the UK by the end of the decade. The National Infrastructure Committee said failure to act now would leave Britain facing a future of queues for emergency bottled water “from the back of lorries”. Meanwhile, said The Telegraph, households could face fines and jail time for clogging up sewers, as Thames Water cracks down on customers pouring oil down the sink.\n\n3. Voters want snap election\n\nA majority of voters believe a general election should be called immediately after the Tory leadership election, a survey for The Independent reveals. The poll found that 56% support the proposal that whoever wins the leadership contest “should call a general election immediately”. Around 160,000 members of the Conservative Party – equivalent to 0.34% of the voting public – will begin casting their ballots next week to elect the next Tory leader and Britain’s next prime minister.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Lionesses on brink of history\n\nEngland’s Lionesses could make history when they take on Germany in the European Championship final at Wembley this afternoon. A win would be both the first major trophy for the England women’s team and the first football honour for the nation since the men’s 1966 World Cup. Sky News said the English are “underdogs” because Germany have won the title eight times, as well as 21 of the 27 meetings between the two sides. However, England coach Sarina Wiegman said: “We don’t fear anyone.”\n\n5. China rocket debris crashes to Earth\n\nDebris from a Chinese rocket has crashed to Earth over the Indian and Pacific oceans, said officials from Washington and Beijing. China’s space agency said most remains of the Long March 5 burnt in the atmosphere, identifying the Sulu Sea in the Pacific as the re-entry location. The uncontrolled return of rocket’s core stage has raised questions about responsibility for space junk. “All spacefaring nations should follow established best practices,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson.\n\n6. Zelenskyy calls for Donetsk evacuation\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a mandatory evacuation of people in the Donetsk region, amid fierce fighting with Russia. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president said hundreds of thousands of people still in combat zones in the larger Donbas region also needed to leave. “The more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill,” the Ukrainian leader said. “We will use all available opportunities to save as many lives as possible and to limit Russian terror as much as possible.”\n\n7. Sunak and Truss make new pledges\n\nRishi Sunak has announced that he would introduce a £10 fine for missed GP and hospital appointments as part of a “transformative” shake-up of the NHS. The Tory hopeful told The Telegraph it was “not right” that patients were failing to turn up for consultations, scans and check-ups, “taking those slots away from people who need [them]”. Meanwhile, Liz Truss has vowed that there would be no second referendum on Scottish independence under her reign, as she vowed to strengthen and defend the Union.\n\n8. Arrest after murder shocks Italy\n\nAn Italian man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a Nigerian street seller, whose beating in broad daylight has caused national outrage. Alika Ogorchukwu, 39, was killed in the centre of Civitanova Marche on Friday afternoon. Footage of the attack - which has been widely circulated on Italian news websites and social media - has caused shock. A 32-year-old man, from Salerno in the Campania region, has been arrested on charges of murder and allegedly stealing Ogorchukwu’s mobile phone.\n\n9. Biden positive again after ‘rebound’\n\nJoe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19 again, in what has been described as a “rebound” infection by his doctor. The US president contracted the virus on 21 July, when he was revealed to be experiencing mild symptoms, but he tested negative for the virus four times between Tuesday and Friday last week. Following the new positive test, the 79-year-old said he was not experiencing symptoms but would isolate “for the safety of everyone around me”. A White House official said contact tracing efforts were underway.\n\n10. ‘Jaw-dropping’ Andrew pic would ‘embarrass royals’\n\nPrince Andrew was photographed “laughing his head off” while denying allegations of raping an underage girl during the notorious Newsnight interview because he “thought it had gone very well,” reported The Sun. A source said the unreleased image of the Duke of York’s Buckingham Palace interview, snapped by a BBC photographer, would further “embarrass” the royal family if became public.

But it was William Willett who successfully championed the idea.\n\nWillett, a prosperous builder, had a eureka moment while out riding in Kent early on a summer’s morning. In 1907, he published a pamphlet, The Waste of Daylight, which noted that in summer “the Sun shines upon the land for several hours each day while we are asleep”, and yet there “remains only a brief spell of declining daylight” after work, in which to pursue leisure activities (a keen golfer, he disliked cutting short his round at dusk).\n\nRather impractically, he proposed moving the clocks forward by 80 minutes, in 20-minute weekly steps, on Sundays in April, and doing the reverse in September. He campaigned vigorously; but Parliament rejected the idea in 1909, and Willett was to die of flu in 1915 before his plan was adopted.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWhen was his proposal adopted?\n\nGermany was the first country to do so – deciding, in April 1916, to put the clocks forward in order to save electricity used for lighting and thus boost production during the First World War; Britain followed suit a few weeks later, using Greenwich Mean Time in the winter but moving to GMT+1, or British Summer Time (BST), during the summer months. The US followed in March 1918.\n\nIn Britain, the move initially caused confusion and opposition, though the nation has mostly stuck to the same system since 1916. In America, the confusion was longer-lasting. Daylight saving was cancelled after the War because of pressure from the farm lobby, but some states kept it, resulting in a patchwork of multiple different time zones – until in 1966, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, promoting six months of standard and six of daylight saving. Today, daylight saving is used in about 70 countries, affecting more than one billion people.\n\nAnd what benefits does it bring?\n\nIt certainly helps us to enjoy long summer evenings. Beyond that, says Michael Downing, author of a book on the subject, “opponents and supporters of daylight saving are still not sure exactly what it does”.\n\nStudies suggest it increases physical activity – TV ratings for the evenings drop when the clocks go forward in spring. It certainly reduces electricity used on lighting – though in the US it has been suggested that these savings are offset by extra energy consumed in leisure activities. It seems to reduce traffic accidents, which rise after dark, and is popular with business, because longer evenings encourage people to shop.\n\nWhat are the downsides?\n\nThe actual changing of the clocks is inconvenient and unpopular, and has tangibly negative effects. Scientists in Denmark who studied 185,419 people diagnosed with depression found that the condition soared by 11% when the clocks went back in autumn, caused by the disruption of body clocks and the suddenly shortened evenings.\n\nOther studies have found that the risk of heart attacks, strokes and traffic accidents grows immediately after the clocks go forward in the spring, and judges are more likely to dole out harsh sentences then, presumably owing to the loss of an hour of sleep. A 2019 YouGov poll found that people in the UK were moderately in favour of keeping BST, by 44% to 39%. But a clear majority of Britons (59%) would like to remain permanently on summer time.\n\nSo why don’t we do that?\n\nBritain tried it between October 1968 and October 1971. Harold Wilson’s government adopted GMT+1 all year round, or British Standard Time, as an experiment. The Home Office reported that it caused a substantial drop in road fatalities in the evening and a slight increase in the morning, as well as considerable savings in electricity and an increase in outdoor sports.\n\nOfficial polls found that it was supported by 50% of the population and opposed by 41%, but it was unpopular in Scotland, where in midwinter the Sun didn’t rise until as late as 10am, meaning that children walked to school in the dark.\n\nBusiness and tourism were in favour of British Standard Time; farmers, the construction industry and other outdoor workers with early starts, such as postmen, objected to having to work for hours in the dark. On a free vote in 1970, the House of Commons voted by 366 to 81 in favour of returning to the old system.\n\nWhat positions have other nations taken?\n\nMost nations that aren’t near the equator observe daylight saving in some form. The major exceptions are India, Russia and China. But whatever position a nation takes, it seems to remain controversial in some quarters. Russia instituted permanent daylight saving in 2011, then rejected it altogether in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, the European Parliament voted to do away with daylight saving, though the proposal has yet to be approved by the European Council. In the US, by contrast, a bipartisan group of senators unanimously voted through the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021, which would make year-round daylight saving time the law of the land; neither President Biden nor the House of Representatives has yet approved the measure.\n\nIs any change likely in the UK?\n\nIn 2010, a Private Member’s Bill was proposed calling for year-round daylight saving. Alex Salmond called it an attempt to “plunge Scotland into morning darkness”. It was filibustered out of Parliament; Jacob Rees-Mogg added a wrecking amendment giving Somerset its own time zone.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is still campaigning for year-round BST, which it estimates would reduce road deaths by 70 per year and would have a host of other benefits, including a reduction in crime, which increases in the hours of darkness.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "Theara Coleman", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/962326/the-anthropocene-epoch", "title": "The Anthropocene epoch: end of an era? | The Week", "text": "In the early 19th century, scientists started using rock strata to divide the Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history into distinct periods. By that point, they were beginning to realise that Earth was far, far older than previously thought, and were naming and organising different rock formations in an attempt to impose order on its lifespan. This gave rise to the “geologic time scale”, a dating system based on rock and fossil formations. From largest to smallest, these chapters are called eons, eras, periods, epochs and ages.\n\nFor the past 11,700 years, we’ve been living through the Holocene epoch, which began at the end of the last ice age. It is a subdivision of the Quaternary period, which is itself a subdivision of the Cenozoic era, and of the Phanerozoic eon. But now there’s a growing consensus that we have entered the Earth’s latest epoch: the Anthropocene.\n\nWhen was that term first coined?\n\nIt was invented in the 1980s, but first gained publicity in February 2000, when it was used by the Nobel Prize-winning Dutch chemist Paul Crutzen at a meeting of scientists in Mexico. Derived from Greek, it means “the recent age of man”, and describes an era in which human beings have become the driving force of changes to our planet. Crutzen’s argument was that humanity has so profoundly shaped the planet that it has created a new epoch in what is, in geological terms, the blink of an eye.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Yet our geological footprint is large: the fossil record will show a vast accumulation of plastics and concrete, and an explosion of manipulated life forms, such as domesticated chickens, wheat and corn. We have changed the planet’s landscapes and waters; fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilisers have profoundly altered the chemistry of the air and the oceans.\n\nJust 4% of the world’s mammals today are wild; all other animals have been modified to feed or serve us. According to the UN, 38% of the planet’s land surface has been converted to agriculture to feed humans; about 3% is given over to urban areas. A sixth mass extinction of wildlife in Earth’s history is widely acknowledged to be under way; sea ice is retreating; extreme weather and wildfires are regular occurrences.\n\nIs there consensus on the issue?\n\nFew mainstream scientists deny that humans are impacting the planet in myriad ways; but not all are convinced that the Earth has passed from one epoch to another. Many feel that the changes we’ve experienced in the past century are a mere “blip” compared with the truly apocalyptic events of the deep past – such as the “Great Dying” that marks the boundary between the Permian and Triassic Periods about 252 million years ago, when temperatures rose about 10ºC and 96% of marine species died.\n\nGeologists build their timescales using rocks, which are formed over thousands of years. The rocks of the Anthropocene, one geologist told The Guardian, represent merely “two centimetres of unconsolidated organic matter”. From that perspective, it’s a mere instant. And even if it is accepted as a valid division, there is disagreement about where it would start.\n\nWhen is it said to have started?\n\nSome scientists, such as Paul Crutzen, argue that it should be dated to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when atmospheric concentrations of CO2 began to rise significantly.\n\nOthers, however, prefer the idea of dating it to the start of the so-called “great acceleration”, the surge in human activity and in human population that began in the middle of the last century. This would allow a convenient marker to be used: the first human-generated radioactive particles – following the detonation of the first atomic bombs in New Mexico and Japan in 1945, and subsequent tests – appear clearly in the geological record. This is known as the “bomb spike”.\n\nWho actually decides these things?\n\nThe International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS); or, to be more specific, its International Commission on Stratigraphy – stratigraphy being the branch of geology concerned with rock layers. This, in turn, set up a 37-member Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) in 2009, with the aim of providing evidence robust enough for the Anthropocene to be formally ratified by the IUGS as an epoch (or perhaps an age) within the geologic timescale.\n\nThe group has chosen Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada, as a reference point for its work. It’s small but deep; matter that sinks 24 metres or so to the bottom is well preserved, and thus the sediment represents an “exquisite record” of recent millennia.\n\nWhen will this be decided?\n\nIf the AWG succeeds in its bid, the IUGS could officially declare the Anthropocene after a final vote at the International Geological Congress in Busan, South Korea, in August next year. That in itself would be a momentous event, a clear indication of the enormous transformation that humans have inflicted on the planet, and a spur to political action to limit that impact.\n\nHumanity has thrived in the Holocene epoch, a benign period in which temperatures were relatively stable, the ice caps retreated, and the atmosphere was generally hospitable. Epochal shifts, by contrast, often spell cataclysm. The end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago, thought to have been caused by a massive asteroid, resulted in another great extinction, of three-quarters of the animal and plant species on Earth.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/09"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/society/954158/the-women-of-greenham-common", "title": "The women of Greenham Common and their legacy 40 years on ...", "text": "In 1981, four friends from west Wales – Ann Pettitt, Karmen Cutler, Lynne Whittemore and Liney Seward – decided to walk 120 miles to RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire to protest at the storing of US nuclear cruise missiles on British soil.\n\nOn 27 August, 36 women, four men and a handful of children left Cardiff. Ten days later, the marchers reached the base and delivered an open letter to the commander, stating: “We are implacably opposed to the siting of US cruise missiles in this country.” To reinforce the point, 36 of the marchers chained themselves to the base fence, in a deliberate echo of the suffragettes.\n\nWhy were US missiles in Berkshire?\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

This alarmed military planners in Britain and Western Europe.\n\nNato responded by negotiating for restrictions on such weapons while expanding its own arsenal. In 1979, it decided to deploy US medium-range Pershing II missiles in West Germany, and Tomahawk cruise missiles across Europe. From 1983, 96 of the latter were to be based at Greenham, about four miles from Newbury, where a base built on common land during WWII had been lent to the US air force.\n\nIn this period, Cold War tensions, and widespread disquiet about the presence of nuclear weapons in Britain, reached their highest levels since the 1960s.\n\nWhy did the Greenham protest continue?\n\nOne of the women who chained herself to the fence, Helen John, was so infuriated by the dismissive response of the US commander, who told her she could stay there as long as she liked, that she decided to “take him up on that generous offer”.\n\nGenerally, though, the protesters realised that the march alone wasn’t going to provoke a national debate about the missiles. Maintaining a presence became the point. With winter approaching, their improvised bivouacs near the base’s main gate evolved into a permanent “Peace Camp”, which put itself on a women-only footing in February 1982 (men were allowed in during the daytime).\n\nIn time, different camps with different cultures sprang up at each of the base’s nine gates. The original camp was “Yellow Gate”. “Green Gate”, the furthest from the road, was considered the most child-friendly. Others had religious, artistic or New Age emphases.\n\nWhy women-only?\n\nThe original march was conceived as a women’s enterprise, but didn’t exclude men. The decision to have no men was partly practical: they were thought more likely to be violent during protests. It was also partly symbolic: the protesters presented themselves as mothers or grandmothers, protesting in the name of their children and future generations.\n\nThe leaderless movement that emerged understood the power of imagery. Some Greenham women styled themselves after witches; they sang and performed “mass ululation”. In 1983, some invaded the base while dressed as teddy bears. Photos of women blocking the gates or being manhandled by police officers filled the newspapers.\n\nThe idea of the Peace Camp as a radical space for women acquired its own momentum. “Many of us came for the nuclear weapons and stayed for the feminism,” one participant later said.\n\nDid they spark a debate?\n\nYes. By the time the first missiles reached Greenham, in November 1983, the camp was internationally famous. Alerted by pre-digital networking methods, such as chain letters and “telephone trees”, 30,000 women turned up in December 1982 for an event called “Embrace the Base”, during which they formed a human chain along all nine miles of the perimeter.\n\nOn New Year’s Day in 1983, protesters scaled the fence and danced on the missile silos. In April of the same year, CND staged a 14-mile human chain from Greenham to a weapons factory in Burghfield. Julie Christie, Yoko Ono and Takako Doi, the future leader of the Japanese Social Democrats, visited the site.\n\nThe missile deployment – nodded through by James Callaghan’s Labour government in the 1970s, and strongly supported by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives – was feverishly discussed in the national media.\n\nHow did the authorities react?\n\nThe civil and military authorities struggled to find a balance between respecting the right to protest and keeping the base running, especially after the missiles had been delivered. Newbury District Council regularly sent in bailiffs and bulldozers. There were mass arrests under hastily enacted by-laws, which were found to be illegal by the House of Lords in 1990.\n\nThe camps came under attack from right-wing vigilantes, some of them organised into groups such as RAGE (Ratepayers Against the Greenham Encampments), and the conservative press portrayed the women as crazed, unwashed lesbian separatists.\n\nMichael Heseltine, then defence secretary, told Parliament in 1983 that intruders ran the risk of being shot. None were. One protester, Helen Thomas, was killed by a police van in 1989, aged 22. Her death was ruled an accident at the inquest.\n\nHow did the protest end?\n\nThe breakthrough came with the Reykjavik nuclear summit of 1986; as a result, the US air force began to remove the missiles in 1989, completing the job two years later. The base was handed back to the RAF in September 1992, and then closed. In 1997, the Common was redesignated as public parkland; it became common land again.\n\nThe last protesters left their camp in September 2000, 19 years after they had arrived. Some had been there for the duration. A business park now covers some of the former airbase. The Cold War-era control tower is a visitor centre. A “Peace Garden” marks the site of Yellow Gate.\n\nCampaigners on the site of Greenham Common in 2000 (Image credit: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe legacy of Greenham\n\nUS cruise missiles were removed from Greenham as a result of the Reykjavik Summit, held in 1986 between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, who had become General Secretary of the USSR a year earlier. Gorbachev unexpectedly agreed to a US “zero option” proposal to eliminate all intermediate-range missiles. The result was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty of 1987; Soviet weapons inspectors were admitted to Greenham in 1988.\n\nThere are some who argue that Margaret Thatcher, who helped broker the summit, actually did more to lift the nuclear threat than the peace protesters did. However, Gorbachev later specifically said that the Greenham women influenced his decision to go to Reykjavik, and one of Reagan’s advisers later said that the “zero option” had been copied “straight off the women’s banners”.\n\nTheir battle against nuclear weapons continues: the Government is going ahead with Trident renewal, and the US, under Donald Trump, withdrew from the INF treaty. However, the peace camp also served as a kind of university for large numbers of politically-minded women who lived there or visited. “The women of Greenham Common taught a generation how to protest,” said the film-maker Beeban Kidron.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/952409/the-history-of-the-union-jack", "title": "The history of the Union Jack | The Week", "text": "Government ministers looking to bolster the embattled state of the union are pinning their hopes on a potent symbol.\n\nIn “another apparent escalation of the ongoing flag-based culture war,” newly issued guidance from the Department of Culture advises that the Union Jack should be flown every day from all government buildings in England, Wales and Scotland, The Guardian reports.\n\nCulture Secretary Oliver Dowden has called Union Jack “a proud reminder of our history and the ties that bind us” - but not everyone agrees.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

According to the Royal Family’s website, “this is because when the Union flag was created in 1606, the Principality of Wales by that time was already united with England and was no longer a separate principality”.\n\nThe Union Jack is now raised on about 20 designated days a year, “covering national saints’ days across the UK nations and a selection of royal occasions, primarily the birthdays of senior family members”, says The Guardian.\n\nUnion Jack or Union Flag?\n\nMany people believe that the national flag should be called the “Jack” only when flown from a British warship, but the Flag Institute says that “either name is valid”.\n\n“In 1902, an Admiralty Circular announced that either name could be used officially,” the educational charity explains. “And in 1908, the UK Parliament approved this verdict, stating that ‘the Union Jack should be regarded as the national flag’.”\n\nThe origins of the term “Union Jack” is unclear, but Buckingham Palace historians believe it may date from the time of Queen Anne’s reign (1702-14).\n\n“It may come from the ‘jack-et’ of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603,” says the Royal Family’s website.\n\nRaising ministers’ flagging hopes\n\nMembers of the current government have shown an “increasing fondness” for ensuring that a Union Jack “is part of their home or office backdrop for TV interviews”, says The Guardian. But the trend triggered a row recently when BBC Breakfast presenters Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty “were chastised for gently teased” Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick over his display of the flag.\n\nThe decision to fly the Union Jack continuously from government buildings appears to be part of “ongoing government efforts to associate itself with a more overt union-based nationalism”, the paper continues. Councils will also be “urged to do the same from their premises”, and the only exceptions to the rule will be “times when a single flagpole is otherwise occupied, whether by another UK flag or flags to mark particular events”.\n\nThe new guidance has met with a mixed response from commentators.\n\nThe flag “has always been part of the British national consciousness”, writes Sean O’Grady in The Independent, and is “sometimes associated with freedom and democracy, and the defeat of fascism”. However, “at other times, the flag accompanied imperial conquest and oppression”, he notes.\n\nThe Telegraph’s Patrick O’Flynn says that distaste for the Union Jack is an “explicitly political rejection of Britain’s history and heritage”, and exemplifies a “belief that this country should be ashamed of both”. But “these symbols of belonging carry a powerful message about mutual obligation and the ties that bind us together in one society”, he argues.\n\nThe Times also views the Union Jack as a useful tool for promoting national harmony. “Given that the words English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish carry, for good or ill, a connotation of ethnicity which perhaps excludes non-natives, allegiance to Britain serves as a useful unifying alternative,” says the paper.\n\nMaybe in theory, says The Guardian’s John Harris, but the flag’s meaning has become “tattered and torn”. Ministers may try to convince us otherwise with their displays of “national chest-beating”, but “mass backing in Scotland for independence”, and increasing support in Wales to go it alone, “clearly speaks for itself”, he continues.\n\nAnd “in both countries, Union Jacks and invocations of the bulldog spirit will surely do the fragile cause of unionism much more harm than good”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Fred Kelly", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/03/31"}]}

She is almost certain to appeal, and neither of those penalties would be applied until her appeals are exhausted.\n\nBut her five-year ineligibility sentence kicks in immediately, via a so-called \"provisional execution\" measure requested by prosecutors, and will only be lifted if any appeal is upheld before the election. She retains her parliamentary seat until her mandate ends.\n\nArnaud Benedetti, a political analyst who has written a book on the RN, said Le Pen's five-year ban was a watershed moment in French politics that would reverberate across parties and through the electorate.\n\n\"This is a seismic political event,\" he said. \"Inevitably, it's going to reshuffle the pack, particularly on the right.\"\n\nAppeals in France can take months or even years.\n\nRN President Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 29-year-old right-hand man, now looks set to become the party's de facto candidate for the 2027 election.\n\nWhile he has helped expand the RN's appeal among younger voters, experts say it's unclear whether he has the experience to win over the broader electorate the RN needs to secure victory in 2027.\n\n\"I am not sure that Jordan Bardella's political proposition is mature enough to be able to compete credibly in the presidential election,\" Benedetti said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/04/23/french-presidential-candidates-emmanuel-macron-marine-le-pen/100819860/", "title": "Le Pen and Macron: Candidates vying to be France's next president", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFrance moved one step closer Sunday to electing a new president after a far-right nationalist and a youthful former banker appeared to beat out nine other candidates to make it into the second round of the country's presidential election.

Here’s a closer look at their views:\n\nMarine Le Pen\n\nLe Pen took control of the far-right National Front Party from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 and epitomizes Europe's anti-European and anti-immigration attitude.\n\nDefeat in the runoff would represent the third major blow to populist parties in Europe in recent months following election rejections in the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nLe Pen is a lawyer who has worked to soften the party's image following her father's strident rhetoric.\n\nThe telegenic, twice-divorced mother of three children lives in the Paris suburbs.\n\nHer calls to forcibly expel illegal immigrants, close mosques linked to extremists and pull France out of the EU resonate with many middle class and rural voters.\n\nLe Pen wants to ban all visible religious symbols worn in public, including Muslim headscarves and Jewish Kippahs. She believes globalization and international organizations such as NATO and the International Monetary Fund have undermined the nation-state.\n\nShe wants to introduce a new tax on foreign workers so that French nationals would have an advantage in the labor market.\n\nLe Pen has been dogged for months by an anti-corruption probe into allegations that she improperly used EU funds to pay her personal assistant and bodyguard for jobs in France. She has denied breaking any rules and refused to submit to questioning until after the election.\n\nLe Pen helped her party achieve its previous best-ever showing in a presidential election when the National Front came in third in the first round of 2012's vote.\n\nShe hailed her advancement to the runoff for her party as historic and vowed to be a \"great alternative\" for the French people.\n\n\"There are two things I want to give back to you, the people. Your voice... and your money!” she has said on the campaign trail.\n\nEmmanuel Macron\n\nMacron has never held elected office and is married to a former teacher 20 years his senior.\n\nIf elected, a scenario surveys show is highly likely, he would be France's youngest president.\n\nThe former investment banker was France's economy minister, but quit incumbent President François Hollande's Socialist government to run for office as an independent.\n\nThe business-friendly challenger has emerged from relative obscurity to adopt a centrist position viewed as a liberal alternative to Le Pen, and his newly-formed En Marche! party is a big departure from France's traditional left or right political leadership.\n\n\"A Macron victory would break the political mould of the Fifth Republic.

The \"Macron Law\" is a bill he introduced as economy minister that allowed more stores to open on Sundays.\n\nHis victory would represent a repudiation of a continent-wide backlash against Muslim immigration and European unity.\n\n\"The surge of support for Emmanuel Macron in France shows that liberal, pro-EU centrists may yet have a future in European politics. This would be good for the EU,\" Grant said.\n\nFrance's political establishment have rushed to endorse Macron in the wake of the result. Failed Conservative candidate Francois Fillon said he would vote for Macron because Le Pen would \"bankrupt France.\"\n\nIn a last-minute intervention, former President Obama publicly endorsed Macron, saying in a video that he is \"not planning to get involved in many elections now that I don’t have to run for office but the French election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care so much about.\"\n\nObama said he was supporting Macron because he appealed to \"people’s hopes and not their fears.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/03/24/france-president-election-politicians-religion-muslims/99580576/", "title": "French politicians avoided religion — until this presidential campaign", "text": "Tom Heneghan\n\nReligion News Service\n\nPARIS (RNS) — Two of the most interesting photo ops of France’s current presidential election campaign took place last month 2,000 miles away in Lebanon — and they were all about religious optics.\n\nIn one, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen called off a scheduled meeting with Grand Mufti Abdellatif Deriane just outside his Beirut office when the Muslim cleric’s staff insisted she don a headscarf before going in for the meeting.\n\nWith the video cameras rolling, she emphatically refused.\n\nLater that day, with the same media entourage in tow, she smiled and exchanged pleasantries with Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, leader of Lebanon’s Maronite Christians and a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe National Front leader made her first trip abroad as presidential hopeful to burnish her weak foreign policy credentials, but the images flashed back to France sent a strong domestic message.\n\nHer supporters back home immediately got the memo — “no to Muslims, yes to Christians” — and loved it.\n\nPlaying the religion card so openly is unusual in France, where the official separation of church and state is normally taken so seriously that politicians rarely if ever mention in public whether they have a faith or not.\n\nBut this two-round election, on April 23 and May 7, is not taking place in normal times.\n\nAfter several deadly attacks by militant Islamists in recent years and sliding support for the main parties, politicians — especially from the right and far-right — are harking back to a secularized version of France’s traditional Catholic identity as one of several ways to mobilize voters.\n\nRead more:\n\nBurkini-clad woman forced to disrobe on French beach\n\nTop French court overturns controversial burkini ban\n\n5 things to know about French burkini bans\n\nTheir occasional religious references, which are mostly aimed at reassuring worried swing voters who could provide a crucial margin of victory, stand out in a country where many — notably on the left — denounce any suggestion of religion in politics as unacceptable populist manipulation.\n\n“Candidates know that religion as a shared culture speaks to many people in a world that no longer offers them a shining future,” Philippe Portier, sociologist of religion, told the newspaper 20 Minutes. “This talk can quickly resonate with a population that feels more and more culturally Christian, even while it doesn’t always follow the rules.”\n\nEleven candidates are competing in the election, and the top two from the first round will meet in the runoff two weeks later.\n\nOpinion polls have long put Le Pen out front in the first round with about 25% of the vote, but losing the runoff to whichever mainstream rival she faces. Centrist Emmanuel Macron, now polling about evenly with her, looks likely to be her opponent.\n\nWhen Le Pen took over the National Front from her father, Jean-Marie, in 2011, she set out to soften its reactionary image and woo mainstream voters by dropping its traditional anti-Semitism and stressing economic and social issues.\n\nA twice-divorced lawyer with three children and a sharp debater, she projected the image of a modern woman not afraid to take a stand.\n\nBut Francois Fillon showed in November that there were still lots of votes to win on the right when he swept the primary of the Republicans — the main conservative party — by openly appealing to traditional Catholics angered by the Socialist government’s legalization of same-sex marriage in 2013.\n\nHis unexpected primary victory made him look like the probable next president. But his campaign soon became mired in a series of financial scandals that unsettled Catholics originally attracted by his Mr. Clean image.\n\nLe Pen’s campaign shifted focus to go after those voters. In late February, she appeared at Mont Saint Michel, the famous medieval monastery off the Normandy coast, to deliver a stirring appeal to patriotic French voters to rally around her.\n\n“Mont Saint Michel, the eternal symbol of a France that draws strength and grandeur from its Christian roots,” the National Front’s secretary-general tweeted from her rally.\n\nIn interviews with Catholic publications, Le Pen explained she was Catholic but not practicing, like most French. “I am a believer,” she told the Christian news magazine La Vie. “But I only go to church for weddings, funerals and baptisms.”\n\nWhen asked how to square her opposition to immigration with the biblical teaching to welcome strangers, she insisted that those words pertained only to individual behavior and not political policies.\n\nReligion also figures in Le Pen’s campaign in a negative way through her insistence on a vigorous application of “laicite,” the official church-state separation that enjoys wide support in majority public opinion, especially on the left wing.\n\nOn closer inspection, her version of “laicite” turns out to be aimed against Muslims because it would rule out headscarves, halal meat, Islamic holidays and any other religious-based demands the minority might make.\n\nFillon, the candidate who brought religion into the campaign last autumn, engineered his surprising primary win by wooing traditional Catholics who took to the streets in 2012-2013 — many for the first time — to demonstrate against same-sex marriage.\n\nAfter gay marriage was legalized, many of them formed a network to keep their movement going.\n\nFillon tapped it for his campaign by openly calling himself Christian and expressing a personal opposition to abortion, even though he did nothing to limit it when he was prime minister from 2007 to 2012.\n\nBecause of his financial scandals, Fillon has since slipped to third place behind Le Pen and Macron with 18% in the opinion polls.\n\nBut he commands continued loyalty from a hard core of supporters, including campaign organization help from his traditional Catholic network, and still hopes to overtake Macron to run against Le Pen in the second round.\n\nPerhaps fitting for a centrist, Macron performs a balancing act on religion, upholding France’s policy of “laicite” but stressing it should not be pushed too far.\n\nDuring last summer’s debate about the “burkini,” the full-body swimsuit for Muslim women, he defended both some mayors at Mediterranean resorts who banned it and a woman’s freedom to decide what to wear.\n\nA child of an agnostic family, he revealed in December that he decided to be baptized a Catholic at 12 when he entered a Jesuit high school.\n\nDerided by his critics as “a new messiah” for the enthusiasm he generates among supporters, Macron doesn’t talk much about faith publicly. But he likes to say that “politics is mystical” and he finds “a transcendence in political activity.”\n\n“I think about the nature of my faith all the time, but I have enough humility that I don’t pretend to speak with God,” he told La Vie.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/956435/what-would-marine-le-pen-presidency-look-like", "title": "French election: what would a Marine Le Pen presidency look like ...", "text": "Marine Le Pen is hoping that it's third time lucky after sneaking through the first round of France’s presidential election.\n\nThe far-right National Rally leader came second in the first round, winning 23.1% of the vote.

In an effort to avoid “constitutional challenges” to her manifesto, she has said she will “use referendums on many of her proposed laws”.\n\nA longstanding Eurosceptic, Le Pen has pledged to “cut contributions to the EU”, the news site said, while arguing that “French law should prevail over EU rules”. This has allowed Macron to present the vote as a “referendum on Europe”, The Telegraph reported.\n\nAddressing a crowd in Strasbourg, the French seat of the European parliament, the incumbent on Tuesday said: “Europe is what protects us from crises and war.

But on the economic front, she has refashioned her previously “free-market, small-government party” into a “big-spending” and “protectionist” force.\n\nShe has advocated for a “Buy French” policy for public tenders, backed “scrapping income tax” for under-30s and promised to “cut VAT on energy to 5.5% from 20%”, the news agency said. Her party will also spend “two billion euros (£1.68bn) over five years raising hospital workers’ salaries”. Teachers’ pay would also be boosted.\n\nIn an effort to keep her traditional conservative voters onside with her big spending plans, Le Pen is also offering “more tax cuts for companies”, France 24 reported.\n\nLooking abroad\n\nMacron winning the majority of the votes in the first round marked “a moment of relief for policymakers across the EU and Nato”, said the Financial Times’s (FT) European diplomatic correspondent Henry Foy.\n\nThe French president has accused Le Pen of having a secret plan for “Frexit”, The Times reported, despite her tempering her public opposition to EU membership.\n\nLe Pen has also threatened to “pull France out of transatlantic military alliance Nato’s integrated command”, Reuters said, a move that would present a major “challenge to the West’s post-Cold War security architecture”.\n\nMeanwhile, said the FT’s Foy, her “populist economic views on state aid and the lowering of domestic taxes on consumer goods would break EU free market regulations”. And she would “likely derail the Franco-German relationship that has defined much of recent EU policymaking and steered the bloc’s development”.\n\nHer opponents also “accuse her of being too close to Moscow”, Reuters reported. National Rally “received a bank loan from a Russian bank in 2014”, while Le Pen was hosted at the Kremlin by Vladimir Putin shortly before the 2017 election.\n\nShe has condemned Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and “broadly supports” targeted sanctions against Moscow, the BBC said. But she has stated on multiple occasions that she does not “want French people to suffer the consequences of sanctions” on oil and gas.\n\nFrance “imports much of its natural gas through pipelines from Russia, using it for residential and commercial energy”, the broadcaster reported, prompting Le Pen to argue that any economic levies that impact energy supplies will exacerbate the country’s cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThird time lucky?\n\nShould Le Pen win, France will have replaced a “radical centrist” with an “a historic admirer of Putin who would flout EU rules by favouring French citizens for everything from housing to jobs”, said The Economist.\n\nFor those who are horrified by the prospect of her presidency, her polling numbers are “alarmingly high”, the paper added. And a buoyant Le Pen has told Le Parisien: “Those who did not vote for Macron are destined to join me. I can win this election.”\n\nIn her third pitch for the presidency, Le Pen can almost certainly count on the support of Eric Zemmour’s 2.4 million voters. The far-right former television pundit won 7% of the vote in the first round and has called on his supporters to back Le Pen in the run-off.\n\nShe also has the endorsement of nationalist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who won 725,305 votes in the first round. If all of Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan’s voters back her, she can bank on winning around 33% of the vote in the run-off.\n\nMacron’s electoral arithmetic is a little more tricky. He won 27.8% of the vote in the first round and is widely expected to pick up the 5% of voters who backed Green candidate Yannick Jadot, as well as the 4.8% that voted for the conservative Valérie Pécresse.\n\nThe outcome of the election may come down to where Mélenchon voters turn, with their candidate out of the race. He has told his supporters not to back Le Pen, but has so far refused to directly endorse Macron.\n\nInstead, he yesterday launched a consultation offering supporters the chance to choose between abstention, spoiling their ballots or backing Macron. His 7.7 million left-wing supporters may end up choosing France’s next president.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Rafi Schwartz", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/opinions/france-election-macron-le-pen-far-right-alouane/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Macron flirted with the far-right.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nToulouse CNN —\n\nWhen he was first elected French President in 2017, Emmanuel Macron promised that over the next five years he would do everything to ensure people would no longer have “any reason to vote for the extremes.”\n\nUnfortunately for the French electorate, Macron fell short of this promise to stem the rise of the far-right. In the wake of his 2017 victory, the political landscape shifted dramatically, with Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party being the main beneficiary.\n\nNow, just days away from France’s presidential election on Sunday, Macron again faces Le Pen in a rematch of their 2017 contest – and this time, Le Pen is riding a late surge in support that puts her a breath behind Macron’s lead.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Macron’s administration flirted with the same right-wing themes that have powered Le Pen’s rise – including Islam, security and immigration. Indeed, the entire political landscape in France is not immune to the appeal of policies that have profound effects on anyone who was not born White and on French soil.\n\nWhether or not Macron retains his seat, the effects of the creeping acceptance of the premises fueling Le Pen’s rise will be profound.\n\nThe focus on French Muslims, in particular, has been marked by a steady increase in fear-mongering for votes over the past 30 years. As successive waves of terrorist attacks in France galvanized public opinion since the mid-1980s, state authorities have been trying to create a framework to oversee Muslim religious practices and organization, through the idea of creating a “French Islam.”\n\nBut in the past 10 years, the threat has expanded from public safety to include Muslims being seen as an existential threat to the cultural identity of what is being called “traditional France.”\n\nSeeing an opportunity to ride a wave of discontent, politicians have pushed measures instrumentalizing the once liberal concept of laïcité (France’s form of secularism), including banning full-face coverings and burkinis in public spaces.\n\nWhile Macron is seen as an alternative to the far-right, he has also attempted to play both sides – putting on a liberal face for an international audience, while quietly embracing the very policies that the far-right has championed at home.\n\nTo lead this charge, Macron appointed Gérald Darmanin to the Ministry of Interior, one of the most powerful ministries in France. Darmanin has polarized the electorate with a staunch support for the French police, gaining strong support from influential police unions while alienating much of the left.\n\nFurthermore, critics accuse Darmanin of playing into anti-Muslim hatred with inflammatory rhetoric and action. In a vivid illustration of the Macron Administration’s rightward shift, last year Darmanin accused Le Pen of “being soft on Islam” in the midst of the debate around the Law Strengthening Respect For the Principles of the Republic (Anti-Separatism Law) of August 2021.\n\nThe anti-separatism bill was part of Macron’s strategy ahead of the 2022 presidential election to take some wind out of the far-right’s sails.\n\nUnder the law, non-profit organizations are subject to signing a “contract of republican commitment” – by which they must pledge respect to liberty, equality, fraternity, human dignity and public order. As a result, public authorities can arbitrarily deny, claim reimbursement or withdraw support to associations they deem are not respecting said values.\n\nSome associations fear that the heart of their activities (such as providing support to undocumented people, or human rights activist groups denouncing government discriminatory policies) could be deemed a violation of public order – and as a consequence, lose their funding.\n\nFacing a fractured field on the left, analysts predicted Macron was trying to lure some right-leaning voters away from Le Pen by taking action on some of the far right’s focal issues. Indeed, Darmanin declared in February 2022 that he wished that “far-right voters would vote for us (Macron’s party)”.\n\nMeanwhile, Le Pen has done her own version of a face-lift, de-emphasizing the harsher elements of her platform, while refusing to concede the underlying ideology that her party pioneered over the past 30 years.\n\nHer campaign promises include amending the Constitution to restrict immigration, family reunification and asylum that she deems a threat to France’s identity. Le Pen’s manifesto also contains measures for a legal distinction between “native-born French” and “others,” for access to employment or social benefits.\n\nLe Pen also announced her intention to extend the ban on the wearing of the headscarf in public spaces on the grounds of protecting Laïcité and the 1905 Law on Separation of Church and State. Laïcité has been understood for most of the 20th century as imposing neutrality upon the state and its civil servants, while guaranteeing religious freedom and freedom of conscience for private individuals\n\nBut since the 1990s, the understanding of laïcité has evolved and been interpreted as limiting religious expressions, more specifically Muslim ones. This has primarily been implemented through legislation restricting the wearing of visible religious signs, especially the wearing of the headscarf by some Muslim women.\n\nMacron sometimes unwittingly feeds into this narrative, once asking a young French Muslim woman wearing a headscarf if she was wearing a headscarf “by choice” or “by force” and complimented her when she confirmed it was by choice.\n\nWhile Macron’s statement was baffling, as it’s unlikely he would have asked such a question to a Catholic nun wearing a veil, a Jew wearing a yarmulke or a Sikh wearing a turban, the President is clearly trying to backpedal from the actions of his administration and pretend measures like the Anti-Separatism Law never happened.\n\nOnce again, Muslims, and especially Muslim women, are being instrumentalized for electoral purposes. Regardless of who wins the election, the far-right has already won. They are shaping the agenda of French political debate. If Le Pen does not win this time, she or someone like her will most likely win another time.\n\nFrench Muslims are tired of being pawns in this political game. Muslims comprise an estimated 8.8% of the population of France yet take up almost all of the political and media discourse, while their voices are left out of the conversation.\n\nIslam and immigration are topics that the far-right loves to use for their agenda, and unfortunately Macron, and those before him, fell into this trap. If Macron wins, he will have to make amends with those he has affected. And he and his administration will have to stop treating their French Muslim citizens as if they were a population that needed to be tamed.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThere is a need to proactively and constructively engage with Muslims, put in place programs that fight discrimination, and stop weaponizing laïcité as a tool for political identity. Muslims are simply not the threat some politicians and pundits make them out to be. France needs to allow Muslims to be full French citizens on their own terms, to express their identities openly and honestly, in a manner that is both true to their faith yet unambiguously French.\n\nWhether or not Macron or Le Pen wins this weekend, there is no doubt that the political landscape is shifting under the feet of French voters.", "authors": ["Rim-Sarah Alouane"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/04/19/french-election-president-contenders/99440058/", "title": "French election: Closer look at top 5 presidential contenders", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFive candidates have emerged from the pack as serious contenders in France's presidential election on April 23 to replace unpopular François Hollande, who is not running again.\n\nThe vote will be watched closely as the latest test of anti-European Union and anti-immigration sentiment in Europe.\n\nIf no candidate wins a majority of the vote, which is highly likely given the large field, the top two candidates go head to head in a runoff on May 7. So far, polls suggest voters prefer a far right, far left or independent candidate over the traditional mainstream parties that have ruled France for the past half century.\n\nHere is a look at the top five candidates:\n\nMarine Le Pen, National Front\n\nLe Pen, 48, took control of the far-right National Front party from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 and epitomizes Europe's anti-EU and anti-immigration attitude.\n\nShe is a lawyer who has worked to soften the party's image following her father's strident rhetoric. The telegenic, twice-divorced mother of three children lives in the Paris suburbs. Her calls to forcibly expel illegal immigrants, close mosques linked to extremists and pull France out of the EU resonate with many middle class and rural voters.\n\nLe Pen wants to ban all visible religious symbols worn in public, including Muslim headscarves and Jewish Kippahs. She believes globalization and international organizations such as NATO and the International Monetary Fund have undermined the nation-state.\n\nLe Pen has been dogged for months by an anti-corruption probe into allegations that she improperly used EU funds to pay her personal assistant and bodyguard for jobs in France. She has denied breaking any rules and refused to submit to questioning until after the election.\n\nLe Pen helped her party achieve its best-ever showing in a presidential election when the National Front came in third in the first round of 2012's vote. Current polls show she stands a good chance of making the runoff.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, On the Move\n\nMacron, 39, who has never held elected office, is married to a former teacher 20 years his senior. If elected, he would be France's youngest president. While polls show a tight race with Le Pen in the first round, Macron has a sizable lead in projected second-round voting. The former investment banker was France's economy minister, but quit Hollande's government to run for president as an independent.\n\nThe business-friendly challenger has emerged from relative obscurity to adopt a centrist position viewed as a liberal alternative to Le Pen's populism, and a break from France's traditional left or right political leadership. He wants to invest in public health and infrastructure, cut corporate tax rates and modernization workplace rules in a country that cherishes its time off. The \"Macron Law\" is a bill he introduced as economy minister that allowed more stores to open on Sundays.\n\nFrançois Fillon, The Republicans\n\nFillon, 63, is an experienced political operator involved in French politics for more than three decades, having served in a number of cabinet posts and as prime minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy. He grew up in a strict Catholic household and lives in a 12th century castle in western France.\n\nHe had been favored to win the election after cruising to an upset victory in his party's primaries, but the center-right candidate has been dogged by scandals that have hurt his chances.\n\nFillon faces multiple counts of embezzlement over allegations that he placed his wife and two of his five children in taxpayer-financed jobs as aides. Ethics inquires also have been opened into his expensive tastes; French media reported that he once paid a tailor more than $50,000 for a suit. Fillon has refused to quit the race as the investigation into his personal affairs deepens.\n\nPolitically, he wants to shrink the size of government, remove a wealth tax on the rich and lengthen France's mandatory 35-hour work week. He also wants to invest heavily in national security and has spoken about the need for the EU to end sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea province in 2014.\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks Fillon has surged back into the running amid security fears. Fillon would be expected to take a tough line on keeping citizens safe and the issue of national security resurfaced just days before the vote with the killing of a policeman in Paris on Thursday night.\n\nBenoit Hamon, Socialist Party\n\nHamon, 49, the son of a dockworker and a secretary, is married with two children. He previously served as Hollande's education minister and defeated former Prime Minister Manuel Valls to win the nomination for the current ruling party. Hamon is known for his radical policies even within the left-wing Socialist Party. He wants to introduce a universal basic income plan that would boost the salaries of everyone earning under about $2,400 per month, decriminalize marijuana and make it harder for companies to fire workers. He wants France, which relies heavily on nuclear energy, to stop using it entirely by 2050.\n\nHamon is a long shot to win the presidency because the Socialist Party has failed to inspire voters after years of economic stagnation and a string of terrorist attacks that have shaken the French. Hamon, who has been dubbed the \"French Bernie Sanders,\" also risks losing votes to other leftist candidates.\n\nJean-Luc Melenchon, Left Party\n\nMelenchon, 65, is the son of a postmaster and teacher who lived in Morocco until his family moved to France when he was still a child. He is further to the left than Hamon, and is supported by France's Communist Party. He has served as a senator and in various ministerial positions. A fiery orator, Melenchon has capitalized on some of the disappointment with the Socialist Party. Among his campaign pledges: to redistribute wealth by imposing heavy taxes on the rich, reduce homelessness to zero and force employers to recognize burn-out as an occupational illness.\n\nMelenchon also wants a review of France's European treaties, although he has not explicitly called for France to leave the EU as has Le Pen. In the 2012 presidential vote, he came in fourth. Melenchon has resisted calls to drop out of the contest because it splits the left-wing vote.

They are followed by conservative Francois Fillon, with 19.9% and far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon with 19.2%, the Associated Press reports.\n\nLe Pen said Sunday her National Front party will represent “the great alternative” to the French people.\n\nFillon conceded defeat but Melenchon refused to step aside until votes from France's cities, where he and Macron draw much of their support, had been counted.\n\n“The time has come to free the French people,” Le Pen said at her election day headquarters in the northern French town of Henin-Beaumont.\n\nMacron and Le Pen have vastly different visions for how to govern France, and of French identity.\n\nLe Pen wants to pull the nation out of the EU and close the country's borders to new immigrants. Macron has broken with France's traditional left or right political leadership to run as an independent and promised to invest in public infrastructure and modernize France's workforce.\n\nMacron said in a speech to his supporters that France was going through a unique moment in its history and said that if elected he would govern on behalf of all French patriots. Macron has never held elected office and his independent On the Move party did not even exist a year ago.\n\nProtesters angry about Le Pen's results scuffled with police. Crowds gathered on the Place de la Bastille, and police fired tear gas to disperse an increasingly rowdy gathering as riot officers surrounded the area.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve urged voters to support Macron in next month's final round, as did defeated conservative candidate Fillon.\n\n“Extremism can only bring unhappiness and division to France. As such, there is no other choice than to vote against the extreme right,” he said.\n\nMarion Abonnenc, 21, a student in Paris, said she was \"satisfied\" and \"relieved\" that her choice among the candidates is pulling ahead.\n\n\n\n\"I support Macron but also voted against the extremes which I really don't want to see in the second round,\" she said. \"Marine Le Pen has a heinous message which really doesn't correspond to my values as a youth as a citizen of the world. And it's not the image of France I want to convey.\"\n\nAt Le Pen's campaign base 120 miles north of Paris, Jerome Leroy, 34, an entrepreneur, was ecstatic over the results.\n\n\"I'm very happy with the results, it's well done, it's a good thing,\" he said. \"We managed to get the others out of the picture already, only one candidate remains: Emmanuel Macron who in fact will bring nothing more than (president) François Hollande does today. So now the real debate can start and we are happy about it — it's awesome.\"\n\nUnpopular Socialist President François Hollande did not run for re-election, unusual for an incumbent French leader.\n\nVoters chose between 11 candidates in the most unpredictable French election in decades and came amid heightened security in the wake of a terrorist attack in central Paris on Thursday in which a police officer was shot and killed.\n\nFrance's stagnant economy, its 10% unemployment rate and national security concerns topped concerns for the 47 million eligible voters. France has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris and there has been a steady drip of terrorism incidents in France over the last few years.\n\nAbout 60,000 police and soldiers were deployed across the country to secure polling stations for Sunday's vote.\n\nPresident Trump told the Associated Press on Friday that he was not officially endorsing Le Pen but he thought the attack on Thursday would \"probably help\" her because she is the candidate who is \"strongest on borders, and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that there was a \"very interesting election currently taking place in France.\"\n\nJabeen Bhatti reported from Paris; Kim Hjelmgaard contributed from London.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/europe/macron-unvaccinated-comments-vaccine-pass-intl/index.html", "title": "Macron says he wants to 'piss off' the unvaccinated | CNN", "text": "Paris CNN —\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said he “really wants to piss off” unvaccinated people, intensifying a heated political debate over strict new rules for those who have refused the shot.\n\nIn an interview with Le Parisien newspaper on Tuesday, Macron said: “I’m not for pissing off the French … Now the unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And so, we’re going to keep doing it, until the end. This is the strategy.”\n\nHis remarks drew swift and angry condemnation from opposition lawmakers, who were debating Macron’s proposed new set of rules for unvaccinated people that would ban them from much of public life.\n\nA parliamentary debate over the bill was suspended in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and will restart later in the day, raising doubts over whether the stricter vaccine pass will take effect by the government’s intended January 15 deadline.\n\nThe proposed legislation would replace France’s health pass with a vaccine pass, meaning proof of vaccination is necessary for access to a range of everyday activities, from entering restaurants and bars to traveling inside the country. It would no longer accept proof of a negative test or recent recovery from Covid.\n\n“I’m not going to put them in jail, I’m not going to forcibly vaccinate them, and so, you have to tell them: from January 15, you will no longer be able to go to the restaurant, you will no longer be able to have a drink, go for a coffee, to the theater, you will no longer go to the movies,” Macron told Le Parisien.\n\nMacron described those opposed to vaccination as “irresponsible,” adding that “they undermined the strength of a nation.”\n\n“When my freedom threatens that of others, I become irresponsible,” he said. “An irresponsible person is no longer a citizen.”\n\nHis remarks were immediately seized on by his rivals in this year’s presidential election. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said on Twitter that “a president shouldn’t say that,” calling Macron “unworthy of his office” and claiming he wants to make unvaccinated people “second-class citizens.”\n\nThe controversy came amid a tense debate in France over how to deal with the unvaccinated minority of the population.\n\nParliamentarian Patricia Miralles told CNN affiliate BFMTV that she has received dozens of threats since the first parliamentary discussions on the health pass in July 2021. Another legislator, Ludovic Mendes, told the news channel that as an elected official, he has faced “permanent hate, constant death threats” from some members of the public since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nFrance has vaccinated around 74% of its total population, one of the higher rates in the EU. But it has been heavily hit by the more transmissible Omicron variant, and has reported record infections in recent days.\n\nIt registered 271,686 new cases on Tuesday, its highest load to date. Hospitalizations also reached their highest rate since May, with 20,186 Covid patients being cared for.\n\nMuch of Europe is facing similar sky-high figures as Omicron sweeps through its populations. The UK and Italy both also saw record rates of infections on Tuesday, and Germany’s caseload increased sharply on last week.\n\nBut countries are taking varying approaches in light of Omicron’s reduced severity. Several European states imposed new restrictions over the Christmas period, with Italy implementing an outdoor mask mandate and the Netherlands going into lockdown. Meanwhile in England, where vaccine passes for some settings were introduced in early December, the UK’s health secretary said Tuesday that “no further restrictions” were needed.", "authors": ["Joseph Ataman Dalal Mawad Rob Picheta", "Joseph Ataman", "Dalal Mawad", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}]}

Cory Booker of New Jersey concluded a marathon 25-hour speech, which broke the record for the longest speech ever made on the Senate floor.\n\nHe used almost all of the 25 hours to criticize President Donald Trump, special government employee and tech billionaire Elon Musk and the \"harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability (and) core foundations of our democracy\" he said the president has inflicted.\n\nWhile the historic speech is making headlines, it’s also going viral online. And a lot of people are throwing the word “filibuster” around.\n\nBooker’s speech was longer than the longest filibuster in Senate history by about an hour, but it wasn’t technically a filibuster.\n\nHere’s what a filibuster is, exactly how long Booker held the Senate floor and some highlights from his speech.\n\nWhat is a filibuster?\n\nPut simply, a filibuster is a tactic senators sometimes use to delay voting on legislation by talking for as long as they can. When a senator or group of senators filibuster, they’re exercising their right to unlimited debate.\n\n“Whether praised as the protector of political minorities from the tyranny of the majority, or attacked as a tool of partisan obstruction, the right of unlimited debate in the Senate, including the filibuster, has been a key component of the Senate’s unique role in the American political system,” according to the U.S. Senate website.\n\nWhy wasn't Sen. Cory Booker's speech a filibuster?\n\nThe reason why Booker’s speech wasn’t technically a filibuster is because, while it exercised his right to unlimited debate, it was not an effort to delay a specific piece of legislation.\n\nJust 15 minutes before Booker took the Senate floor, he posted a video on X (formerly known as Twitter) explaining why he intended to hold the floor for as long as he was physically able.\n\n“I am about to go to the Senate floor, where I intend to be recognized. And when I am, I am not going to stop speaking, I’m going to not stop standing. I am going to go for as long as I am physically able to go,” Booker said in the video.\n\n“I have been hearing from people all over my state and indeed all over the nation, calling upon folks in congress to do more — to do things that recognize the urgency and the crisis of the moment.”\n\nWhat is the longest filibuster in U.S. history?\n\nThe longest filibuster in the U.S. Senate’s history was a speech made by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, who held the Senate floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 to delay voting on the Civil Rights Act.\n\nBooker’s speech ended at 25 hours and 5 minutes.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY, Booker — who became the first Black person to represent New Jersey in the Senate in 2013 — told reporters after the speech he was “very aware” of Thurmond's record.\n\n“I've always felt it was a strange shadow to hang over this institution ... It always seemed wrong,” he said.\n\nCory Booker’s 25-hour speech: Here are some highlights\n\nHere are some notable highlights from Sen. Booker’s historic 25-hour speech:\n\nBooker opened by quoting the late civil rights leader and former U.S. Rep. John Lewis’s famous phrase about getting into “good trouble.” “Get in good trouble. Necessary trouble. Help redeem the soul of America,” he quoted.\n\nTwo hours and 45 minutes in, Booker had a Senate page remove his chair to eliminate the temptation to sit down.\n\nBooker talked about defending health care, what he called Trump’s dangerous approach to immigration, the environment and energy, how Trump's and Musk’s policies have affected farmers, threats to Social Security benefits and Americans who depend on it, education, national safety, free speech, America’s role on the world stage and the housing crisis, among other things.\n\nTo illustrate his points, Booker read letters he received from constituents that spoke to his points about health care, housing, Social Security and other benefit programs in the U.S.\n\nHe ended his marathon speech the same way he started it, mentioning the John Lewis quote. “He said for us to go out and cause some good trouble, necessary trouble to redeem the soul of our nation. Let's be bold in America for a vision that inspires with hope. It starts with the people of the United States of America,” Booker said.\n\n“By Tuesday afternoon, he was rocking back and forth in his black tennis shoes and leaning lightly on his desk in between monologues,” USA TODAY reported.\n\n“Booker, however, did allow other Democratic senators to give short speeches and ask questions to give him a rest from speaking.”\n\nCan you talk about anything during a filibuster?\n\nDuring a filibuster, senators can technically talk about any topic they choose, but they typically don't stray too far off-topic from the legislation at hand.\n\nIn Booker’s case, he didn’t stray from his examples of how the Trump administration is, from his and many Democrats’ perspectives, harming the American people.\n\nFilibusters can have their funny moments\n\nThere are some funny examples of filibustering in pop culture, which imagine what it would be like for a government official to blabber on about something that has nothing at all to do with their job.\n\nOne of the most famous (fake) filibuster moments of the 21st century comes from the sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” in which Patton Oswalt famously plays a character that filibusters the Pawnee City Council to prevent them from voting.\n\nIn the scene, which was completely improvised, Oswalt’s character proposes his plot for the then-upcoming seventh “Star Wars” movie.\n\nCory Booker’s speech: Where to watch the full video\n\nYou can watch all 25 hours and 5 minutes of Booker’s speech, which began on Monday, March 31, and ended on Tuesday, April 1, on C-SPAN’s website.\n\nBooker’s YouTube channel also has a playlist of highlights from the marathon speech.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Riley Beggin, Anthony Robledo, David M.

Cory Booker was not officially filibustering, a practice that dates back to 1789.\n\nA defining feature of the U.S. Senate for more than two centuries, the concept of using long speeches to delay action or bring awareness to a cause has been at the heart of some of the most contentious legislative battles in American history.\n\nCory Booker, the U.S. Senator from New Jersey, started his record-breaking hold on the Senate floor on Monday, March 31, with a speech criticizing the second Trump administration's policies and tactics. Unlike many of his purposely long-winded predecessors, Booker is not blocking a specific bill or action on legislation, so it is technically not a filibuster. Instead, he is using the speech to highlight what he sees as the threat posed by Trump, Elon Musk and other allies to the government and democracy.\n\nHe may go down as one of the most indefatigable politicians in U.S. Senate history, but Booker is not the first to adopt the tactic.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Senate’s earliest days. On Sept. 22, 1789, Pennsylvania Sen. William Maclay recorded in his diary that Virginia senators were deliberately stalling a vote by prolonging debate. By the 1830s, the strategy was widely recognized, according to Senate records. Two decades later, it had a name. The term filibuster, derived from the Dutch word for \"freebooter\" and the Spanish \"filibusteros,\" which referred to pirates raiding Caribbean islands, entered American politics in 1853 thanks to Mississippi Sen. Albert Brown.\n\n“I saw my friend standing on the other side of the House filibustering,” he quipped.\n\nA month later, North Carolina Sen. George Badger complained about “filibustering speeches.” The name stuck.\n\nAttempts to curb filibusters followed almost immediately. In 1841, Henry Clay threatened to change Senate rules to limit debate as Democrats refused to stop talking when the Senate Whigs tried to create a national bank. They not only endured. They thrived.\n\nFilibusters grew more frequent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, making it harder for the Senate to function.\n\nIn 1917, after years of debate and pressure from President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate adopted Rule 22, allowing a two-thirds vote to end debate through a procedure known as cloture. Two years later, the rule was tested when senators used cloture to cut off a filibuster against the Treaty of Versailles. Even with the rule in place, filibusters remained difficult to overcome. In 1975, the cloture threshold was lowered from two-thirds to three-fifths, or 60 votes. Further rule changes in the 2010s ended filibusters on nominations, but they remain in place for legislation.\n\nSome filibusters have played out much like those seen in the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, which portrayed a lone senator holding the floor for hours. In 1917, then-Wisconsin Sen. Robert La Follette used the filibuster to defend free speech during wartime. Louisiana Sen. Huey Long, much like Booker, made it a tool to combat policies he believed favored the wealthy. Oregon Sen. Wayne Morse used it to bring attention to issues he felt were being ignored.\n\nThe longest solo speech prior to Booker belonged to Strom Thurmond, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957 against a civil rights bill.

That's great! But Democrats ...", "text": "Overnight, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., made history with the longest speech on the Senate floor in history. For 25 hours and five minutes from Monday into Tuesday, he showed Democrats what a protest in Donald Trump’s second presidency should look like.\n\nBut it's not enough.\n\n“I’ve been hearing from people all over my state and indeed all over the nation, calling upon folks in Congress to do more, to do things that recognize the urgency, the crisis of the moment,” Booker said in an X post before taking the floor Monday night. He quoted the late Rep. John Lewis, a Civil Rights Movement titan, saying he felt the responsibility to cause “good trouble.”\n\nWhile Booker’s speech is an exemplary form of protest in the Senate, it does not change the fact that Democrats – namely those in leadership positions, like New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries – need to be doing all they can to show Americans that they are standing up to the cruel realities of the Trump regime.\n\nRepublicans have been conquered by MAGA's hate and are running the government accordingly. Why aren't Democrats pointing that out at every turn?\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCory Booker's stand should move Democrats to action\n\nPrior to this, I had been disappointed by Democrats’ lack of action in Congress. Their decision to hold up signs during Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress last month was honestly more embarrassing than empowering.\n\nThe shining moment for Democrats from that day came from Texas Rep. Al Green, who stood up and shouted down Trump until he was escorted out of the House chamber.\n\nThere have been plenty of calls for Democrats to do more. I’ve certainly questioned why Schumer and Jeffries, my representatives and two of the most influential figures in the party, aren’t holding daily news conferences or demonstrations against the administration.\n\nIf Democrats believe that Trumpism is genuinely akin to fascism, as former Vice President Kamala Harris said on the campaign trail, Democratic leaders need to channel that urgency into everything they do.\n\nSen. Booker seems to know what’s at stake.\n\nBooker's speech was a historic moment\n\nBooker’s Senate speech is monumental for more than just standing against Trump. There’s also the fact that Booker broke a record previously held by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, who in 1957 spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the passage of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n“I’m not here, though, because of his speech,” Booker said just before breaking the record set by Thurmond. “I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.”\n\nBeating Thurmond’s record signals American voters that hate will not prevail. It reminds us how far we have come as a country – and how far we still have to go now that Trump is trying to reset things.\n\nWill Democrats now organize against MAGA or keep sitting still?\n\nDemocrats should look to Booker as an example, not the beginning and end of their activism. The same day the senator completed his speech, Republicans won two House seats in a special election in Florida.\n\nThere’s a lot more work to be done.\n\nLike Rep. Lewis famously said, Democrats must “get in good trouble.” They must show the American people that they are standing up to the destruction of our democracy.\n\nThey also need to be organizing across the country, down to the local level, so that they can empower voters and show them that the party cares about more than pearl-clutching when Trump says something genuinely concerning.\n\nBooker’s speech is a start to what could be a pivotal moment for the party. The rest of the Democrats must not let it pass by. They have to organize, protest and show the country that there is a party fighting for those of us who are dismayed by the direction this country is headed.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter:@sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/04/01/cory-booker-speech-longest-senate-history-filibuster/82757263007/", "title": "Is Cory Booker's speech the longest in Senate history?

Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, delivered the longest recorded floor speech in Senate history on Tuesday, breaking the record set by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond in 1957.\n\nBooker began speaking on the Senate floor at 7 p.m. Monday evening to protest President Donald Trump's policies.\n\nAt 7:19 p.m. on Tuesday, Booker broke Thurmond's record of 24 hours and 18 minutes, which he made while speaking against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the first major civil rights bill since Reconstruction, according to a report from USA TODAY.\n\nHere's what to know about Booker's marathon speech.\n\nWhat are the longest filibusters in Senate history? Is Booker's speech the longest?\n\nIt is now.\n\nAxios reports that the previous record for the longest individual speech belonged to the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Democrat who later joined the Republican Party. Thurmond spoke against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nStrom took the record from Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon, who in 1953 held a filibuster that lasted 22 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nThe longest multispeaker filibuster was 60 days, per Axios, when some Southern lawmakers attempted to block the Civil Rights Act in 1964.\n\nWhat are the longest all-night Senate sessions?\n\nAccording to Senate records (through 2017), there have been 38 all-night sessions since 1915.\n\nThe longest one was in 1960, lasting 125 hours and 16 minutes from noon on Monday, Feb. 29, all the way to 5:31 p.m. on Saturday, March 5. There was one 15-minute recess on March 2.\n\nThe longest unbroken session during that period took 82 hours, 2 minutes, from March 2 to 5. Senators were considering a bill to lease a building at Fort Crowder, Missouri, that was being used as a vehicle for civil rights amendments.\n\nSenators frequently delivered long speeches in the 19th century, the Senate Historical Office noted in a list of the longest Senate speeches dating back to 1900, but it's not possible to determine exactly how long they lasted from the existing record.\n\nIs Cory Booker conducting a filibuster?\n\nBooker's speech is not considered a filibuster, USA TODAY reports, because he is not attempting to stall or block legislation. However, the Senate floor will remain open so long as he is speaking.\n\nWhy did Cory Booker speak for more than 24 hours?\n\nIn a pre-recorded video posted to X while Booker was on the Senate floor, Booker said he is speaking about \"what Donald Trump is doing to our nation.\"\n\n\"It's my plan to continue to go for as long as I possibly can,\" he said in the update shortly after 8 a.m. ET. \"I know we have the power; I believe the power of the people is greater than the people in power.\"\n\nWho is Cory Booker?\n\nCory Booker is a Democratic U.S. Senator who has represented New Jersey since 2013, when he became the first Black person to hold the seat.

Cory Booker's record-breaking speech.\n\nThe New Jersey Democrat gave the Bills a shoutout during his 25-hour, 6-minute marathon address that sacked the previous mark for longest speech ever delivered on the U.S. Senate floor.\n\nBooker was joined by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer for a colloquy in the speech's 15th hour. Booker joked it's rare for a man from Brooklyn, like Schumer, to be complimentary of a man from Newark, New Jersey, like Booker. Schumer reminded his colleague that they're both New York Giants fans.\n\n\"There is only one football team in New York, and that's the Bills,\" Booker said, pointing out that the New York Giants and New York Jets play in New Jersey and Brooklyn stole the Nets from New Jersey in the NBA. \"I don't have to yield. This is the one time in my life I get the last word with my much more senior, much wiser friend and senator.\"\n\n\"Go Bills,\" said Schumer, who also roots for the Bills and has lobbied to keep the organization in Buffalo during his tenure. Schumer wore a Bills beanie while leaving President Donald Trump's inauguration in January.\n\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen winked at a reporter after reminding him there's only one New York team following a Bills' victory over the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey in 2019.\n\nBooker, who played college football at Stanford, couldn't jump through a table, or his desk, to drive home his Buffalo reference. He was required to remain standing for the entirety of the speech.\n\nTo hold the floor, Booker also had to hold his bladder. He didn't sit, eat, or use the bathroom during his speech, essentially the opposite of a Bills tailgate. Booker fasted for about three days and stopped drinking fluids nearly 24 hours before his speech.\n\nThe speech was a symbolic protest to denounce the Trump administration. It surpassed South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond's 24-hour, 18 minute filibuster opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nDid Cory Booker play football?\n\nCorry Booker attended North Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan in New Jersey, where he played football and was named to the 1986 USA Today All-USA high school football team as a defensive back.\n\nThe 24-member All-USA team included future NFL star running backs Emmitt Smith and Ricky Watters, future first-round pick and Pro Bowl linebacker Alfred Williams, and NFL safety and current ESPN analyst Louis Riddick.\n\nBooker played college football at Stanford, where he transitioned to tight end and made the Pac-10 All-Academic team. He had 20 receptions for 199 yards and a touchdown in 22 career game for the Cardinal.\n\nBooker was the senior class president at Stanford in 1990.

Mike DeWine and the Ohio State Legislature are backpedaling on adequately funding our public schools. The budget proposal (House Bill 96) for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 uses costs from fiscal year 2022, shifting more of the burden to local school districts and taxpayers.\n\nAt the same time, the proposed budget increases funding for vouchers for both private and non-public, non-chartered schools. It is clear that the legislature favors private, religious and unaccountable schools over public schools.This is unacceptable.\n\nOur K-12 public school students deserve full funding. It’s up to our legislature to do the right thing: use current costs and ensure that the Fair School Funding Plan is properly phased in.Anne Neiwirth, Columbus\n\nCory Booker is the voice of democracy\n\nIn a time of deep political division, Sen.

Their medical records were drawn from a previous study called Whitehall II, which began in the mid-1980s.\n\nOut of nearly 8,000 people, researchers found 521 had been diagnosed with dementia at an average age of 77.\n\nThe length and sample size of the study make its results significant, experts say, and help to fill in gaps left by previous five- or 10-year studies.\n\n“We know that changes in sleep are commonly reported in individuals with dementia,” said Claire Sexton, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer’s Association. “There has been a chicken and the egg debate about what comes first and whether impaired sleep is a consequence of having dementia or whether it can be a contributing factor to its development.”\n\nPrevious studies have suggested long sleep duration also may be associated with an increased risk of dementia; however, study authors in Tuesday's report said they found no evidence to support that hypothesis.\n\nSexton speculates the link between long sleep duration and dementia may be inconsistent because fewer people sleep longer than an average of seven hours per night compared to those who sleep less than six hours. A small sample size may impact results.\n\nMore studies are needed to understand the mechanism behind how sleep could impact dementia, said Kristine Wilckens, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved with the study.\n\n'Life is a gift': Tony Bennett reveals battle with Alzheimer's disease\n\nBut experts have hypothesized from previous studies that sleep may help clear away the buildup of abnormal protein deposits characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“Parts of the brain involved with sleep-wake regulation tend to have early neurodegeneration,” Wilckenssaid. “Proteins involved by Alzheimer’s disease are influenced by the sleep-wake cycle and clearance of those pathological proteins are greater during sleep.”\n\nAlthough the study’s length and sample size help to reinforce its results, experts say the study has some limitations. For example, the participants involved in the earlier Whitehall study were not representative of all socioeconomic statuses and racial or ethnic populations.\n\n“The study was founded in the 1980s and based upon U.K. civil servants … this was predominately white male (and) healthier than the general population,” Sexton said.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the prevalence rates of Alzheimer’s disease – a form of dementia – ranges from 14% to 500% higher among Black Americans than among whites.\n\nWilckens says the study doesn’t take into account quality of sleep, which she said also could have an impact on cognitive function later in life.\n\nWhile there may be limitations to the study, experts say it highlights the importance of sleep and how certain behaviors can contribute to the risk of developing dementia. Americans can use this information to not only change their sleep habits but also incorporate a healthy diet and daily physical exercise to help reduce that risk.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Your COVID-19 questions ...", "text": "Free Press readers have lots of questions about COVID-19. We've asked the experts and tracked down sources to help sort through the information swirling about the virus, the vaccines, and more.\n\nPlease continue to ask us questions and we'll continue to seek answers for our readers. Submit your questions to us by emailing Free Press health reporter Kristen Jordan Shamus at kshamus@freepress.com and we'll answer as many as we can.\n\nHere's this week's Q&A:\n\nQUESTION: How long does protection from a COVID-19 vaccine last?\n\nANSWER: It's too soon to know. The vaccines are new, and it's unclear how long protection lasts, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people,\" the CDC reports in its COVID-19 vaccine FAQ. \"If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.\"\n\nQUESTION: I saw that the state health department announced people ages 60 and older can get a COVID-19 vaccine if the clinics remove barriers to access to vaccines. What does that mean?\n\nANSWER: Under a new pilot program, places providing COVID-19 vaccines can apply to the state health department by March 1 for up to 2,500 doses of vaccine aimed at reaching the most vulnerable Michigan residents ages 60 and older. The awards will be announced March 8 and delivered to the vaccine administration sites by March 10.\n\nThe vaccine sites must show that they are removing barriers to vaccine access for Michiganders 60 and older who live in communities with a high Social Vulnerability Index, which includes such factors as socioeconomic status, English as a second language, multifamily households, people without access to transportation, single-parent households, minority status and more.\n\nFor example, the sites may provide transportation to the vaccine center for people without transportation, offer special outreach for residents for whom English is a second language or for people with disabilities. They also are encouraged to partner with community-based organizations that can help reach out to get residents vaccinated.\n\n“We are working hard to eliminate any barriers to vaccine access. Your ability to get a vaccine should not be impacted by whether you are in a rural or urban part of the state, are lower income, or don’t have access to a car, a computer, the Internet or don’t speak English,\" said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive, in a news release. \"This is what equity means.”\n\nQ: I am 64 years old with no underlying health problems. I'd like to sign up for the vaccine and have the health department call me when it's my turn, but it looks as if they only want currently eligible people to sign in. Is this the case?\n\nANSWER: It depends on a few factors, including where you live.\n\nIf you live in Macomb County, residents 60 and older are eligible now to make a vaccine appointment. The vaccine hotline (586-463-8777) opens at 8:30 a.m. every Tuesday. You can also book a vaccine appointment through the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) program if you need a bus ride to get a vaccine in Macomb County. The number to call for that is 586-421-6579 or you can send an email to macombvaccine@smartbus.org and include your name, address, phone number and date of birth. Macomb County will contact individuals from the wait list as appointments become available.\n\nIf you live in Oakland County, you can sign up on a waiting list, and when it’s your turn, you’ll get notification. Here’s a link with details about how to get on the list: oaklandcountyvaccine.com.\n\nIf you live in Wayne County, the health department is only vaccinating people 65 and older. The county launched a few clinics this week in communities like Canton, Inkster, Hamtramck, Highland Park, Melvindale, Romulus and Wayne, but again, they’re only for people 65 and older. Details about that program are available here: bit.ly/2P6DJ71.\n\nIf you live in the city of Detroit, are 60 or older with chronic illness, you can call 313-230-0505 (9 a.m.-6 p.m. Mon.-Fri.) to make an appointment to get a shot at the drive-up clinic at the TCF Center garage.\n\nAnd no matter where you live, if you drive a Detroit resident to get a coronavirus shot in the city, you can get one, too, as long as you are at least 55 years old. It's part of Detroit's \"Good Neighbor\" program.\n\nMichiganders also can go to the state's website, michigan.gov/covidvaccine, to learn about how to make an appointment in your area or call the COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 (press 1) 8 a.m.-5 p.m. M-F or 8 a.m.-1 p.m. Sat.-Sun.\n\nHealth officials also urge people to register for a vaccine with their local hospitals as well as the pharmacies in Michigan that are administering vaccines to people ages 65 and older:\n\nQ: Are those who have had a flu immunization responding better to COVID-19, worse or unknown?\n\nA: Influenza and coronavirus are completely different viruses, so it would seem to make sense that getting a vaccination for one wouldn't have any association with how the other virus will affect you. But research published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine suggests getting a flu shot might actually help when it comes to fighting COVID-19.\n\nData from hospital electronic health records from more than 2,000 adult patients in the University of Florida Health System shows those who had a flu shot within one year prior to contracting the coronaviruswere less likely to be hospitalized or end up needing treatment in an intensive care unit than those who didn't get the flu shot.\n\nThe patients all had COVID-19 between March and August 2020. Of them, 10.7% were considered up-to-date on the flu vaccine. Those who hadn't had a flu shot in the last year were 2.4 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with patients who did not get a flu shot. The odds of an ICU admission in people who didn't get a flu shot when they contracted the coronavirus was as 3.3 times higher compared with people who had gotten a dose of the flu vaccine.\n\nAlthough this was a small study, and involved electronic records review from just one hospital system, the study's authors noted: \"It is an intriguing prospect that influenza vaccination may be an effective protection against COVID-19 morbidity.\"\n\nQ: Many people have developed serious mental health issues directly related to the shutdown, including young people that I know. How many people have died in the U.S. because of the shutdown (but not due to having COVID)? How come the media does not make an effort to report this number or somehow quantify the negative impact of the shutdown?\n\nA: Loneliness isn't something typically listed on death certificates, so it's difficult to tally the number of people who've died from causes linked to the isolation people have experienced in the last year. Easier is totaling up COVID-19 deaths in long-term care facilities. In Michigan, that's 5,549 as of Feb. 22, according to state data.\n\nThat said, we can look at how many people die in a typical year of diseases like dementia, and compare it to what happened during 2020. Nationally, about 259,250 people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia were expected to die last year, according to the Alzheimer's Association. But the Free Press reported in January that the number of dementia deaths through the end of November, was 16% higher than expected, and 38,000 people who weren't expected to die did so in 2020.\n\nExperts predicted opioid overdose deaths would rise during the pandemic because people were isolated, many lost their jobs and were feeling a financial pinch. The data bore out that theory. Suspected opioid overdoses were up 15% from March 2019 to March 2020 in Michigan, and first responders used naloxone, the lifesaving rescue drug that can reverse an opioid overdose, 29% more in 2020 than in 2019, according to the University of Michigan's Injury Prevention Center.\n\nAnd earlier this month, state health officials released suicide and homicide data from the first half of 2020 that also can give a picture of how the beginning of the pandemic affected people. Suicides in Michigan were not higher in the first six months of 2020 than they were in 2019, though the homicide rate rose.\n\nQ: What percentage of the U.S. population has already had the virus? I’ve seen estimates of around 50%. Does this factor into herd immunity?\n\nA: According to the CDC's COVID data tracker, as of Thursday, 28,065,327 people have been infected with novel coronavirus in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the U.S. population was 332.6 million in 2020.\n\nThat means 8.4% of Americans are known to have been infected with COVID-19. Of course, the number of asymptomatic people who contracted the virus and did not know it are considered part of an undercounting of the true infection rate in the U.S., as are those who had symptoms but either didn't get a test or couldn't get a test. That means it is likely that far more than 8.4% have had coronavirus infections.\n\nColumbia University computer modeling using case numbers and cellphone data to analyze population mixing suggests the actual number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. could be closer to one-third of the population.\n\nThe percentage of people who need to be immune to achieve herd immunity varies with each disease and how infectious it is. To reach herd immunity against measles, for example, which is very infectious, requires about 95% of a population to be vaccinated according to the World Health Organization. For polio, it is about 80%.\n\nBefore the more contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2 were identified, some experts suggested about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reach herd immunity.\n\nBut now that more transmissible variants of the virus are spreading in Michigan and nationally, some epidemiologists have suggested herd immunity won't be achieved with SARS-CoV-2 until 85% or 90% of the population is vaccinated or has antibodies from infection.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that it is unknown how long antibodies from infection or vaccines protect a person from getting sick with novel coronavirus.\n\nQ: After I get two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, are social distancing AND a mask required? Or is it social distancing OR a mask required?\n\nA: The Mayo Clinic reports that even if you've had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine, you still need to wear a mask, and practice social distancing and wash your hands frequently.\n\n\"Until we have more information about how this vaccine impacts what we call asymptomatic transmission, we still have to wear the mask,\" said Dr. Abinash Virk, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases expert.\n\n\"Although we may be protected from severe infection, or even getting symptomatic COVID-19 infection, we don't know if people may pick up the virus and transmit it to somebody else. These studies — both Pfizer and Moderna — were really designed to see if the vaccine can prevent the symptomatic infection. They weren't designed to study if we can prevent transmission from one person to the other.\"\n\nAmong the reasons to continue to wear a mask:\n\nEven after getting vaccinated, there's a chance you could spread the virus to others. Wearing a mask and social distancing protects others.\n\nEarly research suggests the COVID-19 vaccines on the market right now might not be as effective against some of the highly contagious variants that are now spreading in the U.S. Wearing a mask and practicing social distancing protects you.\n\nThe vaccines are about 95% effective, which means about 1 person in 20 who are fully vaccinated could still get sick if exposed to coronavirus. While there is still a lot of virus circulating in the community, you protect yourself and others by continuing to wear a mask and practicing social distancing.\n\nContact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Additionally, more frequent flu vaccinations were associated with another 13% reduction.\n\n“Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention – the flu shot – may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer’s dementia,” said Albert Amran, a medical student at the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center who was involved in the study.\n\nResearchers also found the protective association between the vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer’s was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age. For example, those who go their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who first received it at 70.\n\nWhile the study doesn’t explain why flu vaccinations are linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, some experts speculate the vaccine may affect brain inflammation that could lead to the disease, said Dr. Steven DeKosky, professor of neurology at the University of Florida and deputy director of UF’s McKnight Brain Institute.\n\n“The vaccine activates the immune system to defeat the flu virus itself,” he said. “The activation may have beneficial effects that fight off or slow down the inflammation associated with AD.”\n\nHowever, the Mayo Clinic says most scientists believe Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time.\n\nNew CDC guidelines: People with mild to moderate COVID-19 only need to isolate 10 days\n\n“People like to argue that people who are more likely to get regular vaccinations are those that have regular primary care and are perhaps more likely to get preventive health interventions,” said Dr. Zaldy Tan, medical director at the University of California-Los Angeles Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care Program.\n\nThe findings add to the growing evidence of vaccination benefits as scientists work doubletime to create a coronavirus vaccine by 2021 – which only about half of Americans say they would get, according to a poll in May from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n“With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussion,” said Mari Carrillo, Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer. “It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes.”\n\nWhile people are hunkered down in their homes and are less likely to spread the seasonal flu, some experts are worried they also are less likely to get the annual vaccine. Before the pandemic, many Americans enjoyed the convenience of receiving their shot at the office.\n\nExperts hope people are proactive about visiting their local pharmacy or family doctor to get their flu shot this year, especially with flu season around the corner and coronavirus cases on the rise. Many worry both viruses could overwhelm hospitals in the fall.\n\n“(The study) is another good reason to get your flu shot and prevent that chaos from happening,” said DeKosky.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

The vaccine could become the third authorized by the federal Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“If it comes through, that’s a game-changer,” Gov. Phil Murphy said.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has a deal to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. government. Leaders of Operation Warp Speed, the federal program to develop and manufacture a COVID vaccine, said this month that unspecified production issues likely would slow the arrival of the initial doses.\n\n– Lindy Washburn, NorthJersey.com\n\nIn the headlines:\n\n►President Joe Biden on Thursday signed 10 executive orders aimed at combating the coronavirus as he outlined a 198-page comprehensive national strategy to address the pandemic, an endeavor he called \"a wartime undertaking.'' The plan calls for improved vaccine distribution, enhanced testing and broader use of masks, including new requirements in airports and many trains, airplanes and buses.\n\n►Britain's National Health Service is preparing at least two London buses to serve as makeshift ambulances so four COVID patients can be transported at once, The Guardian reports. The buses, to be staffed by intensive car physicians and nurses, are designed to ease the strain the pandemic has put on London ambulance services.\n\n►The push to inoculate Americans against the coronavirus is hitting a roadblock: A number of states are reporting they are running out of vaccine, and tens of thousands of people who managed to get appointments for a first dose are seeing them canceled. Last week the Health and Human Services Department suggested that states had unrealistic expectations for how much vaccine was on the way.\n\n►Florida’s surgeon general urged the federal government Wednesday to increase allotments of coronavirus vaccine to states like his where large concentrations of seniors face the greatest risk of illness and death from COVID-19.\n\n📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 24.6 million confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 409,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The global totals: More than 97.4 million cases and 2 million deaths.\n\n📘 What we're reading: The U.S. COVID-19 death toll now exceeds 409,000. That’s more than the number of Americans who died in WWII – and enough to fill every existing burial plot at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nTexas doctor charged with stealing vial of COVID vaccine\n\nA fired county public health doctor in Texas was charged with taking a vial of COVID-19 vaccine, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced in a Thursday press release.\n\nDr. Hasan Gokal took a vial that contained nine doses while working at a county vaccination site on Dec. 29, according to the district attorney's office. He told another employee what he did a week later, and that employee reported him to supervisors.\n\n“He abused his position to place his friends and family in line in front of people who had gone through the lawful process to be there,” Ogg said. “What he did was illegal and he’ll be held accountable under the law.”\n\nGokal was charged with theft by a public servant, a misdemeanor that \"carries a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine,\" according to the district attorney's office.\n\nBiden asks FEMA to set up 100 community vaccination centers\n\nCalling his plan to administer 100 million vaccines doses in his first 100 days in office \"one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken,'' President Joe Biden offered details on his strategy to improve the lagging vaccine rollout and address the pandemic.\n\nThose plans include enlisting the Federal Emergency Management Agency to put up 100 community vaccination centers in the next month, launching a pharmacy program to make vaccines available in local drug stores by early February and expanding the national pool of vaccinators.\n\n\"We'll move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated for free and create more places for them to get vaccinated,'' Biden said.\n\nExpansion of vaccine eligibility blamed for shortages\n\nThe Trump administration's push to have states vastly expand their vaccination drives to the nation’s estimated 54 million people 65 and older has contributed to vaccine shortages, public health experts say.\n\nThe push that began over a week ago has not been accompanied by enough doses to meet demand, according to state and local officials, leading to frustration and confusion and limiting states’ ability to attack the outbreak that has killed over 400,000 Americans.\n\nAs states have ramped up their distribution chains, authorities in California, New York, Florida, Ohio, West Virginia and Hawaii warned their supplies were running out. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer even inquired about buying vaccines directly from manufacturer Pfizer, but have not been authorized to do so.\n\nSome state and local public health officials have complained of not getting reliable information on the amount of vaccine they can expect, making it difficult to plan the inoculations.\n\nFauci returns, says vaccines are key to limiting impact of variants\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci is emphasizing the importance of an effective COVID-19 vaccination program, especially with the emergence of variants that might make the coronavirus even more contagious.\n\nThe nation’s top infectious disease expert returned to the White House podium Thursday to update the nation on the pandemic and address public fears about the spread of new variants around the globe. A variant that first appeared in the United Kingdom has been detected in at least 20 U.S. states and is twice as transmissible as the original strain, Fauci said.\n\nWhile the variant may not cause more severe disease, a more contagious virus could lead to more cases, hospitalizations and deaths, Fauci said, adding that the “more concerning” variant out of South Africa hasn’t shown up in the U.S. yet. Very early research suggests that variant, more so than the one in the U.K., may diminish the impact of vaccines, he said.\n\n“It is all the more reason why we should be vaccinating as many people as you possibly can,'' Fauci said. \"Viruses don’t mutate unless they replicate, and if you can suppress that by a very good vaccine campaign, then you can actually avoid this deleterious effect you might get from the mutations.”\n\n-- Grace Hauck\n\nFauci finds working for Biden's team 'liberating'\n\nAsked Thursday about his experience working on the pandemic response for two different administrations, Dr. Anthony Fauci said being able to share science was “liberating.” Fauci at times corrected information provided by former President Donald Trump during briefings, and said he did not enjoy doing that. He was eventually sidelined and had his public appearances limited.\n\n“It is very clear that there were things that were said, regarding things like hydroxychloroquine and things like that, that really was uncomfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,” Fauci said.\n\n“It was really something that you didn’t feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn’t be any repercussions about it,” he said. “The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is, and know that’s it, let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.”\n\n-- Grace Hauck\n\nNew administration reportedly stunned by Trump's lack of vaccine plan\n\nThe Biden administration's pandemic response team continues to express shock at the lack of a vaccine distribution plan under the Trump administration. CNN reported Thursday that one Biden administration source claimed no plan was left for them and that \"we are going to have to build everything from scratch.\"\n\nThe revelation is not really new – the Biden team has been complaining for weeks about the lack of cooperation and planning from the previous administration. Former President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed the threat from COVID, although he attempted to claim credit for the development of the vaccines. Jeff Zients, Biden's COVID-19 czar, said publicly Wednesday that \"what we're inheriting from the Trump administration is so much worse than we could have imagined.\"\n\nBiden signs more directives aimed at halting pandemic\n\nBiden is expected to sign an order reflecting U.S. intent to join the COVAX Facility, a project to deploy COVID-19 vaccines to people in need around the world, Dr. Anthony Fauci said. Fauci, Biden's top pandemic medical adviser, said the U.S. also will cease reducing American staff counts at the World Health Organization and will pay its financial obligations to the agency.\n\nBiden on Thursday also signed an order requiring people to wear masks in airports and most planes as he presses his national strategy to beat back the pandemic. All this comes hours after a busy Inauguration Day that saw Biden approve 15 executive orders, including a mandate requiring face masks be worn in buildings and on land controlled by the federal government.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nAmazon says it can help vaccinate 100 million Americans in 100 days\n\nAmazon is offering its help to President Joe Biden with the rollout of COVID vaccines and is working to get its employees inoculated \"at the earliest appropriate time.\" In a letter written to Biden and dated Wednesday, Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark said the e-commerce giant is prepared to leverage its operations to help vaccinate 100 million Americans in the first 100 days of the president's administration.\n\n\"Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort,\" Clark wrote.\n\n– Brett Molina\n\nEli Lilly says its monoclonal antibody treatment cuts risk of COVID-19\n\nA drug developed by Eli Lilly and Company dramatically reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 among nursing home residents, the company said. Of 299 residents, half of whom received a placebo, those randomized to receive the drug bamlanivimab had up to an 80% lower risk of contracting COVID-19, according to a study that has not yet been published. Health care providers at the same nursing homes also were statistically less likely to contract symptomatic COVID-19 after receiving bamlanivimab, which was delivered in a 4,200 mg dose. Among 41 residents who already tested positive for the virus, none died after receiving the drug compared to 4 deaths in the placebo group.\n\n“The results of this innovative study further support the belief that bamlanivimab – and potentially other monoclonal antibodies – can reduce symptoms and may even prevent COVID-19,” said Dr. Myron S. Cohen, who helped lead the study and directs the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina.\n\n– Karen Weintraub\n\nAlzheimer's deaths jump as lives of patients 'upended' by pandemic\n\nNationally, about 259,250 people with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia were expected to die last year, according to the Alzheimer's Association. But federal data analyzed by the association shows that the number of dementia deaths, at least through the end of November, was 16% higher than expected. Experts working on explanations for the added 40,000 deaths say it's possible some people died from undiagnosed cases of COVID-19. It's also possible that some saw the level of care they received from overworked caregivers decline with the pandemic. And there is the issue of coronavirus protocols that change routines, curtail visitors and force isolation.\n\n\"If you are confined in a place like that, you don’t have anybody to prod and do the things with you,\" said George Pitchford, 78, a retiree in Sylvan Lake, Michigan. \"I can’t imagine it not having an impact on your decline.\"\n\n– Georgea Kovanis, Detroit Free Press\n\nCDC extends federal eviction moratorium to March 31\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will extend an order preventing landlords from evicting tenants to March 31, protecting as many as 40 million Americans from displacement, new CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky announced Wednesday.\n\n\"We must act to get cases down and keep people in their homes and out of congregate settings – like shelters – where COVID-19 can take an even stronger foothold,'' Walensky said in a statement.\n\nA study by global investment firm Stout estimates up to 14 million households could already be close to eviction, with a rental shortfall of more than $24 billion.\n\nThe order, issued by former President Donald Trump in September, was set to expire on Jan. 31, but the CDC was directed to extend it during a flurry of executive orders signed Wednesday by President Joe Biden.\n\n– Joey Garrison and Courtney Subramanian, USA TODAY\n\nHealth experts: 2020 may be deadliest year in American history\n\nPreliminary numbers show 2020 is on track to become the deadliest year in U.S. history, with more than 3.2 million total deaths – about 400,000 more than 2019 – a sharp increase that public health experts attribute to COVID-19 and aligns with reported deaths from the disease.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2,835,533 U.S. deaths in 2019. Before the pandemic, models projected a slightly higher number, about 2.9 million deaths, for 2020, said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.\n\nIt’s not a coincidence, he said, that the 400,000 excess deaths closely resemble the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S., which had surpassed 407,000 as of Thursday at 2 p.m. ET, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\n“That is not a seasonal change or just a random bad year,\" Faust said. \"That is what every person who can correctly attest to these numbers can plainly see is a historic increase in excess mortality. If we put that together with the number of coronavirus deaths, it’s game, set, match.”\n\n– Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/04/alzheimers-disease-rates-rising-baby-boomers/1106292001/", "title": "Alzheimer's disease rates about to skyrocket as baby boomers age", "text": "DETROIT – She had researched Alzheimer's disease and its effects on the brain for years, but it wasn't until her own mother's memory began to slip that Dr. Eva Feldman, a University of Michigan neurologist, truly grasped how devastating the disease is.\n\nMargherita Feldman was 88 when she moved in June 2017 to the memory care unit of an assisted living home in Saline. And although her memory loss wasn't as acute as some of the other residents, it's when the cruelty of the disease – now the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States – and the scope of America's Alzheimer's crisis became clear to her daughter.\n\n\"I learned more about dementia and Alzheimer’s disease spending lots of hours in that memory care unit than I did as a long-standing, practicing neurologist,\" said Feldman, who is the director of the University of Michigan's Program for Neurology Research & Discovery. \"The people in the memory care unit, some were very violent. Some were very passive. Some were very young with really severe memory loss with early-onset Alzheimer’s. You could see the whole myriad of presentations and you could understand what an enormously difficult disease that it is for the patient, but also for the families.\"\n\nIn her work, but also while visiting with her mom, Feldman considered the enormity of the Alzheimer's problem: About 5.8 million Americans now have the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association. That number will climb to at least 13.8 million by 2050, a 138% rise, and as many as 1 in 3 people who live to be 85 in the United States will die with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"We are really in an epidemic,\" Feldman said, driven largely by baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964), who are growing older and coming to an age when the disease most commonly strikes.\n\nWhat is Alzheimer's disease?\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a form of dementia. Little is known about specifically what combination of factors causes Alzheimer's disease, though scientists say genetics, lifestyle and environmental exposures most likely play into it.\n\nDr. Rebecca Edelmayer, director of scientific engagement for the Alzheimer’s Association, explained that three specific brain changes define the disease:\n\nA protein called amyloid beta builds up in the brain, forming plaques.\n\nAnother protein called tau also accumulates and forms tangles in the brain.\n\nAs this happens, the brain's nerve cells die and the brain actually shrinks in size.\n\nThe most commonly recognized early symptom is a memory problem, said Jennifer Lepard, the president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association Greater Michigan Chapter, but the disease doesn't always initially present that way.\n\n\"Before memory loss, it can even be what we would call an effect on your executive functioning, so it’s your ability to process information, make good decisions on complicated factors, planning,\" she said. \"One of the best examples of that is sometimes people begin to have trouble with finances. People who have always paid the bills, run the household budget, all of a sudden can't.\n\n\"One of the reasons it's not always easy to see the memory issues up front is it’s not always the earliest and most prevalent sign, but also because people that have what are called high cognitive reserves – people who have a lot of education, who maybe had done very demanding jobs in the past and really utilized their brain a lot – are sometimes very good at hiding symptoms and overcompensating. A lot of times, they know they’re having some memory issues and some problems, but they are pretty good at making sure that you don’t see it.\"\n\nAs the disease progresses, there can be confusion about time and place, difficulty speaking and writing, poor judgment, changes in mood and personality, aggression and agitation and being unable to recognize loved ones, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Eventually, people lose the ability to speak, walk, sit and even to swallow.\n\n\"Anyone with a brain, when they get older, is at risk of developing Alzheimer’s,\" Lepard said. \"There are a number of people that think, 'Well, it wasn’t in my family, so I’m sure I don’t have it.' And that is not the case.\"\n\nAlthough the majority of people who get Alzheimer's disease are 65 and older, Feldman said it's also important to understand that Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging, and it does also sometimes occur in younger people. About 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, she said.\n\n\"Other risk factors include your family history (especially if a first-degree relative has had Alzheimer's disease), type 2 diabetes and obesity, high blood pressure, previous brain trauma, and your APOE-e4 status – this is the first risk gene identified and remains the gene with strongest impact on risk,\" Feldman said.\n\nWomen, too, are at greater risk. As are people of African American and Latino descent.\n\nAlzheimer's costly toll\n\nThe average person with Alzheimer's disease will live four to eight years after diagnosis, said Lepard, and about 40% of that time, the person will be in the most severe form of the disease, which requires around-the-clock care.\n\n\"So, if you take a person who lives eight years after diagnosis, for three of those years, that person will be in the most severe aspects of the disease and will need 24-hour care and have lost most of their ability to keep up with the activities required in daily living,\" Lepard said.\n\nThe intensity of care that people need when the disease has progressed that far is often beyond what their loved ones can handle, she said. Plus, families quickly see how expensive long-term care can be. The average cost to Medicare for a single person with dementia in 2018 was $27,244, according to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nCaring for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia will cost $290 billion this year alone. But by 2050, that cost is expected to rise to $1.1 trillion annually. It's the most expensive disease in America – with care costing more than cancer and heart disease, the Alzheimer's Association reports.\n\n\"We really see this bankrupting Medicare at some point,\" Lepard said. \"When we talk to members of Congress about the situation and why we need to invest in more research, it's because people cannot afford long-term care.\n\n\"Many people, until they are in the situation of needing long-term care, really don’t understand how it’s funded. They think well, if I have Medicare, I’m sure it’s going to cover it all. That’s not really how long-term care is paid for.\"\n\nThe cost goes far beyond dollars and cents, Feldman said.\n\n\"That’s a drain like you can’t imagine,\" she said. \"There’s an economic drain, a drain on those individuals’ ability to work and be productive in society, a medical drain in terms of the cost to take care of the patient. But then, in my mind having lived it – and it’s not quantifiable necessarily in terms of dollars – is the emotional toll that it takes not only on the patient but on the family.\n\n\"I saw whole families fall apart in that memory care unit. I saw other families come closer together. I think most families … take care of their loved one absolutely as long as they can ... because you see the essential spirit and essence of the person, but they’re missing that one piece, the memory.\n\n\"It is the loss, really, of the person that you know right in front of your eyes, and to see what that did to wives and husbands was eye-opening to me. It is cruel, and it is very, very difficult as the primary family member to lose the person you know.\"\n\nRising numbers, more research dollars needed\n\nAlthough the number of Americans with the disease is rising, Alzheimer's true toll still may be underestimated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that often when people with Alzheimer's disease die, the cause of death listed on their death certificates may be pneumonia, heart attack or stroke; it sometimes isn't noted that the patient also had Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"It was very common – it’s getting better now – that someone would be in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and their body is not functioning,\" Lepard said. \"They would develop pneumonia and die. Did they die because they developed pneumonia or did they die because they had Alzheimer’s? Our argument is that they are dying because they had Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\"More and more, it is being put on death certificates if not as the main cause, it might be listed as pneumonia as a result of Alzheimer’s disease. We are pushing ... for that,\" she said, because it creates a more accurate picture of just how huge its reach truly is.\"\n\nWithout an accurate idea of the scope of the problem, health officials and public policy makers are less likely to give it the attention and research dollars needed to find new and better treatments, she said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health allocated $2.3 billion for Alzheimer's disease research this year, which is up significantly from the $500 million that was awarded six years ago.\n\n\"That sounds like a tremendous amount of money, but it is still much less than NIH spends on AIDS, heart disease or cancer,\" Lepard said. \"Of course, we do not want less to be spent on those diseases, but we do believe that so much progress has been made on those diseases because they have been investing the research money to do it. That’s our biggest ask.\"\n\nAlthough some treatments can help people with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease in the short-term, no treatments have yet been discovered that are effective long-term in stopping brain degeneration or reversing memory loss. There is no cure for the disease.\n\n\"Just like every disorder, the more we can understand, the more awareness, and the more governmental input we can have and research dollars,\" Feldman said. \"There are so many unanswered questions and we really do need to continually do active research in this area and try to develop therapeutics.\"\n\nAmong them, Feldman said, is whether the disease could be treated earlier – before symptoms develop – with lifestyle changes, immunotherapy or a vaccine.\n\nThe scientists in Feldman's lab are working to develop a breakthrough treatment using enhanced lines of human neural stem cells to reduce the buildup of amyloid plaques to improve memory and learning deficits.\n\n\"We recently received a grant from the National Institute on Aging to determine exactly how these stem cells impact (Alzheimer's disease) and improve memory,\" she said.\n\nShe is fascinated, too, by the power of music to stir remembrances in people who have Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"My mother was born and raised in Italy, and toward the end, she wasn’t really speaking a great deal,\" Feldman said. She’d speak to me and have conversations, but she was definitely declining.\"\n\nOne evening, Feldman recalled taking her mother to a sing-along at the assisted living center. A musician sang many old-fashioned, well-known songs like \"A Bicycle Built for Two.\"\n\n\"Since my mom didn’t grow up here as much in her early life, she didn’t know some of the songs the other residents knew,\" she said. But then, \"the guy started singing a song in Italian. My mom’s eyes lit up, and she sang the entire song with him. And I looked at her, and she gave me a big smile, and then she kind of went back\" into herself, and the memory faded once again.\n\n\"I saw that many times with music among the other residents. ... So, you know, it’s very interesting how music activates the mind. There are still parts of the brain that are working, and a lot of them still have their essential personalities.

It is the most common metal and makes up 8% of the Earth’s mass. Because of this, aluminum is literally everywhere, including drinking water and food. Some foods, like citrus fruits, have more aluminum than others.\n\nNaturally occurring aluminum is rarely encountered in its metallic, elemental form. Typically, aluminum is found in the environment as aluminum salts or other compounds such as aluminum citrate. This material circulates through the environment and food web. Adults naturally have between 30-50 milligrams of aluminum in their body at any given time.\n\n\"Analytical chemistry is sufficiently sensitive now that I'm not aware of anything that, naturally, in our environment, food, water and everything else, where it cannot be detected,\" said Dr. Robert Yokel, a professor of toxicology at the University of Kentucky who studies aluminum.\n\nAluminum is not a nutrient. In food additives, aluminum compounds are used as preservatives, for color or for leavening breads without active yeast. A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration confirmed by email that the agency considers it safe for use in food, food preparation and medicines.\n\nUSA TODAY was unable to contact the author or website operators for comment. The article hosted on “natural-beauty-secrets.com” does not list an author. The “Contact Us” form hosted on the website does not work in several different browsers. The website is hosted through an anonymous domain registration service that did not respond to our request for contact information for the website operators.\n\nNo effects in healthy adults, research shows\n\nWhile it is true that some aluminum gets into food when cooked in aluminum foil or with aluminum cookware, and that this is enhanced in acidic foods, it is not true this causes any health effects in healthy adults.\n\nYour body absorbs less than 1% of the background aluminum in food or drinking water. Ninety-five percent of this is cleared by the kidneys. Most of the environmental aluminum you are exposed to passes out of your system within 24 hours. The average adult eats roughly 7-9 milligrams of aluminum per day. This amount can vary based on local environmental conditions or diet or cookware. Neither the FDA nor the European Food Safety Authority have found that this exposure is high enough to cause problems in healthy adults.\n\n\"If one goes to a high enough concentration, basically of anything, one can produce toxic effects.\" Yokel said. \"The dose makes the poison.\"\n\nIt is true that aluminum exposure has been linked to dementia, impaired neural function and lung irritation, but this is never caused by routine, dietary exposure.\n\nAluminum-linked neural issues\n\nAluminum-linked dementia and encephalopathy been found in elderly people with impaired kidney function. Sometimes, this has happened when dialysis fluid was contaminated by aluminum. When the kidneys don’t work, dietary aluminum can build up in the body and cause dementia. Dialysis is supposed to remove things a failing kidney cannot, so if dialysis fluid is contaminated by aluminum then this happens faster.\n\n\"Everyone would agree that aluminum is a potential neurotoxin but this is an extreme situation,\" Yokel said.\n\nThe other cases where aluminum can cause neural problems are more rare, such as when workers are exposed to chronic, low-to-high doses of aluminum dust or fumes in places like aluminum plants or mines. Other documented cases of aluminum neural toxicity come from embedded aluminum shrapnel.\n\nAluminum has at times been linked to Alzheimer’s and Austism spectrum disorder, but in neither case has there been definitive evidence that aluminum causes either. While some studies have shown elevated aluminum levels in Alzheimer’s patients, others have not. It’s not clear what role aluminum plays in Alzheimer’s or whether it is playing a direct role at all.\n\n\"There are no studies that have actually confirmed that there is a correlation,\" said Betsy Reed, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nReed said that while early research made such links, later studies were unable to establish the connection. The Alzheimer's Association considers the connection between Alzheimer’s and aluminum to be a myth. A representative of the Autism Self Advocacy Network said something similar. Aluminum is a common component of vaccines. The origins of the connection between autism and aluminum came from the pseudoscientific antivaxxer movement.\n\n\"At this point, any argument that vaccines cause autism, no matter the specific causal mechanism they propose is going against the science,\" Zoe Gross, a spokeswoman for Autism Self Advocacy Network, said in an email. \"It reflects our society's fear of autism and of autistic people — the idea that we must have been harmed in some way to be the way we are.\"\n\nSimilarly, while aluminum has been linked to Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis, the role it plays is unclear. There is no scientific evidence for whether aluminum causes these disorders.\n\nAluminum doesn't cause cancer\n\nThe cancer claims made by the article are also false. Aluminum has never been demonstrated to have a role in cancer. Aluminum smelter workers do have a higher risk of cancer, but this is due to exposure to other chemicals, not aluminum. Aluminum is frequently the target of breast cancer scares because of its use in antiperspirant. Studies have shown that aluminum doesn’t get absorbed through skin and no studies have found a link between aluminum and cancer.\n\n\"It's generally concluded that there is not good evidence aluminum causes cancer,\" Yokel said.\n\nWhile it is true that aluminum is highly concentrated in cigarette smoke and that aluminum absorbs more easily through lung tissue, aluminum is low down the list of harmful substances in cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke contains an array of highly cancer-causing chemicals and toxic heavy metals more toxic than aluminum. Smoke particles, on their own, are considered carcinogenic by the American Cancer Society.\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nThe claim that aluminum leaches into food due to heat and causes Alzheimer’s, autism, dementia and cancer is rated PARTLY FALSE based on our research. While it is true that food and water often contain aluminum and that aluminum levels in food increase in hot or acidic conditions, it is false that such exposure is linked to any health effects in healthy adults. While it is true that aluminum can be an occupational health risk or among people with impaired kidney function, it is not true that routine exposure will cause the health effects listed in the article, such as cancer.\n\nOur sources\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Invasive and expensive brain scans and spinal taps that measure spinal fluid are used, but insurance does not always cover those tests.\n\nResearchers reported the blood test measuring the protein tau accurately distinguished Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia in 89% to 98% of cases.\n\n\"It is a promising blood test that seems to be highly accurate and seems to detect (Alzheimer's) relatively early,\" said Dr. Eric Reiman, a researcher in one of the studies and executive director of Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix\n\nBut experts warned it could take a few years to validate a blood test as a reliable option for both doctors and researchers. And would patients want to know they are destined to develop memory and thinking problems if there are no reliable medications to slow the deadly disease?\n\nRandall J. Bateman, a Washington University neurology professor and Alzheimer's researcher, said blood tests could be useful both for patients and doctors as well scientists studying new drugs to slow the mind-robbing disease.\n\nDoctors might use the test to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and begin treatments with existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that ease symptoms, if not mental decline.\n\nBut perhaps the bigger payoff would come for accelerating research for new drugs that seek to slow or halt a disease that afflicts 5.8 million older Americans. Drug companies for decades have developed therapies targeting amyloid proteins on the theory it is responsible for scuttling memory and thinking in Alzheimer's patients. Some recent studies have sought to administer drugs targeting these proteins before memory and thinking problems emerge.\n\nBateman said such blood tests that detect Alzheimer's before symptoms emerge \"is going to be transformational\" for studies that attempt to halt or slow the disease.\n\n\"If we can prevent those symptoms from coming on, that’s the reason we’re so excited by these kinds of biomarkers,\" he said. \"And we think in the right combination, these blood biomarkers will also tell us about when someone will become sick. That’s going to be very useful in the clinic when we triage these patients .\"\n\nDr. Oskar Hansson of Lund University in Sweden led a study of Eli Lilly’s test measuring the tau protein on more than 1,400 people already enrolled in dementia studies in Sweden, Arizona and Colombia. They included people with no impairment, mild impairment, Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases.\n\nThe p-tau217 test outperformed a host of other measures for indicating which patients had Alzheimer’s as verified by brain scans. It also was comparable to the brain scans and some spinal tests in accuracy.\n\nThe Arizona portion of the study included 81 people who had donated their brains upon death, so researchers were able to show that blood testing while they were alive closely matched evidence of disease later.\n\nThe Colombia part of the study included people with a rare genetic mutation that guarantees they will develop Alzheimer’s at a young age, typically in their 40s. In those with the gene, p-tau217 blood levels started to rise “around 20 years before symptoms,” Hansson said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/health/reverse-aging-life-itself-scn-wellness/index.html", "title": "The 'Benjamin Button' effect: Scientists can reverse aging in mice ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn molecular biologist David Sinclair’s lab at Harvard Medical School, old mice are growing young again.\n\nUsing proteins that can turn an adult cell into a stem cell, Sinclair and his team have reset aging cells in mice to earlier versions of themselves. In his team’s first breakthrough, published in late 2020, old mice with poor eyesight and damaged retinas could suddenly see again, with vision that at times rivaled their offspring’s.\n\nDavid Sinclair has reversed aging in mice and believes the same can be done for people. Courtesy Richard Groleau\n\n“It’s a permanent reset, as far as we can tell, and we think it may be a universal process that could be applied across the body to reset our age,” said Sinclair, who has spent the last 20 years studying ways to reverse the ravages of time.\n\n“If we reverse aging, these diseases should not happen. We have the technology today to be able to go into your hundreds without worrying about getting cancer in your 70s, heart disease in your 80s and Alzheimer’s in your 90s.” Sinclair told an audience at Life Itself, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“This is the world that is coming. It’s literally a question of when and for most of us, it’s going to happen in our lifetimes,” Sinclair told the audience.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Can we cure aging? 04:31 - Source: CNN\n\n“His research shows you can change aging to make lives younger for longer. Now he wants to change the world and make aging a disease,” said Whitney Casey, an investor who is partnering with Sinclair to create a do-it-yourself biological age test.\n\nWhile modern medicine addresses sickness, it doesn’t address the underlying cause, “which for most diseases, is aging itself,” Sinclair said. “We know that when we reverse the age of an organ like the brain in a mouse, the diseases of aging then go away. Memory comes back; there is no more dementia.\n\n“I believe that in the future, delaying and reversing aging will be the best way to treat the diseases that plague most of us.”\n\nA reset button\n\nIn Sinclair’s lab, two mice sit side by side. One is the picture of youth, the other gray and feeble. Yet they are brother and sister, born from the same litter – only one has been genetically altered to age faster.\n\nIf that could be done, Sinclair asked his team, could the reverse be accomplished as well? Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka had already reprogrammed human adult skin cells to behave like embryonic or pluripotent stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his “induced pluripotent stem cells,” soon became known as “Yamanaka factors.”\n\nHowever, adult cells fully switched back to stem cells via Yamanaka factors lose their identity. They forget they are blood, heart and skin cells, making them perfect for rebirth as “cell du jour,” but lousy at rejuvenation. You don’t want Brad Pitt in “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” to become a baby all at once; you want him to age backward while still remembering who he is.\n\nLabs around the world jumped on the problem. A study published in 2016 by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, showed signs of aging could be expunged in genetically aged mice, exposed for a short time to four main Yamanaka factors, without erasing the cells’ identity.\n\nBut there was a downside in all this research: In certain situations, the altered mice developed cancerous tumors.\n\nLooking for a safer alternative, Sinclair lab geneticist Yuancheng Lu chose three of the four factors and genetically added them to a harmless virus. The virus was designed to deliver the rejuvenating Yamanaka factors to damaged retinal ganglion cells at the back of an aged mouse’s eye. After injecting the virus into the eye, the pluripotent genes were then switched on by feeding the mouse an antibiotic.\n\n“The antibiotic is just a tool. It could be any chemical really, just a way to be sure the three genes are switched on,” Sinclair said. “Normally they are only on in very young developing embryos and then turn off as we age.”\n\nAmazingly, damaged neurons in the eyes of mice injected with the three cells rejuvenated, even growing new axons, or projections from the eye into the brain. Since that original study, Sinclair said his lab has reversed aging in the muscles and brains of mice and is now working on rejuvenating a mouse’s entire body.\n\n“Somehow the cells know the body can reset itself, and they still know which genes should be on when they were young,” Sinclair said. “We think we’re tapping into an ancient regeneration system that some animals use – when you cut the limb off a salamander, it regrows the limb. The tail of a fish will grow back; a finger of a mouse will grow back.”\n\nThat discovery indicates there is a “backup copy” of youthfulness information stored in the body, he added.\n\n“I call it the information theory of aging,” he said. “It’s a loss of information that drives aging cells to forget how to function, to forget what type of cell they are. And now we can tap into a reset switch that restores the cell’s ability to read the genome correctly again, as if it was young.”\n\nWhile the changes have lasted for months in mice, renewed cells don’t freeze in time and never age (like, say, vampires or superheroes), Sinclair said. “It’s as permanent as aging is. It’s a reset, and then we see the mice age out again, so then we just repeat the process.\n\n“We believe we have found the master control switch, a way to rewind the clock,” he added. “The body will then wake up, remember how to behave, remember how to regenerate and will be young again, even if you’re already old and have an illness.”\n\nScience already knows how to slow human aging\n\nStudies on whether the genetic intervention that revitalized mice will do the same for people are in early stages, Sinclair said. It will be years before human trials are finished, analyzed and, if safe and successful, scaled to the mass needed for a federal stamp of approval.\n\nWhile we wait for science to determine if we too can reset our genes, there are many other ways to slow the aging process and reset our biological clocks, Sinclair said.\n\n“The top tips are simply: Focus on plants for food, eat less often, get sufficient sleep, lose your breath for 10 minutes three times a week by exercising to maintain your muscle mass, don’t sweat the small stuff and have a good social group,” Sinclair said.\n\nAll these behaviors affect our epigenome, proteins and chemicals that sit like freckles on each gene, waiting to tell the gene “what to do, where to do it, and when to do it,” according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. The epigenome literally turns genes on and off.\n\nWhat controls the epigenome? Human behavior and one’s environment play a key role. Let’s say you were born with a genetic predisposition for heart disease and diabetes. But because you exercised, ate a plant-focused diet, slept well and managed your stress during most of your life, it’s possible those genes would never be activated. That, experts say, is how we can take some of our genetic fate into our own hands.\n\nThe positive impact on our health from eating a plant-based diet, having close, loving relationships and getting adequate exercise and sleep are well documented. Calorie restriction, however, is a more controversial way of adding years to life, experts say.\n\nCutting back on food – without inducing malnutrition – has been a scientifically known way to lengthen life for nearly a century. Studies on worms, crabs, snails, fruit flies and rodents have found restricting calories “delay the onset of age-related disorders” such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, according to the National Institute on Aging. Some studies have also found extensions in life span: In a 1986 study, mice fed only a third of a typical day’s calories lived to 53 months – a mouse kept as a pet may live to about 24 months.\n\nStudies in people, however, have been less enlightening, partly because many have focused on weight loss instead of longevity. For Sinclair, however, cutting back on meals was a significant factor in resetting his personal clock: Recent tests show he has a biological age of 42 in a body born 53 years ago.\n\n“I’ve been doing a biological test for 10 years now, and I’ve been getting steadily younger for the last decade,” Sinclair said. “The biggest change in my biological clock occurred when I ate less often – I only eat one meal a day now. That made the biggest difference to my biochemistry.”\n\nAdditional ways to turn back the clock\n\nSinclair incorporates other tools into his life, based on research from his lab and others. In his book “Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don’t Have To,” he writes that little of what he does has undergone the sort of “rigorous long-term clinical testing” needed to have a “complete understanding of the wide range of potential outcomes.” In fact, he added, “I have no idea if this is even the right thing for me to be doing.”\n\nWith that caveat, Sinclair is willing to share his tips: He keeps his starches and sugars to a minimum and gave up desserts at age 40 (although he does admit to stealing a taste on occasion). He eats a good amount of plants, avoids eating other mammals and keeps his body weight at the low end of optimal.\n\nHe exercises by taking a lot of steps each day, walks upstairs instead of taking an elevator and visits the gym with his son to lift weights and jog before taking a sauna and a dip in an ice-cold pool. “I’ve got my 20-year-old body back,” he said with a smile.\n\nSpeaking of cold, science has long thought lower temperatures increased longevity in many species, but whether it is true or not may come down to one’s genome, according to a 2018 study. Regardless, it appears cold can increase brown fat in humans, which is the type of fat bears use to stay warm during hibernation. Brown fat has been shown to improve metabolism and combat obesity.\n\nSinclair takes vitamins D and K2 and baby aspirin daily, along with supplements that have shown promise in extending longevity in yeast, mice and human cells in test tubes.\n\nOne supplement he takes after discovering its benefits is 1 gram of resveratrol, the antioxidant-like substance found in the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries and peanuts.\n\nHe also takes 1 gram of metformin, a staple in the arsenal of drugs used to lower blood sugars in people with diabetes. He added it after studies showed it might reduce inflammation, oxidative damage and cellular senescence, in which cells are damaged but refuse to die, remaining in the body as a type of malfunctioning “zombie cell.”\n\nHowever, some scientists quibble about the use of metformin, pointing to rare cases of lactic acid buildup and a lack of knowledge on how it functions in the body.\n\nSinclair also takes 1 gram of NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, which in the body turns into NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. A coenzyme that exists in all living cells, NAD+ plays a central role in the body’s biological processes, such as regulating cellular energy, increasing insulin sensitivity and reversing mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nWhen the body ages, NAD+ levels significantly decrease, dropping by middle age to about half the levels of youth, contributing to age-related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Numerous studies have shown restoring NAD+ levels safely improves overall health and increases life span in yeast, mice and dogs. Clinical trials testing the molecule in humans have been underway for three years, Sinclair said.\n\n“These supplements, and the lifestyle that I am doing, is designed to turn on our defenses against aging,” he said. “Now, if you do that, you don’t necessarily turn back the clock. These are just things that slow down epigenetic damage and these other horrible hallmarks of aging.\n\n“But the real advance, in my view, was the ability to just tell the body, ‘Forget all that. Just be young again,’ by just flipping a switch. Now I’m not saying that we’re going to all be 20 years old again,” Sinclair said.\n\n“But I’m optimistic that we can duplicate this very fundamental process that exists in everything from a bat to a sheep to a whale to a human. We’ve done it in a mouse. There’s no reason I can think of why it shouldn’t work in a person, too.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/960737/donanemab-and-seven-other-breakthroughs-for-alzheimers-and-dementia-in", "title": "The latest breakthroughs for Alzheimer's and dementia | The Week", "text": "The world of Alzheimer's treatment is at an inflection point as more potential drugs make their way out of clinical trials.

The effects of the drug are similar to those of lecanemab, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023.\n\nIn February, the BBC's \"Panorama\" broadcast an episode on lecanemab and donanemab under the title \"Alzheimer's: A Turning Point?\". Consultant neurologist Dr Cath Mummery, head of clinical trials at the Dementia Research Centre at University College London, told the programme that although the effects of these drugs are modest – they appear to slow cognitive decline by between about a quarter and a third over 18 months – this would make a meaningful difference to individual patients, giving them \"about five months at a higher function\".\n\nYet despite the hype, in March the FDA announced it had delayed its decision, and instructed an independent panel to further scrutinise data on the safety and efficacy of donanemab.\n\nDr Timothy Daly, a dementia researcher with Sorbonne University in Paris, said this was no surprise as \"the benefits of donanemab, and similar, much-hyped drugs, including aducanumab and lecanemab, have proved harder to quantify than their potential harms\", The Guardian reported.\n\nBlood test breakthrough\n\nIn two concurrent studies University College London and the University of Oxford are set to conduct UK-wide clinical trials to identify blood tests which will help diagnose dementia earlier.\n\nAccording to NHS England, fewer than two-thirds of people in England with dementia have a formal diagnosis. It is hoped this research could lead to easy-to-administer blood tests for diagnosing Alzheimer’s to be available on the NHS within five years.\n\n\"Timely and accurate diagnosis of the diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, is crucial, as it means people can access vital care and support and take part in medical research\" said Alzheimer's Research UK.\n\nThis will be \"even more imperative if new treatments such as lecanemab and donanemab are approved for use in the NHS, as these work best for people in the earliest stage of their disease\", said the charity.\n\nFirst oral drug\n\nTraditionally, amyloid-targeting therapies require regular intravenous infusions that take place at a clinic or hospital, but now scientists are developing amyloid-fighting medications in an \"easily accessible pill form\", reported Bright Focus.\n\nThe first disease-modifying oral medication for Alzheimer's, ALZ-801, is expected to be submitted for approval to the FDA later this year following a Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nALZ-801 targets a form of amyloid that builds up in the brain and can negatively affect surrounding cells. Trial results reported so far show less risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities than similar intravenous medications such as donanemab, while the oral form of the drug \"also holds the potential for easier treatment access and less burden to people receiving the medication\", said Bright Focus.\n\nA 'revolutionary' jab\n\nThe Daily Express reported in March that a \"revolutionary jab, which is designed to remove toxic proteins from the brain before they cause the damage leading to the most common form of dementia\" is being trialled on patients in the early stages of the disease.\n\nThe drug, known as ACI-24, \"stimulates the body's immune system\" to target toxic amyloid proteins and clear them from the brain, \"in much the same way as the Covid jab supercharges our body's natural protections\", said the paper.\n\nClinical trials of the vaccine are being carried out in five centres across the UK, including at Oxford and Cambridge, as well as in Europe and the US, with the results to be presented at a conference in Philadelphia in July.\n\nScientists are hailing the jab, which would be administered five times over the course of a year, as potentially a \"massive breakthrough\" with hopes it could be widely available within five years.\n\nOther treatments\n\nRecent studies have also shown potential benefits from gene therapy and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the use of sleeping pills to lower levels of amyloid beta protein in the brain, and how hearing aids for middle-aged adults suffering hearing loss could reduce their risk of dementia.\n\nMaintaining a Mediterranean diet – rich in whole grains, nuts, fish, vegetables and fruit – could also reduce the risk of dementia, according to the journal BMC Medicine, as could taking vitamin D, research from the University of Exeter suggested.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Adrienne Wyper", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/09"}]}

OLSEN\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Sweden's left-leaning government instituted a military draft for both men and women Thursday because of what its defense minister called a deteriorating security environment in Europe and around Sweden.\n\nSweden abolished compulsory military service for men in 2010 because there were enough volunteers to meet its military needs. It has never had a military draft for women.\n\nThe government said \"the all-volunteer recruitment hasn't provided the Armed Forces with enough trained personnel. The re-activating of conscription is needed for military readiness.\"\n\nIn September, non-NATO-member Sweden stationed permanent troops on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland. Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist described the move as sending a signal after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its \"increasing pressure\" on the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nThere have also been reports of airspace violations by Russia's military aircraft in the Baltics and a military buildup in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, which sits across the Baltic Sea from Sweden.\n\nAbout 20,000 people now work for the Swedish armed forces, 84 percent of them men and 16 percent women, according to the forces' website. But the armed forces lack 1,000 active troops as well as 7,000 reservists, according to Sweden's coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens.\n\nUnder the plan approved Thursday, at least 4,000 18-year-olds could be called up each year. Swedes will still be able to volunteer for military service.\n\nThe Swedish government, which often has described itself as \"feminist,\" said \"modern conscription is gender neutral and will include both women and men.\"\n\nHultqvist said he had been inspired by neighboring Norway, which in 2013 introduced a law applying military conscription to both sexes. That made Norway the first NATO member to draft both men and women, joining a tiny group of countries around the world, including Israel.\n\nConscription was introduced in Sweden in 1901, but had gradually wound down and was formally canceled 109 years later. During the Cold War era, nearly 85 percent of Swedish men were drafted into the army due to the nearby threat of the Soviet Union. The average term of service was around 11 months.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden's military expenditure dropped to 1.1 percent of its gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in 1991 as the Cold War came to an end, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nOn Tuesday, Micael Byden, head of Sweden's armed forces, said an additional 6.5 billion kronor ($718 million), or a 15 percent budget boost, was needed to increase the country's military's capabilities in the coming years.

And, in my opinion, the harsh reaction we are seeing in society is deserved,” Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia’s Federation Council, said in a post on Telegram.\n\nIn a direct address to Russia’s regional governors, Matviyenko said they were “fully responsible for carrying out mobilization campaigns” in “full and absolute compliance with the announced criteria.”\n\nVyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, echoed Matviyenko’s calls for due diligence, adding, “If a mistake is made, it must be corrected.”\n\nMeanwhile, videos circulating on Russian social media appear to reveal the tensions, sadness and confusion that the draft – which began after a Wednesday announcement – has sparked, with scenes of families saying emotional goodbyes and others of recruits arguing about being called up.\n\nOne video from Friday appears to show police and National Guard memcbers engaged in scuffles with a crowd, as drafted men board a bus in the Omsk region of Russia’s Siberia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday significantly raised the stakes of his assault on Ukraine for ordinary Russians, with the announcement of an immediate “partial mobilization” in a bid to reinforce his faltering invasion following Ukrainian gains.\n\nThe mobilization would only affect Russians with previous military experience, according to Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said 300,000 reservists would be called up. However, the decree itself gives much broader terms, sowing fears among Russians of a wider draft in the future.\n\nActivist groups, such as Free Buryatia Foundation, have said ethnic minorities in Russia are being disproportionately mobilized. CNN has geolocated videos of some of these men being mobilized in Russia’s Far East regions.\n\nResistance ‘will grow’\n\nThe mobilization announcement sparked anti-war demonstrations across the country, which were swiftly cracked down on by police. At least 1,472 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities across Russia as of Saturday, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info.\n\nIt’s also sparked an exodus from Russia as military-age men flee the country rather than risk being conscripted, with video footage showing long lines of traffic at land border crossings into several neighboring countries and surging airfares and sold out flights in recent days.\n\nA Finnish border guard officer stands near cars queuing to enter Finland from Russia in Vaalimaa, Finland, on Friday September 23, 2022.

This follows the introduction of amendments by the State Duma on Tuesday.\n\nUnder the new rules, Russians who abandon or fail to report for military duty could be subject to up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“The federal law also introduces criminal liability for military personnel for voluntary surrender, as well as criminal liability for looting during martial law, in wartime or in conditions of armed conflict or combat operations,” reads a statement by the Kremlin about the amendments.\n\nNew Russian conscripts receive combat weapons in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia on Sept 23.

Putin last week said he would use “all the means at our disposal,” if he deemed the “territorial integrity” of Russia to be jeopardized.\n\nOverall, turnout on the first day of voting in referendums in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics and the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions exceeded 15%, claimed Alexander Kholodov, deputy chairman of the Russian state monitoring body, the Commission on Security and Interaction part of the Public Supervisory Commission, according to RIA Novosti.\n\nUkraine has requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on Russia’s “sham” referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Oleg Nikolenko.\n\n“Russia must be held accountable for its further attempts to change Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders in a violation of the UN Charter,” Nikolenko said in a tweet Saturday.", "authors": ["Katharina Krebs Radina Gigova Simone Mccarthy Sana Noor Haq", "Katharina Krebs", "Radina Gigova", "Simone Mccarthy", "Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/24/russia-protests-putin-war-ukraine/8084427001/", "title": "At anti-war protests in Russia, fears for the drafted as 'cannon fodder ...", "text": "Anna Nemtsova and Michael Collins\n\nOlga Zhgun couldn’t stay silent.\n\nZhgun, a 45-year-old film director, marched through the streets of Moscow with other anti-war protesters Wednesday night, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to mobilize another 300,000 reservists to bolster his troops fighting in Ukraine.\n\nBefore the night was over, Zghun would end up in the back of a police truck, bleeding, after a police officer smashed her head with a club.\n\n“When Putin called for the mobilization, I knew I could not stay indifferent,” Zhgun said. “It was a turning point.

Arkady Budnitsky/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThere are widespread complaints about incompetent or non-existent leadership.\n\nRussian military bloggers – some of whom have hundreds of thousands of followers – have been bitterly critical of senior officers.\n\n“Do we have generals capable of replacing those who have been sacked? Does anyone know one? I don’t,” asked Vladen Tatarskiy, who has more than half-a-million subscribers. “One idiot is rotated for another. One fails, another fails, the third seems more harmless.”\n\nIn a bold note of dissent, soldiers of the 155th Brigade of the Russian Pacific Fleet Marines wrote to their regional governor saying they’d been thrown into an “incomprehensible battle” in the Donetsk region.\n\n“As a result of the ‘carefully’ planned offensive by the ‘great commanders’, we lost about 300 men, dead and wounded, with some MIA over the past 4 days,” the letter said. It was published by a Russian military blogger and widely circulated.\n\nOne prominent military blogger claimed the 155th and another unit “lost twice as many men in Pavlivka” – in Donetsk region – “as during the two Chechnya wars.”\n\nIn a rare acknowledgment of criticism, the Russian Defense Ministry retorted that losses did “not exceed 1% of the combat strength and 7% of the wounded, a significant part of whom have already returned to duty.”\n\nBut the reported debacle around Pavlivka is not an isolated incident.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, who tracks the Russian military at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, says: “We have seen many complaints about unprepared mobilized men who were committed to the Svatove-Kreminna frontline [in Luhansk], which is currently one of the combat-heavy positions for Russian forces.”\n\nProtests back home\n\nAs soldiers relay their plight back home, their complaints are being amplified by wives and mothers through social media and in direct appeals to regional authorities.\n\nStepanenko says the “most common complaints from these families are lack of information from the Ministry of Defense on the whereabouts of their loved ones, delayed payments, and lack of supplies.”\n\nLast week, video emerged from TV Rain, a Russian media outlet that now operates in exile, of servicemen’s relatives gathered at a military base in the city of Boguchar in Voronezh region, many complaining that they’d not heard from husbands or sons since early October.\n\nIn another video posted on the social network vk.com on Monday, a group of women in Voronezh said their husbands and sons were on the front line without commanders, without water, necessary clothing or weapons.\n\nOne woman, Lyudmila Agarkova, said her son had told her that very few of his battalion had survived. “They literally crawled out from under the corpses,” she said.\n\nAppealing to the governor of Voronezh for help, the women say their men “were not trained, they were taken to the firing range just once, they had no combat experience.”\n\nThey also complain that they can’t get answers, with one saying: “We are a few minutes away from the military commissariat. None of the staff ever gets in touch, they completely ignore us.”\n\nA Russian serviceman addresses reservists at a gathering point in the town of Volzhsky in the Volgograd region, Russia, on September 28. Stringer/Reuters\n\nA video posted on YouTube shows a dozen women reportedly from Sverdlovsk region, some with young children, appealing for help for recruits from the 55th brigade reportedly hiding out near Svatove in Luhansk. The families say their men have been threatened with military tribunals but argue they should not have been on the front line at all.\n\nOne woman says her son had called, saying they were “left without any command, without ammunition, hungry and cold, they are all ill.”\n\n“They ended up there without any professional training,” says another woman, whose 41-year old husband was mobilized.\n\n“They don’t get paid. They are not assigned to any military unit. Where to look for them, whom to ask, we don’t know.”\n\nOccasionally, local authorities do respond. The military commissar of the Vladimir region, Yuri Gusarov, responded to relatives who said their men “were sent to the front near Svatove without proper equipment and training.”\n\n“Our military units have weapons, body armor, clothes, water, hot meals. Deliveries of aid from the Vladimir region are regular, communication with the commanders is maintained,” the military commissar replied.\n\nMore often than not, the families don’t get a response.\n\nJournalist Anastasia Kashevarova, whose Telegram channel has more than 200,000 subscribers, said she’d received hundreds of messages from relatives of fighters. “Groups are abandoned without communication, without the necessary weapons, without medicines, naturally without artillery. No one knows who is on their right, who is on the left, who is in the rear,” she posted.\n\n“Instead of being listened to, they are threatened with punishment, a tribunal, and sent back to the front line with four magazines of ammunition and a grenade launcher with a few shots.”\n\nCNN reached out to relatives of men in the 55th brigade from Tomsk and confirmed that they had met the local military command. But a day later, one woman texted: “Apologies, but our lips have been sealed.”\n\nA volunteer uses his mobile phone as he sits on the top of a destroyed Russian armoured vehicle in the recently liberated town of Izium, in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, on September 27, 2022. Zohra Bensemra/Reuters\n\nThe moderator of one Telegram channel for families told CNN that mothers and wives often fear “repressive retribution” against their loved ones if they speak out. The moderator, who CNN is not identifying for their safety, said that at the local level “some authorities are already calling them ‘deserters,’ without investigating why they were sent to Ukraine without training, equipment or command on the front line.”\n\nBut complaining can come at a price. Olga Kuznetsova, a resident of Arkhangelsk, was found guilty of “discrediting the Russian Armed Forces” after collecting signatures against mobilization. She was fined 15,000 rubles ($250).\n\nTraining deficit\n\nWestern officials say the Russian war machine is struggling to assimilate tens of thousands of largely inexperienced recruits.\n\nThe UK’s Ministry of Defense said last week that “Russia is probably struggling to provide military training for its current mobilization drive and its annual autumn conscription intake. Newly mobilized conscripts likely have minimal training or no training at all. Experienced officers and trainers have been deployed to fight in Ukraine and some have likely been killed in the conflict.”\n\nUkrainian intelligence has reported that the Russian military is speeding up the graduations of cadets but Stepanenko says that “while these cadets may be more familiar with military craft, it’s hard to say how effective they will be in combat.”\n\nUkrainian officials acknowledge that Russia’s mobilization has put more men into battle, pulling Ukrainian troops in different directions. But they say new recruits are being thrown into battle with no preparation.\n\nSerhii Hayday, head of the Ukrainian Regional Military Administration in Luhansk, said last week that near Svatove, raw conscripts had advanced in waves.\n\n“They die, and the next ones go forward. Every new attack is accompanied by the fact that the Russians are trampling their dead.”\n\nAs winter sets in, the need for accommodation and supplies for troops far from home base is even more critical.\n\nNatalia Ivanova posted on the VKcontact page of a regional official that her husband’s unit was kept waiting for hours outside, before the deployment was canceled. “Now everyone is sick, with a temperature!” she said.\n\nStepananeko points to instances of protests among newly mobilized troops yet to be sent to Ukraine – principally over pay – “with two notable examples being in Chuvashia and Ulyansk.”\n\nVideo emerged earlier this month of dozens of men in Chuvashia, a republic in central Russia, angry that they had not received the 195,000 rubles promised in a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnofficial Telegram channels said the whole unit had subsequently been placed under house arrest.\n\nAcross Russia, relatives of the mobilized are also chasing unpaid compensation, for example, for buying uniform when it was not issued, with CNN finding many such posts on local government social media.\n\nDozens of mobilized men in Kazan region protested due to poor conditions at their training ground and a lack of water, food and firewood for heating. In one video, a man is heard demanding that washing machines are installed. Then, he said, they “would be happy to be in the mud every day from morning to evening.”\n\nIt’s too early to make a full assessment of the impact of Russia’s mobilization of more than 300,000 men. That’s double the number of men involved at the start of the Ukrainian invasion and would help plug gaps in units degraded by nine months of conflict.\n\nBut the caliber of these troops, leadership in the field and a logistics chain that has never excelled do not bode well for the Russian army.\n\nStepanenko thinks it’s possible “that more reports of deaths or lack of payments may upset more Russians – both those who are pro-war and those who are only involved in the war because of mobilization.”\n\nFor the moment, mobilization has not brought Putin’s special military operation any closer to its stated goals.\n\nIndeed, in chunks of regions annexed with such fanfare by Russia in September, the Ukrainian flag is being raised again.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Katharina Krebs Anastasia Graham-Yooll", "Tim Lister", "Katharina Krebs", "Anastasia Graham-Yooll"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/02/sweden-reinstates-draft-over-concerns-russia/98641010/", "title": "Sweden reinstates military draft over concerns about Russian ...", "text": "Doug Stanglin\n\nUSATODAY\n\nSweden is reinstating the military draft — for men and women — because of dwindling volunteers and growing concerns over a more assertive Russia in the Baltic and Ukraine.\n\n\"The security environment in Europe and in Sweden's vicinity has deteriorated and the all-volunteer recruitment hasn't provided the Armed Forces with enough trained personnel,\" the Swedish defense ministry said Thursday. \"The re-activating of the conscription is needed for military readiness.\"\n\nA defense ministry spokesperson says 4,000 men and women will be called up in July for service beginning in January 2018.

Both Finland and Estonia, which is a NATO member, said aircraft violated their airspace, The Washington Post reported.\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said he was inspired to make the draft gender-neutral by neighboring Norway, which in 2013 introduced a law applying military conscription to both sexes. That made Norway the first NATO member to draft both men and women, joining a tiny group of countries around the world, including Israel.\n\nTurkey and Germany are the only major NATO countries that still use a draft. Conscription also exists in Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece and Norway, according to Deutsche Welle. France ended the draft in 2001. Italy and the Netherlands put the draft on hold.\n\nSweden first introduced conscription in 1901 but canceled it in 2010, in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War era, nearly 85% of Swedish men were drafted into the army because of the nearby Soviet threat. The average term of service lasted around 11 months.\n\nThis time, the conscripts will serve from nine months to a year. One goal is to entice some draftees to make a career in the military.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the Swedish armed forces were short about 1,000 full-time squad leaders, soldiers and sailors and about 7,000 part-timers for its 17,000-member force, the defense ministry said. Sweden, with a population of 9.8 million, also relies on some 22,000 members of its volunteer Home Guards.\n\nNon-aligned Sweden, which prides itself on a tradition of neutrality, has not fought a war since 1814 when it engaged in a 12-day scrum with Norway.\n\nAlthough Sweden, along with its neighbor, Finland, is not a member of NATO, since 1994 it has cooperated closely with the organization under its Partnership for Peace program. Sweden has also contributed forces to NATO-led peacekeeping missions, including in Afghanistan and Kosovo.\n\nRussia, under President Vladimir Putin, has pointedly cautioned both Sweden and Finland not to join the Western alliance.\n\nHultqvist, in rejecting any bid to join NATO, told reporters last year Sweden's strategy was \"to create long-term stability and not to work in an unpredictable way.\" He said Sweden would \"not be part of a situation that could be used by others to create a higher level of tension.\"\n\nTensions in the area have been on the rise for at least two years, however, prompting concern in Stockholm.\n\nLast year, Sweden once again began stationing troops on Gotland island, which had long served as part of its island defenses. Gotland is located about 55 miles east of the Swedish mainland and about 80 miles from Latvia, a Baltic state that was once a Soviet republic.\n\nFor its part, Russia decided in October to reinforce its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships in response to what Moscow viewed as stepped up NATO activity in the region, Russia's daily Izvestia reported.\n\nThe decision by the ruling Swedish Social Democratic party to reinstate the draft was supported by the opposition Moderate Party as well as the Liberal Party.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/europe/ukraine-russian-referendums-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin speech: Russia announces immediate 'partial mobilization' of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced the immediate “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens on Wednesday, a move that threatens to escalate his faltering invasion of Ukraine following a string of defeats that caused recriminations in Moscow.\n\nPutin said in a speech that he would use “all the means at our disposal,” and even raised the specter of nuclear weapons, if he deemed the “territorial integrity” of Russia to be jeopardized.\n\nThe mobilization means citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, Putin said, adding that the necessary decree had already been signed and took effect on Wednesday.\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Russian television Wednesday morning that the country will call up 300,000 reservists. “These are not some people who have never heard of the army,” Shoigu said. “These are those who have served, have a military registration specialty, have had military experience.”\n\nIt comes after a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive through most of occupied Kharkiv swung momentum in the conflict back towards Kyiv this month.

But this is a kind of panic reaction,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added Wednesday.\n\nA destroyed Russian tank in Izium, a town recently liberated by Ukrainian Armed Forces. Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\nReferendums announced\n\nThe referendums, which Putin backed during his speech Wednesday, could pave the way for Russian annexation of the areas, allowing Moscow to frame the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive there as an attack on Russia itself, thereby providing Moscow with a pretext to escalate its military response.\n\nIn what appeared to be a coordinated announcement, Russian-appointed leaders in the occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic all said they planned to hold “votes” beginning on September 23.\n\nTogether the four regions that have announced their referendum plans make up around 18% of Ukraine’s territory. Russia does not control any of the four in their entirety.\n\nThe expected referendums, which run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty, have been announced as world leaders have descended on New York for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where the war and it impacts were already poised to loom large.\n\nUkraine has dismissed the announcement of referendums in the occupied regions as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat,” while the the country’s Western supporters signaled they would not alter their support for Ukraine.\n\nUS Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink wrote on Twitter Wednesday that “sham referenda and mobilization are signs of weakness, of Russian failure. The United States will never recognize Russia’s claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”\n\nPutin on Wednesday said Russia has been asked for support from the two “people’s republics” and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia for the referendums and had pledged to do “everything to ensure the safe conditions for people to express their will.”\n\nPotential for escalation\n\nThe announcements had already received swift support from Russian politicians. Former Russian President and vice-chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has publicly endorsed referendums in the self-declared Donbas republics, saying this would have “huge significance” for “systemic protection” of the residents.\n\n“Encroachment on Russian territory is a crime which allows you to use all the forces of self-defense,” Medvedev said on his Telegram channel, in an apparent allusion to the potential for the military escalation.\n\nBut social media video geolocated by CNN showed protests in several Russian cities on Wednesday, each involving what appear to have been a few dozen people. The independent monitoring group OVD-Info said that more than 100 people had been detained at anti-mobilization demonstrations in total.\n\nIt’s unclear what form an escalation could take, but concerns have been raised throughout the conflict over whether Russia would resort to using its nuclear stockpile in the Ukraine.\n\nA billboard promoting contract army service, with the slogan \"Serving Russia is a real job,\" in St. Petersburg.

But conscription remains a touchy topic in Ukraine, and officials have had to tread lightly amid dwindling enthusiasm for military service. Last year, Al Jazeera reported \"feared patrols\" hunting for potential conscripts, as officials searching for recruits \"stalk nightclubs, concerts and subway stations\". There are accusations that some are employing \"dubious measures\", including that they \"round people up randomly\".\n\nUkraine's \"inherent weakness is that it depends on others for funding and arms\", wrote the BBC's international editor, Jeremy Bowen. On the other hand, Russia \"makes most of its own weapons\" and is \"buying drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea\" with no limitations on how they are used.\n\nIt also enjoys an advantage in raw manpower, yet this has not stopped Vladimir Putin from bolstering his fighting force even further. On Tuesday he ordered 160,000 Russian men aged between 18 and 30 be called up to the reserves in what is the \"largest conscription drive in 14 years\", said Sky News.\n\nWhile Russian authorities claim it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine, \"in the long term, it has everything to do with the conflict, and the wider geopolitical tensions\", said Sky's Moscow correspondent Ivor Bennett.\n\nPutin's aim is to have a bigger army than America's, with 1.5 million active servicemen.\n\nThe latest draft is \"a result of this, and it's a sign of Russia's relentless militarisation. Whatever the outcome of peace talks, the Kremlin will remain on a war footing for some time yet.\"\n\nWhat does victory look like for each side?\n\nBefore Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, Putin outlined the objectives of what he called a \"special military operation\". His goal, he claimed, was to \"denazify\" and \"demilitarise\" Ukraine, and to defend Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.\n\nAnother objective, although never explicitly stated, was to topple the Ukrainian government and remove the country's president, Zelenskyy. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Zelenskyy shortly after the invasion. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound.\n\nRussia shifted its objectives, however, about a month into the invasion, after Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. According to the Kremlin, its main goal became the \"liberation of the Donbas\", including the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – but Moscow has made little progress in achieving this aim.\n\nRussia has since scaled back its objectives. The Kremlin's \"minimum requirement\" appears to be \"occupying the entirety of the Donbas region (comprising the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk)\", said The Economist. It also wants to regain \"control of Russia's own Kursk region, which Ukraine has partly occupied\", and hold on to \"the 'land bridge' it seized in the early stages of the war connecting Crimea to Russia\".\n\nUkraine's main objective remains the liberation of its occupied territories. That includes not just those held by Russia since the February 2022 invasion, but a return to its internationally recognised borders, including Crimea.\n\nHow many Russian and Ukrainian troops have died in the conflict?\n\nTrue casualty figures are \"notoriously difficult to pin down\", said Newsweek, and \"experts caution that both sides likely inflate the other's reported losses\".\n\nMore than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 380,000 injured on the battlefield, Zelenskyy said in an interview with NBC in February, with \"tens of thousands\" missing or in Russian captivity. However, in February, UALosses, a web project that records Ukrainian casualty data from open sources, listed more than 70,400 names.\n\nMoscow has also had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine. \"The true number could be more than double,\" said the BBC.\n\nUkraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost a total of 859,920 troops, a figure believed to include \"dead, wounded, missing and captured\" soldiers, said The Kyiv Independent in February.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Fergus Scholes", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Harriet Marsden", "Elliott Goat", "Sorcha Bradley", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/09/03/lubar-cant-we-get-smarter-war/629979001/", "title": "Lubar: Can't we get smarter about war?", "text": "Sheldon B. Lubar\n\nAs I think back, it seems that there were only a few years of my life when our country wasn’t engaged in a war. As the technology of war advances and it becomes ever costlier, it saps the largest part of our national budget. In addition, it has a long-term expensive tail. I would opine that if we hadn’t fought these many foreign wars, we would not have a national debt that today is about $20 trillion and growing. At its worst, with the spread of nuclear weapons, the entire planet is at risk of destruction if we continue to rely on war to settle disputes.\n\nI was born in 1929. World War I had ended 12 years earlier. World War II started 10 years later and ended in 1945. While I was a college student, we became involved in the Korean War, which ended in a stalemate in 1953. I should add that I planned to join the Air Force and serve upon graduation and was disappointed when I wasn’t called up. I was young and patriotic. I have since learned that wars don’t accomplish anything for either side.\n\nWe became involved in the Vietnam War at the tail end of John Kennedy’s administration. Under our new leader, President Lyndon Johnson and his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, our participation grew. The time frame was the mid-1960s and the military draft was still on. This war was unpopular, especially with young men who were being drafted and sent into the jungles to fight and die against an enemy whose only crime was fighting to maintain a communist form of government for their country. There were demonstrations and riots on campuses over our entire country.\n\nAt that time, I was a very outspoken critic of our involvement. Friends would ask me “how can you be in Milwaukee with no special knowledge and think you can determine a strategy so different from our leaders.” My answer was: “Only an acclaimed genius can mislead the majority of the country, and Robert McNamara is such a man, but his policy will be disastrous.”\n\nI also said the effect of this division in our country will take 10 years to heal. I was wrong. It is now more than 50 years later, and we still aren’t together. As if this wasn’t enough, we have had Iraq War I, Iraq War II, the Afghanistan War and now the war against ISIS. For the blood and money that has been spent on these wars, we could have rebuilt our country’s infrastructure and given a free college education to every high school graduate and had no national debt.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nCan’t we get smart? Can’t we see that these wars bring only pain and unimaginable costs? Worst of all, they divide us. I believe that by broadening the powers of NATO and the United Nations we can establish a workable world of laws and peace.\n\nInstead of individual armies, there should be only one army which would be created by expanding NATO to include Russia and other countries who could gain admission by applying. When a country has broken the law as determined by the UN, leaders of that country fighting against the UN / NATO Army would be considered war criminals and subject to appropriate punishment by a war crimes court.\n\nSheldon B.

Sign up\n\nThe last wave of conscription in September 2022 prompted an exodus of hundreds of thousands of young men to neighbouring countries. So to encourage men to enlist, the Kremlin has launched a massive media campaign appealing to the notion of “warrior masculinity”.\n\nRussian news outlets and social media platforms as well as billboards and lampposts in big cities have been filled with adverts explaining that a man who joins the military is a hero – a real man deserving respect and admiration.\n\nThe advertising videos tell the stories of men who volunteered to join up. It’s a familiar tale of how signing up drastically improves men’s lives. Their children and wives admire their heroism, their ex-girlfriends fall in love with them again and they gain the respect of their communities.\n\nThose who have left are portrayed as selfish cowards, as with one advert in which a woman says: “The boys left, the men stayed.” Another advert, which ends with the caption “You’re a real man, be one,” emphasises the good wages on offer to men who join up. Enlisting is presented as a means to improve one’s financial standing – pay off a debt, buy a car, move out from a small town into a large city.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBut how effective are campaigns like this? My research on Russian masculinities suggests that the themes of “be a man” and “make more money” play into two of the most common anxieties among Russian men. But the problems experienced last September when – according to some reports – up to 700,000 left Russia to avoid conscription (something the Kremlin has denied) suggests that these messages haven’t worked very well.\n\nTwo paradoxes, which are legacies of the fall of the Soviet Union, can help explain the lukewarm response to the call to arms.\n\nUnwilling to serve\n\nThe first is a structural contradiction which has persisted since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Despite the fact that military service remains a constitutional duty for men aged 18-27, only a minority of men in the draft pool end up serving in the armed forces. The rest avoid military call-up via legal and illegal means.\n\nAccording to Canadian researcher Maya Eichler, compared to the Soviet era when 70% to 85% of draft-age men were conscripted, in the first post-Soviet decade or so the Russian state was only able to call up about 10% to 30% of men in the draft pool.\n\nSecondly, my research has found that while Russian men tend to support the military as an institution, they are very critical of the way it is run in Russia. Men I spoke to – across several generations – called the Russian army “corrupt”, “venal”, “deeply damaged”, “rotten”, “discredited”, “severely underfunded”, and “a shameful place based on dedovshchina” (hazing and bullying).\n\nI conducted these interviews in 2012-2014 and found the majority of men I spoke with expressed personal unwillingness to serve in the Russian army and were strictly against their own sons serving.\n\nMy research comprised in-depth biographical interviews with 40 Russian men of different ages and highly varied socioeconomic and professional backgrounds living in Russia and in the UK. In almost half of those interviews, militarised notions of masculinity and heroic fantasies were expressed. For 17 participants, the idea of being a man was first and foremost linked to the notion of a “warrior” or “defender”.\n\nConversations about the military were one of the main grounds where Russian men negotiated and established their masculinity, as well as that of other men. A lack of military experience was explicitly or implicitly perceived as a lack of respectable masculinity. This was evident whether or not the men I was interviewing had done military service.\n\nDespite Putin’s military reforms, my interviewees regarded Soviet and post-Soviet Russian armies as two completely different social institutions. The former was seen as a social lift, a place where masculinity is forged and where ordinary men become heroes. The post-Soviet army, by contrast, was often seen as a corrupt and dangerous place, a waste of time, and a place for poor people with no other life prospects.\n\nDemilitarising masculinities\n\nIn 2004, a Human Rights Watch report found that the transition to a market economy had a serious impact on conscription. Young men from relatively privileged backgrounds can buy their way out of the army or get a draft deferment to attend university, so the majority of conscripts in Russia “come from the most disadvantaged, least affluent parts of society”.\n\nIn her 2012 book, Militarizing Men: Gender, Conscription, and War in Post-Soviet Russia, Canadian scholar Maya Eichler asserts that army service has become “increasingly tied to a marginal masculinity differentiated by class”.\n\nThe Russian army in Ukraine is overwhelmingly made up of soldiers from the poorest regions of the country. Mobilisation has also disproportionately targeted ethnic minority regions such as republics of Buryatia and Dagestan, where for many, signing an army contract is the only way to make a living.\n\nThe breakdown of the Soviet social contract on which men’s soldiering rested (guaranteed employment, housing, and other state-funded benefits) and the failure of the Russian state to provide similarly tangible rewards radically undermined men’s willingness to serve in the military.\n\nThe transition to capitalism and free market created new notions of masculinity tied to financial success. This new masculinity entered into conflict with the patriotic, self-sacrificing militarised masculinity of the Soviet times.\n\nIn his work on the contradictions in modern militarism, US scholar Michael Mann likens public interest in the national use of armed forces to a “spectator sport”. I found this in my research, where it became clear that the Soviet-era citizen-soldier has turned into a citizen-spectator. Individuals may vocally support militarism while refusing to personally engage in any military practices.\n\nMarina Yusupova, Lecturer in Sociology, Edinburgh Napier University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

A ramped-up assault on ...", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia’s military says it has moved on to a new phase of its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, claiming that it is shifting its focus to the Donbas region in Ukraine’s east.\n\nIs this regrouping of forces a feint – allowing battered Russian forces to regroup after suffering serious losses at the hands of Ukrainian defenders – or a simple face-saving measure? Is Russia actually moving troops and equipment to concentrate on Ukraine’s east, where Moscow has recognized two separatist republics?\n\nOn paper, that seems to be the case. Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said a “planned regrouping of troops” was underway around Kyiv and Chernihiv, one day after Russian negotiators said Moscow’s forces would take steps toward de-escalation around those two cities. He said Russian forces were regrouping in order to “intensify operations in priority areas and, above all, to complete the operation for the complete liberation of Donbas.”\n\nUS officials and military analysts have rightly been skeptical of Russia’s claims of de-escalation, and some observers have suggested Russia’s shifting military objectives are meant to conceal massive setbacks on the battlefield. But there is evidence that Russian military activity is ramping up in the east: Ukrainian officials on Thursday reported heavy shelling of a number of Ukrainian cities, particularly in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of the Donbas and around the northeastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nEscalating attacks in eastern Ukraine\n\nIn a statement on Telegram, Oleh Synyehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said: “Over the past day, Russian troops have struck 47 times with artillery, mortar, tank, and strikes in the areas of Piatihatky, Oleksiyivka, and the residential area of the Kharkiv Traсtor Plant district. About 380 shellings from Grad and Smerch [rocket artillery] were recorded. In Saltivka, the enemy damaged the gas pipeline, there was a major fire, and rescuers have worked to localize it.”\n\nSynyehubov said Russian forces had inflicted heavy fire on Derhachi, northwest of the city of Kharkiv, killing one person and injuring three others, and destroying a city council building.\n\n“The fiercest point [in Kharkiv region] remains Izium, where fighting and constant shelling continue,” he said. “We are working every day to open ‘green’ [humanitarian] corridors. But so far Russia does not give us such an opportunity.”\n\nUkrainian military governors in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions also reported heavy shelling Thursday amid an apparent shift by the Russian military to redirect military efforts to the Donbas region.\n\n“We clearly feel that the transfer of [military] technology in our direction is beginning now,” said Serhiy Haidai, Head of Luhansk region military administration, in televised remarks. “And as the equipment and personnel are being turned over, our enemies are simply firing more densely, powerfully. Everything is already involved here: aircraft, artillery, heavy-caliber weapons, mortars — all settlements are being shelled.”\n\nRussian soldiers seen on a tank in the separatist-controlled Volnovakha district of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, on March 26. Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nPavlo Kyrylenko, Head of Donetsk region military administration, said on Telegram that Russian forces overnight continued shelling in the central part of the region.\n\n“In Maryinka, Krasnohorivka and Novomykhailivka, the enemy again used white phosphorous shells,” he said, referring to munitions that are either banned or circumscribed under international law in populated areas. “Eleven wounded civilians from the Maryinka community, including 4 children, were taken to the Kurakhiv City Hospital.”\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia never violates international conventions when asked to comment on a claim by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding the alleged use of phosphorus bombs by Russian forces, Russian media reported.\n\nQuestions about Russian troop morale\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said in a statement Thursday that Russian forces may indeed be regrouping on the territory of Belarus, which has been a staging area for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe statement said the movement of Russian military equipment had been observed in Belarus, “probably for regrouping units, as well as creating a reserve to replenish losses in manpower, weapons and equipment of groups operating in Ukraine.”\n\nOutside analysis suggests that Russian troops have seen serious equipment losses and heavy casualties. The Russian military said nearly a week ago that 1,351 military personnel had been killed in Ukraine and 3,825 had been wounded, casualty figures that the US, Ukraine and NATO say represent a serious underreporting of troop losses.\n\nJeremy Fleming, Director of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK spy agency speaking during a trip to Canberra, Australia, suggested that Russian troop morale was seriously plummeting and that Russian President Vladimir Putin – who lives in an information bubble as well as in physical isolation – may not be aware of the extent of the problem for his military.\n\n“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.”\n\nPutin on Thursday signed a decree to draft 134,500 Russians into the military to replace conscripts who are rotating out of service.\n\nThe Russian military has a mixed manpower system that has draftees as well as contract servicemembers, and the country has a twice-annual call-up for conscription.\n\nPutin originally claimed that conscripts would not take part in the war, but the Russian defense ministry subsequently acknowledged that draftees were fighting in Ukraine – and Ukrainian forces claim to have taken a considerable number of Russian conscripts prisoner.\n\nAn intensifying humanitarian crisis\n\nThe humanitarian situation remains grave in many Ukrainian cities, particularly in the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol.\n\nOn Thursday, hopes were raised of the possibility that busloads of residents of Mariupol – which has been under weeks of relentless shelling and bombing by Russian forces – might be able to leave through a so-called humanitarian corridor.\n\nBut the convoy was held up at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, a city between the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia and the Russian-held city of Berdiansk, according to Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories.\n\nVereshchuk said about 100,000 people requiring immediate evacuation remain in the city, out of a pre-war population of over 400,000.\n\n“That is, another 100,000 women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who need our and the world’s help,” she said.\n\nUkrainian officials say around 90% of the buildings in the city have been damaged or left uninhabitable after weeks of bombardment.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}]}

Today Admiral Kauffman is remembered as the nation's first frogman and the father of the Navy Seals. His spectacular wartime service disarming enemy bombs, establishing bomb disposal schools, and organizing and leading the Navy’s first demolition units is the focus of this biography written by his sister. Elizabeth Kauffman Bush, who also is the aunt of President George W. Bush, draws on family papers as well as Navy documents to tell Kauffman's story for the first time.\n\nDetermined to defend the cause of freedom long before the U.S. ever entered the war, Kauffman was taken prisoner by the Germans as an ambulance driver in France. After his release, he joined the Royal Navy to defuse delayed-action bombs during the London blitz. Sent home to recover from his wounds, Kauffman was given a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve in November 1941. Because of his prior experience, he was asked to establish an underwater demolition school in Fort Pierce, where he personally trained men to defuse bombs and neutralize other submerged dangers. The team was sent to demolish the obstacles installed by the Nazis at Normandy, and Kauffman himself led underwater demolition teams at Saipan, Tinian, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Because of the high standards he set for those who became frogmen, thousands of American lives were saved in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.\n\nAlways leading by example, Draper Kauffman established underwater demolition traditions of perseverance, teamwork and a lasting brotherhood of men of extraordinary courage that are carried on by Navy SEALs today. Bush records her brother’s legacy to the U.S. Navy and the details of his life with a historian’s attention to detail and a novelist’s flare for storytelling.\n\n“The Barefoot Mailman” by Theodore Pratt (1943)\n\nThe story of how mail was carried on foot along the beach in South Florida to Miami in the 1880s.\n\n“Before They Were SEALS They Were Frogs” by William “Bill” Dawson with Tom Hawkins and Lisa Merriam (2015)\n\nIt’s the story of the last living member of Class 1 of the Naval Special Warfare Operations, that evolved into the Navy SEALS.\n\nBill Dawson, the last living member from that class, then known as Naval Combat Demolition Units, one of the predecessor groups to the modern-day Navy SEALs, provides a rare first-person look into the training, personalities and non-classified activities of his unit in the Pacific Theater of Operations from 1943 until the end of his service after the Japanese surrender.\n\nThe book reproduces photographs Dawson took during his service, vintage clippings and rare examples of Japanese propaganda. Retired Navy SEAL Commander and noted Naval Special Warfare historian Tom Hawkins adds historic perspective and detail.\n\n“The Everglades: River of Grass” by Marjory Stoneman Douglas (1947)\n\nBefore 1947, when Marjory Stoneman Douglas named The Everglades a “river of grass,” most people considered the area worthless. She brought the world’s attention to the need to preserve the Everglades.\n\nIn the new and updated afterword, Michael Grunwald again tells us what has happened to them since then. Grunwald points out that in 1947 the government was in the midst of establishing the Everglades National Park and turning loose the Army Corps of Engineers to control floods — both of which seemed like saviors for the Glades. But neither turned out to be the answer. Working from the research he did for his book, “The Swamp,” Grunwald offers an account of what went wrong and the many attempts to fix it, beginning with Save Our Everglades, which Douglas declared was “not nearly enough.” Grunwald then lays out the intricacies (and inanities) of the more recent and ongoing CERP, the hugely expensive Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.\n\n“Florida’s Ashley Gang\" by Ada Coats Williams (1996)\n\nAda Coats Williams, a retired teacher of creative writing of Fort Pierce’s Indian River Community College, completed the first book on the Ashleys since 1928′s “The Notorious Ashley Gang” by Hix C. Stuart, according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nWilliams was a good candidate to write it because she was there. Her family settled the area in the 1870s. She had gotten the real story about the Ashley Gang’s shooting in the 1950s from a retired deputy who’d been on the bridge that night. His one condition: she keep it secret until after all the deputies involved had died. Williams kept her promise.\n\n“Floridays” by Don Blanding (1941)\n\nFrom his “house in a hammock,” Don Blanding writes and draws vivid pictures of his newest home, Florida.\n\nThis impression of coastal life is both timeless and universal, a classic in every sense of the word, by a talented vagabond who roamed the world from Paris to the South Seas before settling down in the Sunshine State. Flamingos set against a tropical sunset, pelicans wheeling above turquoise waters and tarpon leaping high into the moonlight, along with the first trickle of tourists seeking respite from the rest of the world, were but some of the things view from Don Blanding’s own special viewpoint. His poetry illustrated with his own pen was at once wry, witty, and always on the mark. Don Blanding took Florida’s spirit to heart, then expressed it in a way which locals and visitors alike might still enjoy, time and time again.\n\n“The Highwaymen: Florida’s African-American Landscape Painters” by Gary Monroe (2001)\n\nThe Highwaymen introduces a group of young black artists who painted their way out of the despair awaiting them in citrus groves and packing houses of 1950s Florida. As their story recaptures the imagination of Floridians and their paintings fetch ever-escalating prices, the legacy of their freshly conceived landscapes exerts a new and powerful influence on the popular conception of the Sunshine State.\n\nWhile the value of Highwaymen paintings has soared in recent years, until now no authoritative account of the lives and work of these black Florida artists has existed. Emerging in the late 1950s, the Highwaymen created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida dream and peddled, by some estimates, 200,000 of them from the trunks of their cars.\n\nWorking with inexpensive materials, the Highwaymen produced an astonishing number of landscapes that depict a romanticized Florida — a faraway place of wind-swept palm trees, billowing cumulus clouds, wetlands, lakes, rivers, ocean, and setting sun. With paintings still wet, they loaded their cars and traveled the state's east coast, selling the images door-to-door and store-to-store, in restaurants, offices, courthouses and bank lobbies.\n\nSometimes characterized as motel art, the work is a hybrid form of landscape painting, corrupting the classically influenced ideals of the Highwaymen’s white mentor, A. E. “Bean” Backus. At first, the paintings sold like boom-time real estate. In succeeding decades, however, they were consigned to attics and garage sales. Rediscovered in the mid-1990s, today they are recognized as the work of American folk artists.\n\nGary Monroe tells the story behind the Highwaymen, a loose association of 25 men and one woman from the Fort Pierce area — a fascinating mixture of individual talent, collective enterprise and cultural heritage. He also offers a critical look at the paintings and the movement's development. Added to this are personal reminiscences by some of the artists, along with a gallery of 63 full-color reproductions of their paintings.\n\n“An Ice Age Mystery: Unearthing the Secrets of the Old Vero Site” by Rody Johnson (2017)\n\nIn 1916, to the shock of the scientific community and the world at large, a Florida geologist discovered human remains mixed with the bones of prehistoric animals in a Vero Beach canal and proclaimed that humans had lived in North America since the Ice Age. These new findings by Elias Sellards flew in the face of prevailing wisdom, which held that humans first came to the continent only 6,000 years ago. His claim was snubbed by the top scientists of his day, he was laughed out of the state, Vero's fame declined, and the skull Sellards found — famously known as “Vero Man” — was lost.\n\nAn Ice Age Mystery tells the story of Sellards's exciting find and the controversy it sparked. In the years that followed, other archaeological discoveries and the rise of radiocarbon dating established that humans did arrive in North America earlier than previously thought. The skull, however, was never recovered, and many people began to wonder: What exactly had Sellards found at Vero? And what else might be buried there?\n\nOne hundred years after the first Vero discovery, construction plans threatened to cover up the legendary dig site, and a band of citizens and archaeologists protested. Excavations were reopened. Archaeologists uncovered 14,000-year-old burnt mammal bones and charcoal, signs of a human presence, and found further evidence to indicate a continuous human occupation of the site for several thousand years. Prior to the latest excavations an etching on a bone possibly 13,000 years old was discovered that could be the oldest piece of art in America. Sellards had been right all along.\n\nMany questions still remain. Who were these people? Where did they come from? And how did they get here? This book draws readers into the past, present, and future of one of the most historic discoveries in American archaeology.\n\n“Jonathan Dickinson’s Journal” by Jonathan Dickinson (1699)\n\nA true story of shipwreck and torture on the Florida Coast in 1696, originally titled “God’s Protecting Providence: Being in the Narrative of a Journey from Port Royal in Jamaica to Philadelphia between August 23, 1696 and April 1, 1697.”\n\nThe barkentine Reformation, sailing from Jamaica to Philadelphia, was wrecked off Jupiter Island 5 miles from the Florida coast. Jonathan Dickinson, a young Quaker merchant, with his wife and infant son, and a party of about 20, managed to reach the mainland, only to fall into the hands of a band of hostile Indians. Held captive at a wigwam village for several weeks, Dickinson observed first hand and later recorded in his journal a fascinating account of Indian life, rituals and customs. Beaten and almost starved, Dickinson’s party was finally released and began the harrowing struggle up the Florida coast 230 miles to St. Augustine. On the way, five members died of exposure and exhaustion. After two weeks rest, the Spanish governor sent them by open boat through the sea island passages of Georgia and South Carolina to Charleston, where they took ship for Philadelphia. A modern traveler, retracing Jonathan Dickinson’s steps, would find much of the route in its natural state, as it appeared to these valiant colonists nearly 300 years ago. Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Martin County commemorates the noble group who bravely shared this historic adventure.\n\n“A Land Remembered” by Patrick D. Smith* (1984)\n\nIn this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons.\n\nThe story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife.\n\nA Land Remembered was winner of the Florida Historical Society’s Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel.\n\n*plus anything written by Patrick D. Smith, including “The River is Home,” “Angel City,” “Forever Island” and “Allapattah”\n\n“The Last Cracker Barrel” by Ernest Lyons* (1975)\n\nThe Last Cracker Barrel is about a Florida without tourists, land developments or flood-control projects. It’s is about an older Florida and a quieter style of life, when people took time to notice the ways of fish and flowers, birds and the river and, especially, their fellow man.\n\nThe author’s way among these mysteries is a gentle, earthly path of plain-spoken words that can guide the reader to a new understanding of the countryside and people around him. That older world of nature and small towns can still be seen by those who know how to look for it.\n\n“Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean” by Les Standiford (2002)\n\nLast Train to Paradise is acclaimed novelist Les Standiford’s fast-paced and gripping true account of the extraordinary construction and spectacular demise of the Key West Railroad — one of the greatest engineering feats ever undertaken, destroyed in one fell swoop by the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.\n\nBrilliant and driven entrepreneur Henry Flagler’s dream fulfilled, the Key West Railroad stood as a magnificent achievement for more than 22 years, heralded as “the Eighth Wonder of the World.” Standiford brings the full force and fury of 1935’s deadly “Storm of the Century” and its sweeping destruction of “the railroad that crossed an ocean” to terrifying life. Last Train to Paradise celebrates a crowning achievement of Gilded Age ambition in a sweeping tale of the powerful forces of human ingenuity colliding with the even greater forces of nature’s wrath.\n\n“Memories of Eden” compiled/edited by Raymond Richards Brown (1996)\n\nA young girl’s letters about life in South Florida’s frontier from 1880-1888. An authentic and heartwarming account of Lucie’s daily struggle to civilize the Florida wilderness with her courage, ingenuity, optimism and unfailing sense of humor.\n\n“Our Worthy Commander” by Louis H. Burbey (1976)\n\nThe life and times of Benjamin K. Pierce, in whose honor Fort Pierce was named. The biographical book was published by the Indian River Community College Historical Data Center.\n\n“Red Patriots: The Story of the Seminoles” by Charles H. Coe (1898)\n\nThe latest history of the Seminole War was published soon after the termination of hostilities, more than a half century ago. The present volume has been written more from the standpoint of the Indian, and includes much new and interesting information, and the correction of many erroneous ideas, in connection with almost every leading feature of Seminole history. New light has been shed, not only upon the earlier movements and struggles of this liberty-loving race, but upon their condition and customs in our present peaceful times.\n\n“Whistled Like a Bird: The Untold Story of Dorothy Putnam, George Putnam, and Amelia Earhart” by Sally Putnam Chapman with Stephanie Mansfield (1997)\n\nIn the summer of 1928, Dorothy Binney Putnam, free-spirited heiress to the Crayola crayon fortune and George Putnam’s wife, was becoming Amelia Earhart’s new best friend. Amelia Earhart, having just flown across the Atlantic to make aviation history, was staying at the Putnam family mansion in New York. George Putnam, the famous New York publisher and avid explorer who had arranged her flight, was falling in love with her. The bond between the two women would change their lives forever as a story of passion and discovery began.\n\nIn this extraordinary, true story about an independent woman, a world-famous aviator and the powerful man who loved them both, Sally Putnam Chapman, the granddaughter of Dorothy Binney Putnam and George Putnam, recounts a treasure trove of memories, spanning the years 1907 to 1961, culled from her grandmother’s diaries.\n\n“Storm of the Century: The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935” by Willie Drye (2002)\n\nOn Labor Day weekend, 1935, the Depression-ravaged Florida Keys took another blow: the greatest hurricane to ever hit the United States. The nameless storm blasted buildings to smithereens with 200 mile-an-hour winds and a 20-foot high storm surge of raging water that stripped bare the low-lying islands. Author Willie Drye deftly weaves a moment-by-moment tapestry of first-person accounts into his tale of the fateful storm, evoking the frugal life of the handful of families that inhabited this island outpost and the desperate situation of more than 400 World War I veterans sent to the Keys on a New Deal construction project to build a highway linking the islands. As hurricane warnings mount, government bureaucrats dither, fatefully delaying the arrival of an evacuation train. Storm of the Century, the result of years of investigative reporting, vividly captures the fury of the hurricane and tells the sorry story of a tragedy that could and should have been avoided.\n\n“Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston*” by Valerie Boyd (2003)\n\nA woman of enormous talent and remarkable drive, Zora Neale Hurston published seven books, many short stories, and several articles and plays over a career that spanned more than thirty years. Today, nearly every black woman writer of significance — including Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker — acknowledges Hurston as a literary foremother, and her 1937 masterpiece Their Eyes Were Watching God has become a crucial part of the modern literary canon.\n\nWrapped in Rainbows, the first biography of Zora Neale Hurston in more than twenty-five years, illuminates the adventures, complexities, and sorrows of an extraordinary life. Acclaimed journalist Valerie Boyd delves into Hurston’s history — her youth in the country’s first incorporated all-black town, her friendships with luminaries such as Langston Hughes, her sexuality and short-lived marriages, and her mysterious relationship with vodou. With the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Depression, and World War II as historical backdrops, Wrapped in Rainbows not only positions Hurston’s work in her time but also offers riveting implications for our own.\n\n*plus anything written by Zora Neale Hurston, including “Their Eyes Were Watching God”\n\nDidn’t see your favorite book about the Treasure Coast and Florida on this list?

And it came just days after various countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States, slapped sanctions on assets belonging to Putin’s two adult daughters.\n\ncasey michel Versha Sharma\n\nDivesting oligarchs of their ill-gotten assets has proven to be a fruitful endeavor: Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the US Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on more than 530 well-heeled, well-connected Russians.\n\nFrom yachts to mansions to high-end artwork – much of it tied directly to illicit Kremlin-linked wealth – the total worth of Russian assets seized has grown into the billions as the West tries to tighten the squeeze on Putin for the bloody invasion, which now has entered its fourth month.\n\nBut while seizures of Russian assets have grabbed headlines, they don’t appear so far to have stalled Moscow’s bloody, bungled incursion. Nor have they slowed the mounting casualties or helped rebuild even one Ukrainian school or hospital reduced to rubble by Russian bombardments. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky estimated it will take some $600 billion to rebuild his country.\n\nAmericans are beginning to learn current moves to try to benefit Ukraine could take years, so out-of-the-box thinking on ways to help Russia’s war-torn neighbor is well within bounds.\n\nService members of pro-Russian troops drive an armoured vehicle along a street past a destroyed residential building during Ukraine-Russia conflict in the town of Popasna in the Luhansk Region, Ukraine May 26, 2022. The writing on the vehicle reads: \"Valkyrie\". REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nIs there more the West can do with confiscated Russian assets to help Ukraine’s cause? Can this frozen wealth actually be used to help Ukraine beat back the Russian imperialists bloodying their country?\n\nI, along with plenty of others in the counter-kleptocracy space, think so. More to the point, the US administration thinks so as well. Washington thinks it has found a way not only to keep confiscated assets from Russian reach, but to use them proactively in the fight against Putin’s regime.\n\nIn April, in a nearly unanimous vote, the US House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill calling on President Joe Biden to oversee the sales of a wide range of the frozen luxury assets linked to sanctioned Russian oligarchs. The US Senate is debating a companion bill which would allow the United States to use seized assets “for the benefit of the people of Ukraine.”\n\n“It is hard to imagine giving Russia’s wealth back to Putin while Ukraine lies in ruin and Ukrainians are burying their dead,” said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, who sponsored the bill along with Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina.\n\n“Under these extraordinary circumstances, the international community should be prepared to use Russia’s frozen assets to rebuild the country Russia is destroying,” Malinowski said.\n\nThe House bill calls on Biden to “confiscate” property worth more than $2 billion belonging to sanctioned entities and individuals linked to Putin. The measure also urges the White House to create an “interagency working group” ed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to establish “constitutional mechanisms” for converting frozen assets into capital for Ukrainians.\n\nThe measure is “virtually without precedent,” the New York Times wrote, not least because of how much the moves would expand presidential powers over sanctions. And although the legislation is nonbinding, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward, laying out a framework for putting seized Russian assets to use in Ukraine.\n\nIn an opinion column, Harvard constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe and his co-author Jeremy Lewin outlined the advantages of tapping Russia’s capital assets for the project of arming and rebuilding Ukraine. They rightly pointed out it would be “the fastest way to increase American aid to Ukraine without further burdening and fatiguing American taxpayers.”\n\nTribe and Levin also noted in their piece for the New York Times tapping the Russian funds would “send a potent signal that the United States is committed to making even the world’s most powerful states pay for their war crimes.”\n\nThe idea has gained international backing: In May, the finance ministers of Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Estonia insisted Russia must foot the bill for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\n\nOther legislative action in Congress doubles down on efforts to make Russia pay for invading Ukraine, including a bill introduced by Reps. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, and Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, which would ensure Ukrainians can seek monetary damages through the US courts for any losses incurred as a result of the Russian invasion, paid out by assets seized from Russia or Russian oligarchs the US government has sanctioned.\n\nFor its part, the White House issued a statement backing the legislation introduced by Wilson and Malinowski and calling for even more expansive powers allowing it to seize oligarchic assets for use in the broader fight against the Kremlin. The proposals by the White House would not only accelerate US efforts to sell off the assets and use the proceeds to bankroll Ukraine’s fight for independence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ukraine will fight until it gains all its territory back: President Zelensky 02:17 - Source: CNN Ukraine will fight until it gains all its territory back: President Zelensky 02:17\n\nThey would also expand the ability to target Russian assets more broadly, including by extending the statute of limitations for related crimes and expanding the definition of racketeering to include things like sanctions evasion. With those broader powers, the Biden administration would be empowered to tap “oligarchic assets” which would “enable the proceeds to flow to Ukraine,” the White House statement said.\n\nHowever, opponents have said they worry about the sweeping and unprecedented nature of the measures being considered. An early version of the House bill would have authorized the White House to transform seized assets into resources for Ukraine, but some rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union balked.\n\nThe ACLU and other groups have expressed the worry US courts could rule the president’s expanded powers are unconstitutional, a legal decision which would hand Russia a PR victory and allow Moscow to deride what will be portrayed as Washington’s ineptitude in leading the international sanctions process.\n\nOthers have raised similar concerns. Appropriating Russian assets for use by Ukraine is “a completely noble goal, but it does not take too much to extend this precedent out in ways we may not be comfortable with,” Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, explained to the Washington Post.\n\nAnd there are even voices within the administration opposing the idea of seizing Russia’s central bank assets for use by Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Europe in May she believed doing so would violate US law.\n\n“I think it’s very natural that given the enormous destruction in Ukraine and huge rebuilding costs that they will face, that we will look to Russia to help pay at least a portion of the price that will be involved,” Yellen told reporters in Bonn, Germany adding however “it’s not something that is legally permissible in the United States.”\n\nAmid the pushback, the House bill was reworked to address the concerns about the expansive scope of the original legislation. It will now simply create an interagency working group to analyze the best ways to work around these constitutional concerns, and proceed from there.\n\nConcerns about expanded presidential powers are not entirely without merit given ever-expanding authority of the executive branch –and recent history showing how those powers can be abused. It’s also important to be mindful those expanded powers will still be in place after the next presidential election in 2024, when there could be a different occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nBut these are unprecedented times. It should be clear at this point using the funds for Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction is much more productive than simply squatting on them.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe White House already has both the authority and the precedent to seize Russia’s liquid assets and should proceed without delay to deprive Moscow of its supposed nest egg. As part of the process, it should convene the best minds available during the upcoming working group to ensure all concerns about due process are properly addressed.\n\nAt this point one thing is clear: Russia’s disastrous turn demands solutions outside the current playbook. And using seized Russian assets to back Ukraine only makes sense, not only to deter Moscow, but to dissuade any bad acting regimes that might be tempted to follow in the Kremlin’s destructive and ruinous footsteps.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/30/gmo-salmon-tinder-health-foundation-fixes-news-around-states/39824105/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHomewood: Historic preservationists are trying to save a nearly century-old home near Birmingham with ties to the late authors Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. The Alabama Historical Commission has added the 1921 home, known by many as the “Pink House” for its distinctive color, to its “Places in Peril” list for 2019. Once owned by a Jazz Age sculptor and his wife, the house became a gathering spot for the rich and famous. A news release from the commission says visitors included Fitzgerald, Hemingway and the grand duchess of Russia. A developer bought the property two years ago with plans to demolish the house and build five new homes. The Homewood Historical Preservation Society says the “Pink House” could be demolished within months.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: Some area beekeepers believe there is a connection between pesticides and an increase in honeybee deaths. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports beekeepers and other residents have asked the Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly to pass an ordinance banning specific pesticides. The assembly says the borough can investigate but does not have the authority to regulate pesticide sprays. At least one beekeeper at a meeting last week singled out bifenthrin and deltamethrin, insecticides that are legal in the U.S. but must be certified for use on Alaska properties. Beekeepers say pesticides can drift between different properties if multiple pest elimination services are spraying in the same area. One hive owner says after nearby spraying, some of her bees died, while honey was discolored, and wax was unusually thick.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma: Yuma County officials say it’s not too late to save dark skies enjoyed by residents of rural areas separated by a mountain range from the Yuma area where urban lights obscure views of stars and planets. The county in southwestern Arizona is considering adopting an ordinance to impose new restrictions on outdoor lighting despite concerns that it could result in lawsuits by property owners. The Yuma Sun reports that the county Board of Supervisors decided last week to pursue adoption of an ordinance, with Supervisor Darren Simmons saying he agrees with the many constituents who have told him they want more regulation of outdoor lighting.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The City Council has passed an ordinance regulating the planting and maintenance of trees within the city’s parks, the first step on the road to getting Mountain Home recognized as a Tree City USA municipality. The Arbor Day Foundation’s Tree City USA program, co-sponsored by the National Association of State Foresters and the USDA Forest Service, recognizes communities for their forestry efforts. It includes more than 3,400 cities and military bases in all 50 states. The Arbor Day Foundation also awards matching grants to cities to perform forestry-related projects. The ordinance approved by the City Council last week creates a five-member tree board of Baxter County residents who will draft and administer a written plan for the preservation, planting and removal of trees.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVentura: Late summer in Ventura County means 12 days of agricultural displays, fried foods and head-spinning rides at the county fair. The Ventura County Fair begins Wednesday and runs daily through Aug.11. On Aug. 1, 5, 6 and 8, fairgoers can purchase $35 wristbands good for unlimited carnival rides until 7 p.m. Opening day Wednesday is Dollar Day, with admission just $1 until 3 p.m., and specialized discounts and free tickets for certain groups are available on several other days. Styx, Martina McBride and Melissa Etheridge are among performers scheduled to entertain fairgoers for free. More information is available online at www.venturacountyfair.org.\n\nColorado\n\nFrisco: Transportation officials say ridership on the state bus service is exceeding expectations as the service marked its fourth anniversary this month. The Summit Daily reports Bustang has recorded more than 238,000 riders in 2018-19, continuing to grow from the more than 102,000 riders recorded in the service’s first year. Bustang program manager Mike Timlin says the number of passengers has continued to outpace what the state Department of Transportation plans for each year. The service is planning more expansion, starting with weekend pilot routes in the fall from Denver to Estes Park and Rocky Mountain National Park. It aims to launch services to Pueblo and the Interstate 70 corridor in December. Timlin says Bustang also is recruiting resorts for seasonal direct routes to ski areas.\n\nConnecticut\n\nVernon: After worrying for years about the foundations crumbling beneath their houses, hundreds of suburban homeowners are getting help from the state to salvage their properties that had been doomed by bad batches of concrete. The homes are being lifted, propped up into the air and held there as workers jackhammer away concrete that had deteriorated due to the presence of a naturally occurring but corrosive mineral. New foundations are poured, and after six to eight weeks of work, the houses are ready to live in once again. This process is expected to continue for years. These feats, made possible by financial assistance from the state and a fee on homeowners’ insurance policies, are also rebuilding communities and the lives of residents, including some who’d considered just walking away from their houses and mortgages.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: New Castle County has been cracking down on tax-delinquent properties for much of the past year, but many parcels that owe the most in back taxes have not been the county’s priority. Not among the most-wanted tax scofflaws was Newark Country Club, which owes over $500,000 in property taxes, more than $400,000 of which is delinquent. Neither was an industrial automotive property in Wilmington’s Southbridge neighborhood, which last month owed $109,000. Nor was a shuttered Catholic church in Wilmington’s northside owned by a development partnership that owed about $90,000 until last week, when the liability was paid following questions from the Delaware News Journal.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After a D.C. summer jobs program was abruptly shut down, its former director says no one had discussed any complaints with him. The Washington Post reports the Amy Jacques Garvey Institute, which provided summer jobs for predominantly black teenagers and young adults, closed weeks ago to the surprise of Director Kendall Bryan. The Department of Employment Services told Bryan last week that his “inappropriate” remarks were causes for closure. He was accused of using foul language and making a youth described as the “only non-African American” enrollee uncomfortable after saying the program benefits black youth. Bryan said he may have used a profanity when breaking up a fight this year, but he dismissed the other allegation as “poppycock.” Officials said they would reassign enrollees.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A judge has struck down a state law that threatened city and county officials with penalties if they approved gun regulations tougher than state laws. Leon County Circuit Judge Charles Dodson said late Friday that lawmakers can prohibit local regulation of firearms, but penalizing local officials for passing stricter laws is unconstitutional. Florida has barred cities and counties from passing gun laws stricter than state laws since 1987, but lawmakers in 2011 approved penalties for local governments and officials, including fines of up to $5,000 and removal from office. Members of the public could receive damages up to $100,000 and attorney fees if they successfully sued. Local officials challenged the law in 2018 after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An African elephant that spent a decade at San Diego Zoo Safari Park has moved across the country to a new home at Zoo Atlanta. The Union-Tribune reports 30-year-old Msholo arrived last week at the Zambezi Elephant Center. Msholo and two female African elephants, Kelly and Tara, will be the main attractions at Zoo Atlanta’s new African Savanna habitat, which opens Aug. 8. Msholo was brought to the U.S. from Swaziland in 2003. He arrived in San Diego in 2009 with the hope that he would breed with female elephants there. But he never fathered any offspring in California. Zookeepers say they’re hopeful that new terrain and new companions in Georgia will increase Msholo’s chances of breeding and contributing to the survival of the species.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Protests against construction of a giant telescope have halted work at existing observatories on the Big Island. Hawaii News Now reported Sunday that workers at other facilities on the dormant Mauna Kea volcano have been denied access by demonstrators opposed to the Thirty Meter Telescope. Officials say 13 telescopes at the Mauna Kea Observatories have led to breakthroughs in astronomy for more than 40 years, including the first photo of a black hole and the discovery of the first interstellar object in space. Scientists say the two-week closure of the access road leading to the summit has resulted in the potential loss of a year’s worth of discoveries. Demonstrators oppose construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, which they say could further damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Mayor David Bieter says the city will not use facial recognition technology to identify people banned from City Hall after criticism over the plan. The Idaho Statesman reports Bieter’s office said Friday that the city will not proceed with a $31,000 contract with Meridian-based CompuNet that he had authorized. Lauren McLean, who is challenging Bieter in November, had said the decision to use the technology was a “step backward” and a disappointment for those who want more transparency from local elected officials. Bieter administration officials had argued that using the technology would act as a security measure for the public-facing employees at City Hall. No one is currently banned from City Hall.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Lincoln Park Zoo will remain free to all until mid-century under an agreement zoo operators reached with the city’s park district. The Lincoln Park Zoological Society, which operates the zoo, and the Chicago Park District, which owns the zoo’s land and buildings on the city’s North Side, extended their operating agreement to Dec. 31, 2049. Zoological society CEO Kevin Bell says keeping the zoo free is a great thing for the city and for people visiting Chicago. The zoo has its origins in 1868 with a gift of swans. With about 3.42 million visitors in 2018, Lincoln Park is by far the most popular of Chicago’s museums and nature parks. Of the others, only Shedd Aquarium and Brookfield Zoo approached the 2 million-visitor threshold last year.\n\nIndiana\n\nAlbany: Ten miles north of Muncie, a new 40-acre farm is busy with work day and night. What’s being grown there, though, isn’t what most would likely expect from Hoosier farm country. Just outside Albany, the gate-restricted, mostly inconspicuous facility owned by AquaBounty Technologies is one of few aquaculture farms in the state. Indoors, thousands of salmon swim within large, 70,000-gallon tanks. But a new, brimming batch of eggs is different from those already swimming around. Growing at twice the rate of wild salmon, these are the first genetically engineered animals deemed safe to eat by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Their existence in Indiana also marks the first time a genetically modified food animal will be raised and sold in the United States.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Public health officials are using online services like Tinder and Grindr to find and warn people who may have been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. “I have information that you may have been in contact with someone diagnosed as having a serious illness,” one of the standard messages reads. “It is very important you contact me to discuss this.” Shannon Wood, a disease intervention specialist for the Iowa Department of Public Health, often sends such messages via Facebook and other online services people use to meet each other. From 2010 to 2018, the number of Iowa chlamydia cases jumped 39%, to 14,685. Gonorrhea cases soared 168%, to 4,839, and syphilis cases went up 316%, to 283, the state health department reports. Last week, it warned that those rates continue to soar, with chlamydia cases climbing nearly 10% so far in 2019, and gonorrhea rates up nearly 15%.\n\nKansas\n\nAbilene: A museum honoring President Dwight Eisenhower in his childhood home has reopened after undergoing a massive, yearlong renovation. Visitors got their first glimpse Monday of modernized exhibits in the 25,000-square-foot museum. They feature new graphic panels, display cases, theater experiences and digital interactive stations. The original schedule was to open in time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day in early June, but the federal government shutdown delayed the timeline. During the work, museum exhibits were moved to the library portion of the 22-acre complex. It also includes the home in which the future president and supreme commander of the Allied forces during World War II spent most of his childhood. The formal dedication is planned for Oct. 12 to coincide with Ike’s birthday weekend.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Before classes begin, schools across the state are working to fulfill a new law requiring the national motto “In God We Trust” to be displayed in a prominent place. The Lexington Herald-Leader reports some districts, including Jessamine and Franklin, have put up plaques, while some, including Jefferson County Public Schools, plan to use artwork in common areas. Others, including Woodford County, are still working out details. Lead sponsor Republican Rep. Brandon Reed has said the motto is ever-present in society and is prominently displayed in the state Legislature. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill, saying the motto “has the appearance of endorsing religion.” ACLU Communications Director Amber Duke says parents or students who feel their rights have been violated should contact the organization.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new television show featuring local chef Isaac Toups is slated to launch this week. The show, dubbed “Kitchen Takeover,” will air on the Food Network and feature Toups traveling around the country and helping failing restaurants and food-related businesses to get back on track. In a news release, Toups invited people to watch the “big friendly Cajun try to help some good people out of some sticky situations.” The first show airs Saturday, Aug. 3. Toups is the chef and owner of Toups Meatery and Toups South. He also has a cookbook celebrating his love of the Cajun culture and cuisine of his childhood.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: It’s a slow lobster season so far, but fishermen are still hopeful it’ll be a good one. The harvest of crustaceans in America’s biggest lobstering state is usually in full swing by July, but fishermen say they haven’t caught much this month. The season tends to pick up after many lobsters shed their shells and reach legal size. Fishermen say that hasn’t happened yet. But the slow season isn’t resulting in high prices. Consumers are paying about what they did last year. The slow start also means a bait shortage hasn’t caused much worry. Maine typically accounts for about 80% of the nationwide lobster haul. Catches this decade have been much higher than any in the state’s history. The haul peaked at 132.6 million pounds in 2016 and nearly topped 120 million pounds last year.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: A gun rights advocacy group is challenging the state’s concealed carry gun laws. The Frederick News-Post reports that the lawsuit has been filed against the state’s Handgun Permit Review Board. A brief has been filed in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals contending that the state’s laws are unconstitutional and have been superseded by other case precedents. The brief was filed by Maryland Shall Issue, a gun rights organization. The Court of Special Appeals is Maryland’s intermediate appellate court. Under Maryland law, a state resident must provide a “good and substantial reason” to be granted a concealed carry permit. Maryland is one of 10 states considered a “may issue” state. That means it requires a permit to carry a concealed gun. Granting that permit is at the discretion of local authorities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: An association of black students at Harvard Law School says the university “woefully failed to act” after four students received offensive emails and text messages from an anonymous sender. The Harvard Black Law Students Association issued a statement Friday criticizing the school after it was unable to determine who sent the “hateful, racist and sexist” messages and after officials refused to share details of an investigation with students who received the messages. Four students, including two who are black, notified school officials this year that they had separately received messages with comments including “we all hate u,” “you know you don’t belong here” and “youre just here because of affirmative action.” Harvard officials say a variety of investigators have been unable to determine who was behind the messages.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society has discovered the remains of a ship that sank 103 years ago in Lake Superior off Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The society announced this month that it found the wreck of the 294-foot S.R. Kirby near the Keweenaw Peninsula last year. WWTV/WWUP-TV reports that Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum executive director Bruce Lynn says the Kirby left Ashland, Wisconsin, in calm weather on May 7, 1916. But the following day, as the vessel neared Eagle Harbor, the winds picked up to 76 mph. A huge wave took the Kirby down with 22 men aboard. Two men and the captain’s dog survived. Lynn says that the ship took about a minute to sink and that the wreck resembles an “explosion on the bottom of the lake.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Motorists will be required to use hands-free devices if they want to talk on the phone while driving. Slower drivers must move over to let faster drivers pass. Groping a person’s clothed buttocks without consent will become a crime. And vaping in public indoor spaces and workplaces will become as illegal as cigarette smoking in them. That’s just a sampling of the new laws that become effective Thursday in Minnesota. In other changes, residents of assisted living homes and their families will now have the right to install hidden monitoring cameras for two weeks before being required to notify the facilities. And certain parents who have lost their parental rights will have a little easier time trying to get them back.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Officials along the Mississippi Gulf Coast are reopening discussion of a new east-west connector linking the coast’s two largest cities. Local news outlets report Gulf Regional Planning Commission Executive Director Bill Gavin told business leaders it could cost more than $300 million to build a 12.6-mile, tree-lined parkway connecting Gulfport and Biloxi. The corridor would carry vehicles, include rapid bus service, offer a walking and bike path, and maybe have room for a light rail transit line. Gavin says the idea is to cut the project into segments, to make it more affordable. Plans call for building the road parallel to CSX railroad tracks, but not replacing them, as once was proposed following 2005’s Hurricane Katrina. The corridor could displace hundreds of businesses and residents. Gavin promises “epic public outreach.”\n\nMissouri\n\nEaston: Experts have begun restoring and re-erecting fallen headstones at a 150-year-old burial site. Tim Wiedmaier discovered the abandoned Kessler Cemetery in 2008 when he was searching for his great-great-great-grandfather’s headstone, which took him three tries. Community activist Mary Bray was one of the first helpers to clear away the brush and says she realized they needed professional help. The St. Joseph News-Press reports that Jacob’s Ladder Cemetery Restoration Specialists began refurbishing and standing up about 40 stone tablets a few days ago. There are 73 grave burials in the cemetery. The caretaker and treasurer for the old Kessler Cemetery, Michael Fisher, says he tried raising $9,000 for a complete revamp, but about $2,000 in donations is still needed to meet that goal.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: United Way is gearing up for its annual Stuff the Bus school supply drive Aug.8. Last year, the nonprofit gathered more than 15,000 items that were given to local kids through the school district and local nonprofits including Boys & Girls Club, the Children’s Receiving Home and the Rescue Mission. Businesses, churches, civic groups and families interested in gathering supplies ahead of the event can find supply lists, posters and other information on United Way’s website. Roughly 200 volunteers are needed to help sort donated items and to hand out school supply lists to shoppers. Volunteers can work one or more hourlong shifts. Interested volunteers should contact jbriggs@uwccmt.org. More information is available at www.volunteergreatfalls.org.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska Medical Center has received a five-year, $3.7 million grant to address the looming shortage of doctors who specialize in the care of older adults. The U.S. Health Resources Services Administration estimates a need for 33,200 geriatricians in the U.S. by 2025 – roughly 27,000 more than the current projected supply of about 6,200. The medical school says a way to solve the problem is to expand the access of primary care professionals to resources that aid them in treating older adults’ complex health issues. The grant will provide education to teams including physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, mental health professionals and social workers. The idea is to care for patients as a team when they’re sick but also keep them well.\n\nNevada\n\nSilver Springs: Crews have completed work to reinforce and preserve the historic adobe ruins of the state’s first and largest military outpost as part of a two-year effort to improve and expand the state park system. Fort Churchill was built in 1861 about 30 miles northeast of Carson City to provide protection for early settlers and guard Pony Express mail runs. It was abandoned in 1869. Then-Gov. Brian Sandoval announced in 2017 that more than $13 million would be devoted to an initiative to finance repairs and create two state parks. Park Supervisor Scott Egy told the Mason Valley News officials have been concerned about the deteriorating walls at the fort for 15 years but didn’t have any money for repairs. Thanks to the initiative, the work was completed in June.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMoultonborough: Two women plan to swim around an island in the Granite State to help raise money for loon conservation. Swimmers Brenda Gallagher and Pam Halsey are taking part in the second annual Winni Swim on Aug. 8. They will swim around Ragged Island to raise money for the Loon Preservation Committee’s work to protect loons in New Hampshire. Participants can register to swim or paddle along with the swimmers. After the swim, there will be a presentation on the history of loons on Lake Winnipesaukee and a guided tour of Ragged Island. The island swim is part of a larger goal that Gallagher and Halsey have of swimming around all 258 islands in Lake Winnipesaukee that don’t have bridges.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new state law will make the process more difficult for municipalities seeking changes in their form of government. NJ.com reports that the bill signed into law last week by Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver changes the minimum number of required voter signatures to replace a municipality’s form of government. Signatures for such measures must now constitute 25% of the total votes cast in the town during the last General Assembly election. Before, only 10% of the previous election votes were required. The measure also requires a supermajority, or two-thirds, of the governing body to approve placing the question on the ballot. The bill supersedes the Mount Laurel Township council’s effort to change from a partisan form to nonpartisan and move the election from November to May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A state commission’s decision may reopen private waterways to recreationists. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports the New Mexico Game Commission last week handed fishermen and other recreational boaters a partial victory by temporarily halting a program for private property owners. Under the 2017 program, private property owners have say over whether the public can access waterways on their land. The current commission, appointed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, decided Wednesday to impose a 90-day moratorium on the rule until it can receive advice from Attorney General Hector Balderas as to whether it is legal under state law. A previous commission, appointed by then-Gov. Susana Martinez, implemented a program in 2017 that allowed landowners to certify rivers and streams that cut through their property as “non-navigable.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The governor signed a bill Monday that softens penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana and allows for the expungement of some past offenses. The law changes an unlawful possession of marijuana statute into a violation that’s similar to a traffic ticket, instead of a criminal charge. Under the new law, the maximum penalty is $50 for possessing less than an ounce of pot and a maximum of $200 for between 1 and 2 ounces. The law also requires that records tied to low-level marijuana cases be automatically sealed and creates a process for expungement. It will take effect in 30 days. “Communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana for far too long, and today we are ending this injustice once and for all,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: The city will use federal grant money to help it inventory homes, churches and public buildings designed and built by African Americans. The News & Record reports Greensboro has received a $12,000 Historic Preservation Fund grant for the project. The city also is spending $10,000 on the project. City senior planner Mike Cowhig says state officials have suggested Greensboro do a comprehensive survey of buildings associated with African American designers and buildings because some communities are underrepresented in historic preservation. The city says the first phase will focus on modernist structures in eastern Greensboro and Benbow Park that were designed by African American architects. He says the city likely will survey the public for more information about historically significant buildings.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: A teenage visitor to a national park has been injured by a bison. Officials at Theodore Roosevelt National Park say the 17-year-old girl from Colorado was on a trail Saturday and walked between two bull bison that had been fighting. One bison charged the teen. She was struck in the back, gored in the thigh and tossed about 6 feet into the air. Park rangers and Billings County paramedics treated the girl at the scene until she could be taken by helicopter to a Bismarck hospital. Authorities say the teen’s condition is stable. Park regulations require that visitors stay at least 25 yards away from large animals such as bison, elk, deer and horses.\n\nOhio\n\nMiddletown: The Ron Howard-directed movie “Hillbilly Elegy” will film for a few days in this city where most of the book is set. The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reports Andy Lipschutz of the movie production company says some 125 people will be involved in shooting that begins Aug. 5 in Middletown. Local native J.D. Vance wrote the 2016 best-selling, colorful memoir about growing up in a struggling family. He was interviewed often that year for insights about white working-class people who supported Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Howard made multiple visits to the steel-mill city some 25 miles southwest of Dayton. Stars Glenn Close and Amy Adams were also spotted with him as he scouted locations for the Netflix movie, most of which is being filmed in Georgia.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials say that there is no longer a need to detain migrant children at an Army base in the state and that preparations to house them there have stopped. Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families, said in a news release Saturday that the decision to stop the preparations at Fort Sill was made because there has been a decrease in the number of unaccompanied migrant children coming into the U.S. Donelle Harder, a spokeswoman for Gov. Kevin Stitt, says the White House notified Stitt of the change but said Fort Sill could still be used if the number of children coming into the country rises again. The base about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City was used to house Japanese Americans during World War II and Apache prisoners of war from 1894 to 1910.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: Some local business owners say downtown events that close streets and parking are affecting their ability to do business, and they’re asking city officials to consider moving certain events. The Bend Bulletin reports restaurant owner Steven Draheim watched his sales diminish during the culinary street event “Bite of Bend.” Draheim got his own food truck and operated it two blocks from his brick-and-mortar business. But on a summer weekend, he would prefer that people come into his restaurant instead of food trucks in front of it. He says there’s a perception that events are bringing in more business, but they’re actually keeping people away. Event organizers say alternative spaces are hard to come by, and there’s value in bringing people together in the downtown core.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf is warning that food stamp benefits for about 200,000 people are jeopardized by a Trump administration move to stop allowing states to exceed federal income eligibility thresholds. Wolf said Monday that such a change would primarily affect the elderly, the disabled and lower-income families. He also says it’ll result in fewer school lunches. In Pennsylvania, more than 1.7 million people are in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Current federal guidelines forbid people who make more than 130% of the poverty level from getting food stamps. But most states bypass the limits under a federal policy that allows people who receive benefits through other government programs to automatically qualify for SNAP. The Trump administration seeks to end that policy.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is offering $4 million in grants to help communities and local groups protect open space. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management announced the availability of the grants Friday, through the Open Space Grant Program. The funding is provided through green economy bonds approved by voters in 2016 and 2018. The deadline to apply is Oct. 25. Gov. Gina Raimondo says preserving open spaces is critical to building resiliency against the impacts of climate change. Awards up to $400,000, which can cover up to half of the project cost, will help preserve lands offering significant natural, ecological or agricultural value through a direct purchase or conservation easement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFort Jackson: Recently released federal data shows that more than 16% of the drinking water wells tested near Fort Jackson over the past six years have shown contamination from a toxic chemical found in hand grenades used at the military installation to train soldiers. The State reports in some cases, the pollution levels are high enough to exceed federal safety advisories for RDX – a chemical that can cause seizures and cancer in people from long-term exposure. Fort Jackson officials say they’ve taken measures to prevent RDX from flowing toward private wells, including treating soil with lime to neutralize the chemical. In addition, the base has supplied bottled water and installed water filtration systems to keep it out of tap water.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Federal authorities say people who became sick after working at a uranium ore-buying station more than 60 years ago may qualify for compensation. The Rapid City Journal reports that workers who served at the station in Edgemont between 1952 and 1956 may have been exposed to toxic materials. Miners sold ore to the government during the Cold War for nuclear weapons. The federal Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation program is paying workers who fell sick from exposure to toxic materials and radiation. Surviving family members are eligible for compensation. The program has already paid $10.37 million to 120 South Dakota workers. It offers lump-sum payments of $150,000, plus medical expenses, or people can qualify for a cap of $250,000 for wage losses, impairment benefits and medical expenses.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A prosecutor who has come under fire for making anti-gay remarks now faces calls to have his law license immediately suspended. A coalition of Tennessee attorneys submitted the letter Monday, asking that Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott’s competency to practice law be investigated and that he be required to reaffirm his oath as an attorney. A complaint was filed against Northcott earlier this year after video footage surfaced of him saying gay couples shouldn’t receive domestic violence protections, arguing that such laws are designed to protect the “sanctity of marriage.” Northcott has since argued that he has “strongly held religious beliefs” that same-sex relationships are sinful and will not do anything to suggest he agrees “with such behavior.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: No cash? No problem. The city is launching a pilot program that will let fans digitally tip their favorite musicians. The Austin American-Statesman reports the city is providing 10 artists with a DipJar, a device that enables fans to tip musicians using a credit or debit card. The chosen artists will test the technology for six months. They can collect tips at local live shows or on tour. City officials say they hope the program will financially help local musicians and the city, which draws visitors due in part to its internationally known music scene. Mat Oldiges, leader of the Human Circuit, one of the groups selected, says while tips are fewer than before, he believes fans still want to help artists but may “just need that little extra motivation and access.”\n\nUtah\n\nPark City: Olympic Park has announced an $11 million expansion to renovate training facilities and strengthen the state’s bid to host a second Winter Olympics. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that officials said at a groundbreaking ceremony last Tuesday that the project will add as many 10 new ski runs over the next five years, including some that will be world class level. The changes at the Park City site are part of a series of improvements in the works and planned at facilities used in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation CEO Colin Hilton said the improvements will also help recruit people who want to learn how to ski and snowboard. Salt Lake City is hoping to be selected to host the 2030 Winter Olympics.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A group working to bring high-speed internet services to the state’s most remote region says two communications districts could be set up in the coming years to provide that service. The Caledonian Record reports the plan would create a communications district that would allow towns to share services. Any financial liability would be placed on the district rather than any one municipality. The plan by the Northeast Kingdom Collaborative builds on discussions at a June meeting on broadband issues. Northeast Kingdom Collaborative Director Katherine Sims says a draft map for the districts covers 55 cities and towns, with 24 in Caledonia County and the rest in the counties of Essex and Orleans. The Northeast Kingdom’s three counties have some of the lowest availability of high-speed broadband in the state.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Monroe: The state’s Department of Historic Resources is backing an alternative to Gov. Ralph Northam’s call to take down a 1950s-era archway honoring the president of the Confederacy. The preservation officer at Fort Monroe says that instead, just the letters reading “Jefferson Davis Memorial Park” should be removed from the arch at the historic U.S. Army site. The Virginian-Pilot reports David Stroud would move the letters into the fort’s Casemate Museum, and contextual signage could explain their history. The arch was installed in 1956 at the request of the Daughters of the Confederacy. Davis was briefly imprisoned at the fort after surrendering during the Civil War. The site also marks where John Smith landed on the James River in 1607 and where the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: An alliance of food trucks is offering free meals this summer to homeless students who normally rely on free and reduced-price school lunches during the school year. The Spokesman Review reports the pilot program gives free meals to 58 homeless students who use punch cards for food at the trucks during the 11-week summer break. Students can get up to five hot meals a week – or 55 total – over the summer at any of more than 30 participating food trucks. Forty-five of the students also got bus passes to travel to the food trucks’ locations. Food truck owners are donating the cost of a meal, typically priced at $10 or $11. Many of the students are living on the streets without their parents.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Members of mine rescue teams from across the country will be in the Mountain State this week to compete in readiness tests. West Virginia University says the National Mine Rescue Association Post 5 contest will begin Tuesday and run through Thursday at Mylan Park in Morgantown. Competing will be representatives from 20 mine rescue teams. The competitions will include mine rescue, first aid, pre-shift and bench. Representatives from mining regulatory agencies representing West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and federal personnel will judge the teams.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the Wisconsin Assembly will not allow a paralyzed Democratic lawmaker who is in a wheelchair to phone into committee meetings. Rep. Jimmy Anderson, of Fitchburg, says enforcing the legislative rule keeps him from performing his job as well as he should. Anderson says the rule discriminates against him because he has difficulty getting to some meetings because of health reasons. But Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is unwilling to change the rule. “I think it’s disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone when individuals are actually taking the time out of their day to come and testify in person,” Vos says. Anderson says it’s “absolutely ridiculous” to say accommodating someone with a disability would somehow be disrespectful to people.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The state Game and Fish Commission has approved spending $1.25 million to help pay for two wildlife underpasses along U.S. Highway 189 in western Wyoming to reduce the number of collisions between vehicles and mule deer. Wyoming Public Media reports the Department of Transportation and other organizations are also funding the project along a 5-mile stretch of highway north of LaBarge. Game and Fish spokeswoman Sara DiRienzo says the two underpasses and associated fencing are the first phase of a project that aims to reduce wildlife collisions along a 28-mile stretch of the road. The road intersects an area where mule deer cross in the fall and spring traveling to and from their winter range. The agency expects the underpasses will reduce collisions by up to 90%. The projects are expected to be completed by 2022.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/21/putin-declares-victory-mariupol-ukraine/7397863001/", "title": "Putin's claims victory in Mariupol.

And listen to Greg Tish’s morning show on Real Talk 93.3 where we'll discuss the legacy of these history makers.\n\nThe only condition is that those featured below must be deceased. Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 100 names.\n\nJustice James Diament Westcott, Jr. (1839 - 1887)\n\nTallahassee born James Diament Westcott III, who preferred “Junior” rather than James the Third, had a knack for law and politics.\n\nBy the age of 28, Westcott served as the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate, the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry, and as a captain in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the war he was elected as a Leon County representative to the Florida House.\n\nThe year he turned 30, he was elected attorney general. It was a remarkable feat because Westcott ran as a Democrat in the year a new Florida Constitution gave voting rights to freed slaves who registered as Republicans and the GOP won in landslides up and down the ballot.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the election Republican Gov. Harrison Reed appointed Westcott to the Florida Supreme Court, making him the youngest justice in Florida history.\n\nHe would serve for 17 years and would write 267 opinions – the most in Florida history.\n\nWestcott received his entire academic education at West Florida Seminary – which would become Florida State University, for which he was eternally grateful.\n\nUpon his death, he left his entire estate to West Florida Seminary. The principal would produce about $69,000 annually.\n\nThat was enough to provide a financial lifeline for the struggling institution – the stability needed for the school to evolve into a state-supported university. Today, a portion of the proceeds goes toward financial assistance for low-income students.\n\nWestcott died in 1887 and is buried in Tallahassee’s Old City Cemetery. In 1936, Florida State University named its administration building in his honor.\n\nGilbert Chandler (1889 - 1978)\n\nIn 1925, a Minnesota asparagus farmer was disappointed when he stopped for a night in Tallahassee – he found no place to stay, not even space to pitch a tent.\n\nThe disappointment would lead Gilbert Chandler to build a Tallahassee landmark, The Cottages of Lake Ella.\n\nChandler had $2,000 in his pocket when he ventured out of the land of lakes to seek his fortune as a “Tin Can Tourist,” the nickname for motorists touring the countryside at the dawn of the auto age.\n\nIn California, he stayed at an “auto camp,” cottages furnished with a bench, table and electric light.\n\nChandler told Susan Poplin for a Florida State University history thesis that the two-room cabins cost $750 to build and produced a 400% annual profit.\n\nChandler considered himself a Horatio Alger up-from-the-bootstrap character and after a quick look around a tiny state capital city that would soon be located at the intersection of two proposed U.S. highways (27 & 90), he decided to stay and pioneer auto camping in Florida.\n\nFirst, he paid $400 for some lots along the railroad tracks on Gaines Street. He built 10 cabins and a communal washroom and charged $1 a night to stay.\n\nTwo years later, he bought five acres north of town and built the Tallahassee Tourist Camp along a dirt road at Lake Ella. Once the road was paved and became U.S. 27, he expanded his camp with the Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of the highway and the Lake Ella Motor Court on the east side.\n\nThe motor court consisted of 15 cottages. They were converted into apartments during a World War II housing shortage and rented for $30 a month.\n\nChandler used the money to upgrade the cottages with carpets, steam heat and the latest innovations. At war’s end and a tourism boom underway, Chandler promoted the Lake Ella Motor Court with hand-made billboards across the southeast.\n\nHe posted 4-by-8 feet red and yellow silkscreen painted signs advertising a motor court on the shore of Tallahassee's “beautiful Lake Ella,” every 10 miles on roads leading into and out of Birmingham, Atlanta, Daytona Beach, Tampa and the panhandle.\n\nOne night while out posting signs, “Dad called home to ask about business and Mom said they were full. People told her they’d been following the signs for hundreds of miles just to stop for the night,” Gilbert Chandler Jr., told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Andy Lindstrom in 1995 for a history of the Lake Ella cottages.\n\nAfter Gilbert Chandler passed, his heirs retired from the hospitality business. What had grown into the 92-room Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of Monroe was torn down in the 1990s to make room for a Golden Corral restaurant.\n\nAcross the street, 11 of the original 15 cottages still stand, converted into specialty shops for the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTheir once white trim now is blue and grey, the multi-colored shingles replaced with brown ones, but they still sport marble facades. It is said, when a ton of marble was accidentally delivered to Tallahassee, Chandler bought it for a bargain to spruce up his cottages.\n\nChandler was a World War I veteran, Free Mason, and a Shriner who built an iconic Tallahassee destination after a disappointing first night in town.\n\nAquilina Howell (1917 - 2000)\n\nAquilina Howell was born on West Georgia Street and would go on to spend 42 years working in Leon County schools as a teacher and administrator.\n\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nHowell was the first woman to serve as an Assistant Superintendent in Leon County and is credited as the driving force behind the peaceful desegregation of Tallahassee's public schools\n\n“Aquilina had unbelievable processing skills,\" said former school superintendent Charles Couch who appointed her assistant superintendent. “She could take angry people, get them to look at the issues calmly, and solve the problem in win-win fashion for everyone.”\n\nCouch, and others, recall how Howell led Leon schools during desegregation without the discord and violence that plagued other communities.\n\n“She could always make you calm down and see the other person’s point and make you think you did all the solving,” her sister Lucille Alexander told Gerald Ensley at Howell’s passing. “I used to say to her, ‘All right, Mr. Ralph Bunche.’” (Bunche was the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize.)\n\nHowell was married for 51 years to Tallahassee insurance agent Sam Howell, who passed in 1994. Howell died in 2000.\n\nThe Taylor House, where she was born, is now a museum celebrating Frenchtown and the Tallahassee Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn recognition of the path, she set a path for educators, civil activists, and community leaders, supporters created the Aquilina C. Howell Education Scholarship at Florida A&M University for first- and second-year students who graduated from a Leon County high school.\n\nAnd Howell’s name can still be spotted around town; including the Leon County schools administrative building on West Pensacola Street, and the Carter-Howell-Strong Park in Frenchtown.\n\nCarrie Meek (1926 - 2021)\n\nCarrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper’s daughter as a child, was not allowed to enter the Florida State Capitol because she was Black.\n\nAs a 12-year-old Girl Scout, Meek was blocked at the front door when white members of her Girl Scout Troop delivered home-made brownies to Florida lawmakers. As a Lincoln High School and Florida A&M University graduate, she would be the first Black woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction.\n\nWillie and Carrie Pittman’s daughter broke many racial, gender, and educational barriers.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with the Washington Post, she recalled in Jim Crow Tallahassee there weren’t any decent recreational facilities for Black people, and because she was Black, she couldn’t try on shoes in stores or pursue a master’s degree in her hometown.\n\nMeek earned a Master of Science at the University of Michigan after being awarded a B.S. in biology at FAMU in 1948, and after a career as a South Florida educator she would win a 1979 special election to represent Miami in the Florida House.\n\nIn 1982, she became the first Black woman elected to the Florida Senate.\n\nAs a politician, Meek was an unapologetic Democrat firebrand with an agenda rooted in the inequities she lived and witnessed.\n\nShe is remembered as an advocate for minorities, immigrants, and the working poor. And as someone who routinely intensified the debate.\n\nIn Tallahassee when Meek wanted to kill a bill, she would stand on the floor and wave a black flag of death adorned with a skull and crossbones.\n\nIn 1994, Meek provoked a massive argument with new Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She chided Gingrich for negotiating a multi-million-dollar book deal with a publishing company that had a stake in telecommunications legislation.\n\nMeek said Gingrich stood “to make a whole lot of dust” from the deal.\n\nRepublicans struck Meek’s comments from the Congressional Record. The argument that followed dominated the coverage of the New York Times, Washington Post, and the television news networks.\n\n“The only thing missing up here is my black flag,” Meek told the Miami Herald at the time.\n\nCarrie Meek never lost an election. She retired from politics in 2002.\n\nThe Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is co-named in Meek's honor.\n\nHenry Livingston Rutgers (1810 - 1861)\n\nIn 1836, Henry Livingston Rutgers, direct kin of the namesake of Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, married Jane Barnwall and the two moved to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida Territorial Gov. William P. Duval had appointed Henry the Territorial Administrator and Treasurer.\n\nRutgers would go on to serve the territory and city for more than two decades. And although he was an early and apparently prominent settler, little is written about him.\n\nIn 1845, Rutgers cast a vote as an elector for the first Florida State Governor, William Dunn Moseley.\n\nRutgers also served two terms on the Tallahassee City Council and Circuit Court Judge Jesse J. Finely appointed him as an investigator in the renowned Croom-Smith Case of 1857 – which decided ownership of Goodwood Plantation’s 200 enslaved workers.\n\nIn 1856, the Floridian and Journal newspaper, according to the Tallahassee Heritage Foundation, reported the opening of a new state bank on Monroe Street, to which the paper added, \"We are indebted to Mr. H. L. Rutgers.\"\n\nThe Foundation suggests that druggist B. C. Lewis, who opened his own bank that year had bought the building from Rutgers.\n\nRutgers hired freedman George Proctor to build him two homes in Tallahassee – the Randall-Lewis House at 424 North Calhoun St., and the Rutgers House across Calhoun and now the Tallahassee Garden Center.\n\nIt was in a cabin on Rutgers’ Calhoun St property where Antonio Proctor, the scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city, would pass in 1855.\n\nFredrich R. Cotten (1819 - 1878)\n\nFredrich R. Cotten had big plans for Florida when he came to Tallahassee in 1845. He got himself elected to the first Florida House of Representatives and then he developed a vast section of land that is today upper-middle class neighborhoods in north, northwest Tallahassee into the second largest cotton plantation in Leon County.\n\nSixty years later his grandson, Fred Cotten Elliot, would have even bigger land use plans.\n\nHe would try to drain the Everglades.\n\nBy 1850, Virginian Fredrich R. Cotten had transformed a wide swath of what is now north Tallahassee and west Leon County into a $12 million – in today's money – cotton growing operation.\n\nThat land today is a collection of upper middle class subdivisions, a country club, and Lake Jackson boat landings.\n\nCotten’s Burgesstown Plantation took in more than 8,000 acres from the Ochlocknee River and Lake Iamonia south to the Luna Pines neighborhood, east through Phipps-Overstreet Park and the eastern shore of Lake Jackson to Miller's Landing, then north to Golden Eagle Plantation, and Killearn Lakes Plantation.\n\nAccounting records indicate that shipments of cotton went regularly from Burgesstown via St. Marks to New York with proceeds credited to Cotten.\n\nThe Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows Cotten was the single largest slaveholder in the county, with 275 enslaved workers.\n\nWhen Cotten passed in 1878, he was buried at Saint John's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\n\nCotten's heirs would sell Burgesstown to Lloyd Griscom of Philadelphia who in 1901 converted the land into a quail hunting plantation. Griscom’s son, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, would purchase the Tallahassee Democrat in 1929 and the family would own the paper until 1965.\n\nCotten's grandson Fred Cotten Elliot became the state's chief civil engineer at the Internal Improvement Fund, now the Department of Environmental Protection. In 1913, Elliot developed a plan and directed an effort to drain the Everglades to create farmland.\n\nElliot joined a team of eight that hack through sawgrass to clear a path for barges, and he designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades.\n\nWhen he got back home after his Everglades adventure, Elliot laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course.\n\nThe state-owned Elliot Building, on the SE corner of Pensacola and Monroe, across from the Capitol was named for him. It is scheduled to be demolished and the site will become a Memorial Park, whose purpose is to honor Florida history and commemorate victims of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nJayleen Woods (1934 - 2006)\n\nIn 1972, Jayleen Woods was included in a Tallahassee Democrat story about women who had “invaded” “men only” professions like public relations managers, commonly referred to as \"spokesmen\" by the media.\n\nWoods was a wordsmith. She was a writer and editor for the Florida Flambeau, Tallahassee Democrat and Tampa Tribune. Woods also worked 17 years as the Director of Information Services at Florida State University, where she served as the university’s spokesperson, and later as the editor of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association magazine for 30 years.\n\nWoods said she had “printer’s ink in her veins.”\n\nShe got a big infusion of it after a poem she wrote as a 12-year-old, about a volunteer group called The Red Feathers, appeared on the front page of her hometown newspaper in Bristol, CT.\n\nFive years later, she accepted a writing scholarship to Florida State University, where she would become a member of the Flying High Circus and edit the student newspaper the Florida Flambeau.\n\nAfter graduating from FSU, Woods took a job with the Tampa Tribune and then met Tom Woods of Tallahassee. That would lead to a move back to the Capital City and Woods breaking glass ceilings as she moved into management positions that previously were a male domain.\n\nTom and Jayleen were married for 48 years and had two daughters. He preceded her in death.\n\nIn retirement, Jayleen created fund-raising brochures for the Girl Scout Council and its Apalachee Camp for All Seasons. She also remained active with the League of Women Voters, Springtime Tallahassee, the Women’s Club of Tallahassee, and the Seminole Boosters.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker (1844 - 1903)\n\nA native of British Sierra Leon, Thomas DeSaille Tucker was a lawyer and missionary who became the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which became Florida A&M University.\n\nHe was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio and taught at schools for emancipated slaves in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law office in Pensacola.\n\nTucker devoted his life to combatting slavery, according to a Oberlin College biography.\n\n\"The colored men in this country have no voice in the general government; even in some of the States they have no voice in the State government,\" he wrote to a friend in Africa. \"It would fairly sicken you to be here on a fourth of July and hear guns firing and 'starspangled banner' waving 'over the land of the free and the home of the brave' while there are this day 4,000,000 of slaves in their possession. O what a hypocrisy. God will not always sleep but will yet come in judgment against this country except they speedily repent.\"\n\nIn 1887, Tucker accepted appointment as the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in DeFuniak Springs. With an infusion of federal money, Tucker moved the school to Tallahassee onto property once owned by Gov. Willliam Duval.\n\nWhen the State Board of Education selected Tucker to be the school’s first president, the editor of a local newspaper wrote:\n\n“We have known Professor Tucker for about 18 years and we have never met a more genial, broadminded and sterling gentleman. He possesses first-class qualities as a friend, gentleman and scholar, and commands the respect of all who know him. He is a strong man, morally and intellectually, and the new Normal has a security of success under his charge.”\n\nTucker served as president until an argument with William N. Sheats over the school’s direction. Sheats wanted Tucker to focus on agricultural and industrial education, Tucker insisted on a liberal arts education.\n\nSheats was appointed Superintendent in 1895 and slowly reduced Tucker’s authority and reduced the school’s budget and questioned spending until Tucker was finally ousted in 1901.\n\nTucker moved to Jacksonville where he practiced law until his death in 1903.\n\nThe Sims; Robert (1924 - 1966), Helen (1932 - 1966), Joy (1954 - 1966)\n\nThree members of the Sims family are the victims in a story that local lore holds as the moment Tallahassee lost its innocence.\n\nOctober 22, 1966, was a football Saturday and that night 30,000 people, more than half of the city’s population, attended the Mississippi State University vs. Florida State University football game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nRobert Sims, the director of data processing for the Department of Education, Helen Sims, a former secretary for First Baptist Church, and their 12-year-old daughter Joy did not.\n\nVicious killers invaded their home in a quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood and the three were found bound, gagged and shot shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nRobert and Joy passed at the scene. Helen was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness to provide any clues to the killers. She died nine days later.\n\nSixteen-year-old ambulance attendant Rocky Bevis was among the first responders to the crime scene. He cut the bonds on all three victims at their ankles and wrists.\n\n\"We just woke up one morning in Tallahassee and we were part of an evil world,” he recalled to the Miami Herald for a story marking the 50th anniversary of the crime.\n\nBefore that October night, Tallahassee was a place where people did not lock their doors.\n\nBut as word of the murders spread, homes started to be kept locked at all hours, doors not opened to strangers, shades were drawn at dusk. And when no arrests were made, people bought watchdogs, hardware stores ran out of locks and safety door chains, and there was a rush at gun shops.\n\nFear spread through the city to the extent that Trick or Treat was cancelled that Halloween.\n\nA Tallahassee Democrat editorial stated, “This is no night to send young children in masks and costumes into the street.”\n\nA $16,000 reward was never collected. The murder weapons were never found. A motive never established.\n\nSheriff deputies had two suspects in their sights, and nearly 1,000 fingerprints collected at the scene but never secured enough evidence to bring any charges.\n\nThe late Leon County Sheriff Larry Campbell investigated the murders as a deputy and continued to probe the case through a 53-year law enforcement career.\n\n“I’ve done everything I think I can do,” he told the Miami Herald in 2006. “The big frustration is that I feel very confident that I know who did it.”\n\nThe case remains unsolved. Campbell passed in 2014.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues: Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/03/list-most-endangered-us-sites-helps-preservation/73504708007/", "title": "US historic sites in danger could get boost from national honor", "text": "To the casual visitor, Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo district might appear to be the thriving, downtown heart of the city’s Japanese American population, rife with boutique shops and cafes offering ramen, mochi and Japanese bar snacks.\n\nBut early this year, when skyrocketing rent prices forced the closing of the venerable Suehiro Cafe, a neighborhood fixture since 1972, it was another sign to longtime observers of the slow erosion peeling away the identity of one of the country’s last remaining Japantowns.\n\nNow, Little Tokyo is among the places named to the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s annual list of America’s 11 most endangered historic sites, a distinction advocates hope can bring the attention and support necessary to preserve the site and prompt locally influenced development that maintains its character.\n\n“It really underscores that Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo is a place that matters while recognizing the threats this neighborhood has been facing,” said Kristen Hayashi, director of collections for the district’s Japanese American National Museum, which opened there in 1992.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation’s annual list, now in its 37th year, looks to highlight sites with historic significance, a definition encompassing more than just the homes and landmarks linked to American founders or political and military leaders.\n\n“Our aim is to map out a commemorative and historic landscape in this country that honors the achievements of all Americans,” said Carol Quillen, the trust’s president and CEO. “The stories those sites hold matter and help us understand who we are as a people – and who we can become.”\n\nThis year’s sites include Eatonville, Florida, among the first self-governing, all-Black municipalities in the U.S.; New Salem Baptist Church in the former Black coal camp community of Tams, Virginia; Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana; and St. Croix’s Estate Whim Museum in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nQuillen said that in compiling the list, her team looked for sites of historical significance facing imminent challenges while considering the level of local commitment and the suggestions advocates have recommended for moving forward.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Hayashi said Little Tokyo is the city’s second oldest ethnic neighborhood, a central part of the local Japanese American community for more than a century. This year marks its 140th anniversary, dating to the opening of the neighborhood’s first Japanese-owned business.\n\nThreats have faced the community before; the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II turned Little Tokyo into a virtual ghost town gradually claimed by Black Americans who came to the area to work in the war industry, Hayashi said. With the war’s end, it was revived as a safe haven to help Japanese community members get back on their feet.\n\nDespite some movement into the suburbs, “this area remains the hub where Japanese people come to dine, to shop, to worship and to attend cultural activities,” she said.\n\nBut more recently, she added, transit construction and eminent domain actions have disrupted daily life and brought gentrification, and longtime small business owners have faced rising pressures as a result.\n\nIn that sense, Little Tokyo is emblematic of other sites on the list; along with threats of development, they face threats ranging from decay and neglect to structural issues posed by changing weather patterns.\n\nEndangered sites face encroaching development\n\nQuillen said most sites are not opposed to development. They just want a more thoughtful approach.\n\nFor instance, in Gary, Indiana, a coalition of local organizations is working to restore Roosevelt High, which opened in 1930 to serve Black Americans. The school, whose alumni include athletes, actors and members of The Jackson 5, has been unoccupied and deteriorating for several years, according to the national trust.\n\n“What that group wants to do is retrofit and repurpose the building for uses that the community itself will determine,” Quillen said. “Our hope is to enable the solutions that the community wishes to see happen.”\n\nAnother example is the community of Eatonville, Florida, most commonly known among literary enthusiasts as the longtime home of African American novelist Zora Neale Hurston, who set many of her narratives there.\n\n“Zora Neale Hurston and Eatonville are two sides of the same hand, because she includes Eatonville in so much of what she writes,” said N.Y. Nathiri, executive director of The Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community.\n\nEatonville was also home to the Hungerford School, a school for Black students modeled after the Tuskegee Institute and at one time comprising more than half the town’s geography. Educator and author Booker T. Washington once cited the community as a model of African American advancement, Nathiri said.\n\nNow, the town faces challenges from developers eager to cash in on the largest undeveloped parcel of land in Florida’s Orange County, six miles north of downtown Orlando.\n\n“When people are looking to develop and you are sitting on prime real estate, you are a target,” Nathiri said.\n\nNathiri said community revitalization advocates hope to nurture investment and community-driven development that preserves the area’s history while allowing Eatonville to become a hub of cultural heritage tourism.\n\n“We are at a very important juncture,” she said.\n\nInclusion on list can galvanize preservation efforts\n\nFor sites on the list, Quillen said, the selection can draw attention from philanthropists, elected officials who can push needed policy changes and developers interested in working in cooperation with communities.\n\n“We’ve had good success,” Quillen said, noting only a handful of the 350-plus sites featured throughout the program’s history have failed to survive. “The list is an effective mechanism for generating the resources that these places need to realize their plans.”\n\nThat’s what community advocates are hoping for in Tams, a once-thriving Black coal camp in isolated, rural West Virginia, where the New Salem Baptist Church remains its lingering vestige.\n\nTrustees of the African American Baptist congregation approached the owner of the fledgling town, formed in 1908, about building a house of worship. The church, erected in 1921, is among the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s 2024 selectees.\n\nDanielle Parker, executive director of the Preservation Alliance of West Virginia, said the designation highlights the African American experience in twentieth-century Appalachian coal mines, a story typically underrepresented in national historic preservation efforts. More than a quarter of Appalachian mine workers in 1920 were Black, she said.\n\nWith its early 20th-century Gothic Revival-style architecture, including lancet-arched windows and ornately carved pews, the church became a town centerpiece, hosting Sunday school for local children and occasional community dinners and summer picnics.\n\nThe coal mine shut down in 1955 and its related camp structures were demolished, Parker said, and while the church remained, it has since fallen into disrepair. Community advocates have raised funds to address the needs, but it hasn’t been enough.\n\n“Though the Church has stood for over 100 years and community support for its preservation is very strong, the building needs more upkeep and repairs than the small congregation can currently handle,” she said.\n\nParker hopes the national recognition can help church preservationists connect with people whose families lived and worked in Tams during its coal camp heyday. By spotlighting the little-known history of Black coal miners, she said, it could also bring more tourism to the area and highlight the working-class legacy of those whose coal-producing work helped create modern America.\n\nOther selectees for 2024 include a Civil War battlefield in Virginia, a lighthouse in New York and the Tangier American Legation in Morocco, which became the first American public property located abroad after being gifted to the U.S. by the Moroccan Sultan in 1821.\n\nReimagining the past for the present\n\nIn Los Angeles, Hayashi said Little Tokyo's inclusion on this year's list will allow district preservationists to tap the network of previously named sites – notably two of last year’s selectees, Philadelphia Chinatown and Seattle Chinatown-International District – for guidance about how best to proceed.\n\nEfforts are underway to promote local ownership and mixed-use projects favoring legacy businesses. Ideally, she said, Suehiro Café, the cherished community restaurant that two Japanese sisters opened more than a half-century ago before it closed in January, could make a return.\n\n“They’re imagining a Little Tokyo that is vibrant and surviving and serving people in the present,” Quillen said. “They don’t want to dip it in amber…. Our job is to hold up the efforts of these communities and help them attract attention.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/21/us/five-things-august-21-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on August 21, 2022: Start your week smart: Voting ...", "text": "Pedestrians accustomed to the hum of a passing Tesla will be in for a shock when a new electric vehicle hits the streets.

DeSimone, an associate professor of Russian and Eastern European history at Utica University in New York.\n\n“All of this is illogical, and that’s the scary thing,” he says. “This is not normal for what he’s done in the past. This is something that makes no sense on many levels, and not just in regard to World War II.”\n\nThere are, of course, significant differences between the current war in Ukraine and the clash between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Nazi war machine was formidable, agile, and well-trained. The Wehrmacht killed and wounded 150,000 Red Army soldiers in the first week of their invasion in June of 1941. They seized vast swaths of territory, and in one “mega-encirclement” trapped four Soviet armies, capturing 700,000 prisoners of war.\n\nSoviet soldiers fighting in the streets of Stalingrad in October 1942. PhotoQuest/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nAnd there is no moral equivalence between Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nStalin was a sociopath (he once reached into a cage and killed a family pet parrot because its chirping annoyed him) who starved millions of Ukrainians to death and routinely murdered political rivals. Zelensky is a democratically elected leader who has rallied Ukrainians and inspired the world with his conspicuous displays of courage and eloquent defense of democracy.\n\nBut look closer at Putin’s struggles in Ukraine and ironic parallels emerge. Military historians say Putin is following Hitler’s ill-fated playbook in at least three areas.\n\nPutin forgot a basic rule of warfare\n\nThe tank has long struck dread in enemy troops. When the British introduced the first lumbering tanks during World War I, soldiers fled in terror.\n\nUkraine, though, has become, according to one recent headline, a “graveyard for Russian tanks.” Ukrainian soldiers are using everything from drones to Javelins to destroy tank convoys.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Structured ambush': Video appears to show strike on Russian tanks 01:40 - Source: CNN 'Structured ambush': Video appears to show strike on Russian tanks 01:40\n\nBut Russian tanks have been stymied for another surprising reason: lack of fuel. The lack of fuel is part of a bigger problem. The once-vaunted Russian army has become bogged down in Ukraine not just because of fierce resistance but by something more prosaic: logistics.\n\nSmoke rises from a destroyed Russian tank on the side of a road in the Lugansk region of Ukraine on February 26, 2022. ANATOLII STEPANOV/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPutin has struggled to feed, fuel and equip his army. There have been reports of Russian troops looting banks and supermarkets, tanks running out of fuel, and soldiers using substandard forms of military communication – like smartphones – that have contributed to what Ukraine says are the deaths of at least seven Russian generals.\n\n“The evidence suggests that Putin thought he could win a quick victory with the deployment of special forces and airborne units,” says Ian Ona Johnson, a professor of military history at the University of Notre Dame. “So when they were forced to go to a much more traditional war involving essentially most of the Russian army along the Ukrainian border, they weren’t prepared for some of the logistics.”\n\nPoor logistical planning also played a critical role in Nazi Germany’s defeat on the Eastern front, where Hitler expected a quick victory.\n\nThe German army failed to set up sufficient supply lines for the vast distances and harsh terrain of the Soviet Union. German tanks ran out of fuel. The consequences of this poor logistical planning would prove fatal when the Russian winter hit.\n\nHitler didn’t equip many of his soldiers with winter clothing because he thought the Soviet army was so inferior. German soldiers were forced to fight in freezing temperatures while still clad in their summer uniforms, with some using newspaper and straw to shield themselves against the cold.\n\n“This proved devastating when a particularly brutal Russian winter set in,” Johnson says. “Something like 250,000 German soldiers eventually suffered frostbite injuries or died from the cold that winter because of logistical issues.”\n\nUkrainian soldiers patrol next to a destroyed Russian tank in the village of Lukianivka near Kyiv on March 30, 2022. Ronaldo Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe German army reached its lowest point at the battle of Stalingrad, considered the turning point of World War II. There ill-equipped German soldiers were forced to eat horses, dogs and rats to survive the winter.\n\nThe scale of the fighting in Ukraine today doesn’t approach the Eastern Front, but the lesson from both wars can be summed up in a military maxim attributed to Gen. Omar Bradley, an American general during World War II:\n\n“Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics.”\n\nHe alienated potential allies\n\nIn a war already full of heartbreaking images, one photo may be the worst.\n\nIt is a haunting photo of a pregnant Ukrainian woman in torn clothes being carried on a stretcher. The woman is conscious, her hand cradled protectively over her bare womb, which is smeared with blood. Both she and her baby would later die from her injuries. Ukrainian authorities say she was in a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol when it was shelled by Russian artillery.\n\nThe image underscored what some commentators now say is Putin’s standard approach to war: He is indiscriminately killing civilians to break the will of the Ukrainian people.\n\nA Ukrainian woman near a block of apartment buildings destroyed in the besieged port city of Mariupol on March 17, 2022. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nRussia’s army has been accused of bombing hospitals, shopping malls, apartment buildings and a theater with the word “children” written in Russian on the exterior of the building. Russia also been accused of trying to starve a Ukrainian city into submission by blocking humanitarian relief.\n\nThe Russian army’s brutality, though, is having the opposite effect, Maria Varenikova wrote from Lviv, Ukraine, in a recent article for the New York Times.\n\n“If there is one overriding emotion gripping Ukraine right now, it is hate,” Varenikova said. “It is a deep, seething bitterness for President Vladimir V. Putin, his military, and his government.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN investigation reveals details of Russian strike on hospital 03:42 - Source: CNN CNN investigation reveals details of Russian strike on hospital 03:42\n\nBrutality can backfire in war.\n\nPutin has potential allies in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are two Slavic nations that share religious and cultural ties. Many Ukrainians have relatives in Russia and speak the language. And there has historically been more allegiance to Russia in the eastern part of the country.\n\nBut Putin’s indiscriminate brutality against civilians is uniting Ukrainians in a way they’ve never been brought together before. One commentator called hate a “hidden treasure” in war because it can sustain resistance for generations.\n\nHitler’s indiscriminate brutality against Soviet civilians also played a crucial factor in his defeat.\n\nHitler had many potential allies in the Soviet Union. Many Soviets despised and feared Stalin, who routinely murdered political opponents, executed military leaders and persecuted Soviet citizens. He murdered about four million Ukrainians by starving them during one infamous period known as the Holodomor.\n\nThat’s why some Soviets initially welcomed Hitler as a liberator, and gave some German troops Christmas presents.\n\nOnlookers survey the damage at a residential building that was hit in an alleged Russian airstrike in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on February 25. Timothy Fadek/Redux for CNN\n\nBut Hitler’s brutal treatment of civilians quickly stiffened Soviet resistance. German troops looted and starved Russian cities into submission. They rounded up Soviet Jews and other minorities, shooting them or poisoning them in mobile gassing vans. Nazi propaganda taught Germans that Soviets were generically inferior “Mongolized” Slavs who deserved death or enslavement.\n\n“The Nazis were not an occupying force; they were an extermination force from the start,” says DeSimone, the historian from Utica University.\n\nStalin was so hated that roughly a million Soviets served in the German army, says Johnson, the Notre Dame historian. Hitler’s brutality destroyed any chance he had of picking off Soviet sympathizers and weakening Soviet resistance, Johnson says.\n\n“Instead of taking advantage of large numbers of people who might been sympathetic or at least think the Germans were better than the Soviets,” he says, “Hitler rapidly alienated all those groups.”\n\nHe’s using Hitler-like language to justify war\n\nLast summer, Putin published a lengthy essay entitled “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians” that sought to explain that there was an artificial division between the two countries and that “true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a celebration marking the eighth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on March 18, 2022. Mikhail Klimentyev/SPUTNIK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe language Putin used caused some historians to shudder. They said he echoed some of the same rhetoric Hitler used in “Mein Kampf,” the dictator’s autobiography and political manifesto. Hitler’s book brimmed with distorted history about Germany’s lost greatness, global conspiracies that undercut Germany’s power, and justifications for conquest of another group of people.\n\n“Like the Führer, the president of Russia bemoans the tragedy that has befallen his homeland, an erstwhile empire, and he too wants to turn back the clock,” wrote Avi Garfinkel, a reporter for Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, in an article entitled, “How Putin’s Ukraine Agenda Evokes Hitler’s Mein Kampf.”\n\nThis may be one of the most disturbing links between Putin and Hitler. Some Putin critics say he is using Nazi language and propaganda techniques to justify the invasion of Ukraine. They compared the “Z” inscribed on Russian tanks to a symbol used by Nazis in concentration camps. Others compared a recent massive war rally Putin led in a Moscow stadium to scenes of a Hitler speech in an infamous Nazi propaganda film called “Triumph of the Will.”\n\nGerman leader Adolf Hitler addresses soldiers at a Nazi rally in Dortmund, Germany. Hulton Archive/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nSome of the strongest reaction to Putin’s rhetoric stems from his claim that the Russian army is striving for the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine and seeks to protect people who have been “abused by the genocide of the Kyiv regime.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Jewish community in Ukraine reacts to Putin's Nazi rhetoric 05:14 - Source: CNN Jewish community in Ukraine reacts to Putin's Nazi rhetoric 05:14\n\nTimothy Snyder, a leading authority on Central European history and the Holocaust, says Putin’s claim about “de-Nazification” is “grotesque” because he’s trying to justify invading a democratic country – led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust – by claiming he’s there to fight Nazis.\n\nSnyder calls Putin’s justification a variation of Hitler’s Big Lie – a Nazi propaganda technique that insists that if a political leader repeats a colossal untruth enough, people will eventually believe it.\n\n“Adolf Hitler had some public relations advice: Tell a lie so big that people will not believe that you would ever try to deceive them on such a grand scale,” Snyder wrote in an essay titled, “Putin’s Hitler-like tricks and tactics in Ukraine.”\n\nBy telling lies that Ukraine is run by Nazis bent on genocide, Putin is making a mockery of people who survived the Holocaust, says Snyder, author of “On Tyranny.”\n\nA Nazi propaganda image showing German troops being hailed as liberators in Riga, Latvia, during World War II. Universal History Archive/UIG/Shutterstock\n\nYet Putin’s embrace of the Big Lie could also backfire. In a country where many citizens’ ancestors perished in the Holocaust, invoking such a historical tragedy to justify war may only make some Ukrainians more determined to defend their homeland.\n\nPerhaps that is why some Ukrainians no longer call Putin the Russian president.\n\nThey call him “The New Hitler.”\n\nWhat could be the biggest irony of all\n\nWe know the result of Hitler’s invasion. The Soviet Union eventually destroyed the Nazi war machine. The Soviets, more than any country, were responsible for the defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler committed suicide as Russian troops closed in on his Berlin bunker in 1945.\n\nAn estimated 26 million Soviets died during World War II. One was Putin’s two-year-old brother, Viktor, who died after the German army lay siege to a Russian city, blocking the delivery of food and water.\n\nWe don’t know how the war in Ukraine will end. Putin could still prevail. He could split the nation and seize the energy-rich resources of Eastern Ukraine and consolidate his hold on the country’s coastline, some say.\n\nGerman artillery in the streets of Stalingrad in 1942, shelling a factory that was reportedly used by Soviets as a base for counter-attacks. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAnd we know that in war no one side has a monopoly on brutality. A far-right group with a history of neo-Nazi leanings has played a crucial role in Ukrainian resistance. Ukrainian soldiers have been accused of shooting Russian prisoners.\n\nBut if Ukraine somehow preserves its independence and its territory, something may happen that could lead to one of the biggest ironies of all.\n\nA Ukrainian victory will be depicted as another Great Patriotic War. Ukrainians will commemorate their country’s victory with parades and monuments. And Putin will no longer be hailed as a shrewd and bold leader who restored Russia’s greatness by manipulating chess pieces on a global stage.\n\nHe will be seen as a fool whose hubris and brutality drove him into making the same mistakes as the dictator he professed to despise.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/politics/donald-trump-jr-meadows-text/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: 'We control them all': Donald Trump Jr. texted ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nTwo days after the 2020 presidential election, as votes were still being tallied, Donald Trump’s eldest son texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that “we have operational control” to ensure his father would get a second term, with Republican majorities in the US Senate and swing state legislatures, CNN has learned.\n\nIn the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/18/national-parks-diversity-culture/75189914007/", "title": "Once segregated Texas school highlights little known Latino history", "text": "That fall morning in 1954 is a memory Jessi Silva cannot let go.\n\nAt 6, she had just started first grade. The Mexican American students of Blackwell School were marched to the flagpole, kicking up clouds of dirt along the school's barren grounds in Marfa, Texas.\n\nMoments earlier, teachers had handed out slips of paper and told them to copy the letters on the blackboard: S-P-A-N-I-S-H. Now all those slips were stuffed into a cigar box, then placed in a miniature grave in a make-believe burial. “Mr. Spanish,” they were told, was being laid to rest.\n\n“They didn’t explain why,” said Silva, now 76. “The only thing I remember is they said, ‘From now on you will not be allowed to speak Spanish in school.’”\n\nUntil mandatory integration measures forced its closure in 1965, Blackwell was one of numerous schools throughout the American Southwest and beyond that students of Mexican descent were compelled to attend, separate from their white peers, in an era of de facto segregation. About 4,000 students attended Blackwell over its 56-year run.\n\nNow the still-standing structure in far west Texas’ Presidio County is officially celebrated as the country’s newest national park site and just the second honoring modern Latino history. Though national parks might conjure visions of sprawling wildlands and majestic vistas, the National Park Service has put growing emphasis on historic sites highlighting untold stories of American diversity – and some hope Blackwell’s designation will open the door to greater recognition of the nation’s Latinos.\n\n“A complete history of America must include everyone’s story,” park service director Chuck Sams said in a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior. “The designation of Blackwell School National Historic Site is an important step in telling a more diverse and inclusive history of the Mexican American experience in our country.”\n\nThe history of Blackwell – “written by prejudice rather than law,” as the statement put it – is a reminder of how racism and cultural disparity informed education and social systems in the U.S. for decades. For those of Mexican descent, it persisted despite their classification as legally white in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War in 1848.\n\n“There was no law that said they had to be segregated, but you started seeing these so-called Mexican schools to segregate them from their Anglo counterparts,” said historian Cristobal Lopez, Texas field representative for the National Parks Conservation Association, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy agency that aided the site’s bid for national park status.\n\nThough Silva’s feelings about her experience are complicated, she’s among a number of alumni whose alliance and foresight laid the groundwork for Blackwell’s preservation. Built in 1909, the three-room adobe schoolhouse is one of few such “Mexican schools” preserved in original form.\n\n“It’s very rare to find a structure from that era that has not been converted to modern use or demolished,” said Kyle Groetzinger, associate communications director for the conservation association.\n\nThe effort to save Blackwell became a rallying point for a community that has gone from dusty desert outpost to trendy arts community, population 1,725.\n\n'National parks should tell all Americans' stories'\n\nThe nation's national parks, visited by more than 325 million people in 2023, have a unique mission in America: Along with mountains and rivers and canyons, they draw attention to revealing chapters in U.S. history − places where misdeeds were done, movements launched, heroes made and lessons left to be learned for future generations. In some cases, they offer validation of one's place in the American mosaic.\n\nThe past decade has seen the creation of multiple national park sites recognizing America's diverse history. Among them are the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York, and Stonewall National Monument in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, site of the 1969 riots that sparked the LGBTQ+ movement. There's also the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in Alabama, honoring the civil rights campaign of 1963, including the 16th Street Baptist Church where four Black girls were killed by a bomb planted by white supremacists.\n\nCamp Nelson National Monument in Jessamine County, Kentucky, highlights the Union Army camp that became a Civil War recruiting station for formerly enslaved Black soldiers who could earn their freedom by enlisting. Amache National Historic Site in Prowers County, Colorado, preserves an internment camp site to which Japanese Americans were forcefully relocated during World War II.\n\nLast year, the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, encompassing several locations in Chicago and Mississippi, was designated by President Joe Biden to memorialize the 14-year-old Black teen whose abduction and lynching in 1955 would spark the modern Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe sites achieved national park prominence because of their unique place in American history − not so much because of their location but because of what happened at them.\n\n\"National parks should tell all American stories, and maybe especially stories we're not always proud of,\" Groetzinger said. The National Park Service, he said, is starting \"starting to make great strides in expanding the range of stories they tell at these parks.\"\n\nThe divisions in today's social climate make such gestures more important, he said.\n\n“We’re at an inflection point in our country, and this is a chance to start genuine dialogue about discrimination,” Groetzinger said. “Establishing sites like Till and Blackwell do not address systemic discrimination, but they’re a starting point in getting to know our neighbors better and creating a better world together.”\n\nA 1950s view of Marfa, Texas\n\nIn Texas, the nation's newest national park offers a glimpse into a period both shameful and yet illuminating of America's past.\n\nA description of mid-1950s Marfa appears in “George Stevens, A Life on Film,” Marilyn Ann Moss’ biography of the man who directed the 1956 epic “Giant.” The film, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean, was partly shot there.\n\nAccording to Moss, the film crew arrived in June 1955 and soon began griping about the heat and lack of amenities. Moss quotes the autobiography of actress Mercedes McCambridge, who reviled the setting as “the ugliest landscape on the face of the earth. Sheer nothing! No hills, no water, no trees, no grass, just vast acres of creepy-crawlies and dive-bombing bugs.”\n\nMarfa was born in 1881 as a freight stop on the Southern Pacific railroad, and the tracks cutting through town would largely divide its white and Mexican populations. Though some children found ways to forge bonds with their across-the-tracks counterparts, Blackwell alumni recall feeling unwelcome on the north side, home to Marfa’s nicer stores, amenities and the all-white elementary school whose used books and equipment were passed on to Blackwell kids.\n\nSilva remembers segregated theaters, separate Catholic churches and stores with signs prohibiting Mexicans. The funeral for “Mr. Spanish” had left her sad and hurt and would eat at her for years, along with memories of students facing the paddle for language or other violations.\n\n“We could hear kids getting paddled in the principal’s office down into the classrooms,” she said. “There were times when they would paddle a boy in the classroom and make him turn around and face the class. We were all crying. We felt for him. They would paddle us for any little thing – for speaking out of turn or dropping your pencil on the floor. We were like zombies.”\n\nSilva knows not all her classmates harbor the same resentment, and others remain so pained that they won’t speak of it. But for her and other alumni who worked to save the school, national recognition of the site and its place in history signifies a validation of their experience.\n\n“They’re thankful their story is now going to be told on the national stage,” Lopez said. “They can’t shy away from the fact that they were part of a segregated system, but they want people to know they persevered.”\n\nAlumni join forces to preserve aging structure\n\nThe effort to save Blackwell launched in 2006 with a group of alumni who had been planning a school reunion. By then, all that remained of Blackwell’s 5-acre, six-building complex was the original three-room adobe schoolhouse and a band hall behind it.\n\nAfter being tipped off about district plans to dispose of the buildings, they negotiated with district leaders to assume control of the site on a 99-year lease for $1 a year so the structures could be preserved.\n\nTheir newly created Blackwell School Alliance revived the site as a community center and museum, collecting oral histories and hundreds of artifacts donated by Marfa residents and alumni. More recently, the alliance worked to get Blackwell recognized by the Texas Historical Commission and then added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe accomplishments were “major steppingstones” toward national park status, said Daniel Hernandez, a communications executive in Dallas and Marfa native who now heads the alliance. “Our alumni have been our biggest champions in this process. It really is a testament to that grassroots effort.”\n\nAmong the alliance’s members were longtime residents like Mario Rivera, who attended the school from 1950 to 1957 and remembers playing in the school playground, a skimpy patch of mostly dirt sporting a slide, swings and merry-go-round along with basketball and volleyball courts.\n\n“Then I’d come home, and Mama’s got dinner,” recalled Rivera, who spent 32 years as Presidio County treasurer. “Those were the golden years.”\n\nThe bubble of his Marfa barrio was all Rivera knew, the kind of small-town community where bike-riding kids knew it was time to go home when the streetlamps came on. His family couldn’t afford the nicer shops north of the tracks, and no one pushed the segregation issue. It was just the way life was.\n\nHe never felt his teachers at Blackwell were condescending and said he understands why they wouldn’t let pupils speak Spanish.\n\n“I guess they wanted us to become more fluent in English,” he said. “But the minute we left the school grounds, it was puro Spanish.”\n\nRivera eventually earned a business degree at Sul Ross State University in nearby Alpine. At the time, Marfa’s limited employment opportunities prompted most graduates to move elsewhere, and the city’s economy suffered as a result.\n\nThat started to change once the city began to be reborn as an artists’ colony. Now, the cost of living has skyrocketed and Marfa is a trendy celebrity hangout.\n\nBut one thing hasn’t changed, Rivera said:\n\n“The majority of Mexicanos are still south of the tracks.”\n\n'This was an untold story in American history'\n\nGretel Enck is among the city's newcomers, a novelist who visited nearby Big Bend National Park and swooned over the desert landscape and Marfa's growing arts community.\n\n“The thing about Marfa is that it’s this authentic borderland community,” Enck said. “We pack the stands for Friday night football with our six-man football team. All the things you imagine about small-town Texas are very real here.”\n\nEnck moved to 2015, the same year PBS released the documentary “Children of Giant,” about Marfa’s role in the making of “Giant.” Marfa’s standing-room-only screening inspired Enck to become more involved with Blackwell, and she took over the museum’s Saturday visitor hours.\n\nWithin a year Enck had been asked by the alliance’s outgoing president to take over the group, which had funded crucial infrastructure work on the building but wasn’t sure what to do next. She started looking into whether Blackwell might qualify as a national park site.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about windows or adobe bricks, but I had this idea that this place had national significance,” Enck said. “We think of school segregation as something that happened to African American kids, and it became obvious that this was an untold story in American history. ... We had an opportunity and an obligation to make sure it was preserved.”\n\nAround 2018, Enck ran into then-U.S. Rep. Will Hurd at a local coffee shop and took the opportunity to explain the group’s aspirations. Hurd connected her with the conservation association, which partnered with the alliance to promote bipartisan bills designating Blackwell as a national park.\n\nBiden signed The Blackwell School National Historic Act into law in October 2022.\n\n“I’m somebody who has big visions and dreams, and those often don’t work,” said Enck, who stepped down as alliance president last year. “But when you’re on the right path, all the doors open, and I felt like that was the case with Blackwell School.”\n\nFor one student, realization of injustice sets in\n\nSilva was the youngest of four siblings who all attended Blackwell. So, too, did their parents, though both dropped out of school before seventh grade to work or help their impoverished families at home.\n\nAs Silva began third grade, her father moved the family to Northern California, where he had gotten full-time work. Suddenly, she was sitting in classrooms alongside white, Black and Asian kids. She began questioning why things weren’t the same back in Texas.\n\nA few years later, Silva’s family moved back to Marfa. In eighth grade, she recalls being among several students who quizzed their white teacher just before lunch about why her own children wouldn’t attend Blackwell.\n\n“She said ‘Because they live closer to the other school,’” Silva remembered. “We said, ‘They could come with you.’ And when we came back from lunch the principal was waiting for us with the paddle and said he didn’t want to hear that kind of talk anymore.”\n\nSilva said her lingering bitterness motivated her in positive ways – to become more outspoken, to fight for her workplace union, and finally to help preserve Blackwell as a symbol of a larger phenomenon she now understands.\n\nEnck, the former alliance president, said that while some might say Blackwell was justified in ensuring that students learned English, children would have learned enough to get by after a couple of years there given that they couldn’t speak their native language. Why, then, could they not attend the school north of the tracks?\n\nShe hears from alumni an appreciation for the schooling they received, and in their collective voices and memories she understands that many found in their geographic, economic and cultural isolation a sense of refuge from the prejudice they and their families faced in the greater community. Their Marfa, she said, was a place where “they didn’t have to feel the sting of differentiation in their face every day.”\n\n“So much about Blackwell School was wrong, and yet there’s this resiliency,” Enck said. “Many got a good education and had good memories of being there, even though they were bristling against the system.”\n\n'It's part of history, whether anybody likes it or not'\n\nBlackwell joins California’s Cesar E. Chavez National Monument as the second national park site to mark modern Latino American history, in that people who experienced that history firsthand are still alive.\n\nThe designation could also be a financial boon for the community; 20 miles north, the Fort Davis National Historic Site welcomes nearly 40,000 visitors a year. Lopez, the conservation association’s Texas representative, hopes the city will work to create better access to the Blackwell site, with more sidewalks and bike lanes in the area.\n\nRivera, the alum and former county treasurer, said the designation matters “because it’s part of history, whether anybody likes it or not. It’s part of the history of the state of Texas and of the United States. There’s some glorious history and there’s some that are more, um, ‘Oops, sorry about that.’ Marfa falls among those. Maybe Blackwell will be a reminder of an idea that was a bad idea.”\n\nFor Silva, it wasn’t until the act became law that could she finally let go of her anger.\n\n“Enough is enough,” she said. “It’s a big step for Marfa. And it’s a huge step for the Hispanic community. We are someone.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/18"}]}

All your questions, answered", "text": "HBO Max is the latest (and potentially last) major streaming service to launch, and it's entering a crowded field in uncharted territory: The coronavirus pandemic has trapped many folks at home, so TV viewing is up. But it arrives with the steepest price tag ($14.99 a month), just as the economy is cratering.\n\nIt has a big leg up on the competition: An existing base of 43 million subscribers to HBO or Cinemax and its existing streaming service. The good news is, many of those users will get the Max upgrade for free, including current subscribers to HBO Now, AT&T and Spectrum Cable. Customers of other systems, including Comcast, would need to drop their HBO subscriptions and sign up at hbomax.com, which is offering a discounted first-year rate of $11.99 a month until May 27. A cheaper version of HBO Max, with commercials, is due in mid-2021.\n\nBut what are you getting for your money? And how is it different?\n\nUnlike Apple TV Plus, it has a library of content, led by TV hits \"Friends\" and \"The Big Bang Theory,\" all of HBO's series, Warner Bros. films, \"Sesame Street\" and several kids shows. Unlike Disney Plus and Hulu, which target young families and adults, respectively, it's designed as a one-stop shop for all ages. And unlike Netflix, it aims to provide what backers call a more \"curated\" collection of content, rather than overwhelming subscribers with endless choices – although fewer options mean less chance of finding something you fall in love with. (Quibi, full of short-form shows with big stars designed for mobile phones, has been a non-starter.)\n\nWarnerMedia Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt, whose main focus has been launching HBO Max, says the new service is designed to broaden HBO's existing base by adding programs with broader appeal to younger viewers and women. \"We want to present a curated, focused platform that has high-quality choices for everyone in the family,\" he says. \"We're trying to draft off the philosophy of what HBO has done for all these decades: Less is more and better.\"\n\nNeed a break?

Older series, classic movies\n\nHBO Max has three tentpole TV series: \"Friends,\" which left Netflix in December and has not been available to stream since then; \"The Big Bang Theory,\" which has had no streaming home and ended its run on CBS last May; and more than 300 episodes of \"South Park,\" which has aired on Comedy Central since 1997.\n\nThe service also offers a library of other shows, mostly from the Warner Bros. library, from \"The Bachelor\" to \"Adventure Time\" and from \"The Flintstones\" to \"Doctor Who.\" The movie selection ranges from classics – \"Casablanca,\" \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" – to the \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Austin Powers\" franchises and DC Comics movies.

Among others: the first HBO Max movie, \"An American Pickle,\" starring Seth Rogen, is due Aug. 6, after its planned theatrical release was shelved. Also in the works: Movies from super-producers J.J. Abrams and Greg Berlanti, reality-competition series and remakes of Warner Bros. TV series like \"Gossip Girl\" and \"Head of the Class.\"\n\nPandemic delays\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic shuttered most movie and TV production, however, several other projects have been delayed. Among them: \"The Flight Attendant,\" a thriller starring Kaley Cuoco (\"The Big Bang Theory\") that had begun shooting in New York and was due to premiere this month; and the \"Friends\" cast reunion special, meant to usher in the 236-episode series. Greenblatt says the reunion, which had been scheduled to tape in late March, will happen eventually, but only when it's safe for them to be together.\n\nKids stuff\n\n\"Sesame Street\" is the core property here: New episodes will stream on HBO Max (instead of airing on HBO) starting this fall, and the entire library is available. Also new: \"The Not Too Late Show,\" an Elmo-hosted chat with guests from Jimmy Fallon to the Jonas brothers, and \"Craftopia,\" a kids-crafting competition series. And in its most ambitious attempt to revive classic Warner Bros. cartoons to date, the service will feature 80 new 11-minute Looney Tunes shorts, featuring classic characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. All of these series will be available when the service launches May 27.\n\nThe outlook for success\n\nIn a recent report, Michael Nathanson, a financial analyst at MoffettNathanson, says he's \"impressed by the product, and persuaded by its potential to meet\" the goal of 50 million subscribers by 2024, by attracting \"a broader set of customers\" than HBO Now has. But because the vast majority of initial subscribers already pay for HBO, \"we are more cautious about its financial prospects,\" he says, as the company is investing $2 billion in the service and will lose more revenue it would have generated by selling shows to competing streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nFor newcomers, the price tag may be too steep, especially for those who are feeling a financial crunch or already sign up for some combination of Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, or Apple TV Plus, all cheaper options.\n\n\"It's the oddest of times, and certainly people have a variety of pressures,\" Reilly says. But the competition has lessened for other stuff to watch: \"We're not competing against live events, we're not competing against sports, and we're not competing against a variety of other entertainment driving people's attention away.\"\n\nGreenblatt says \"we're feeling really good about the prospects, given the depth and quality of what we're offering.\" Although it remains unclear how deep and how long the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic will last, is \"we feel really confident that this will land in a good place for people who are looking for great content, more than we could ever imagine when this whole thing started two months ago.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/07/16/lebron-james-space-jam-2-fear-street-what-watch-weekend/7946682002/", "title": "LeBron James' 'Space Jam 2,' 'Fear Street': What to watch this ...", "text": "Need to beat the heat and watch a new movie this weekend?

The leads are watchable and the movie's plenty stylish, yet it's essentially a middling retread of a tale we know all too well.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Vudu, Fandango Now\n\nIf you're really into Shark Week: 'Great White'\n\nThe seafaring thriller tries its best to be a new twist on the shark picture like \"The Shallows,\" but can't even reach the level of \"Jaws 3-D.\" Katrina Bowden and Aaron Jakubenko play the owners of a tourist-friendly charter plane on the Australian coast who are hired by a wealthy couple (Kimie Tsukakoshi and Tim Kano) for a quick trip. Unfortunately, the plane is attacked and sunk by a hungry great white, leaving the survivors bickering on a raft as a toothy predator lurks around them.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters and on Apple TV, Amazon, Fandango Now", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/16"}]}

She doesn’t recall what they were arguing about — probably video games or basement basketball — but she’ll never forget the doled-out consequence when her parents got home from work.\n\nGo to your room? No TV for a week?\n\nNah, the punishment was much harsher: None of the kids would be allowed to go to that night’s Dowling Catholic girls basketball game … at rival Valley, no less.\n\nCaitlin took it the hardest.\n\n“Oh, I remember that so vividly,” she said. “I was so mad.”\n\nQuite the visual followed that evening: 12-year-old Caitlin feverishly trying to capture a radio signal for updates on the family’s living room stereo.\n\nThat little story, in a nutshell, offers a window into what makes Caitlin Clark tick and why she has become one of the most dynamic basketball players today … at any level.\n\nShe possesses a deep love for basketball. She has an intense desire to be constantly surrounded by the game. From a young age, she always brought the fire. And good luck telling her no.\n\n“People know not to make me mad. A lot of people have learned that the hard way,” the University of Iowa sophomore said with a blend of humor and bravado. “I think my teammates know. ‘Don’t mess with her. Because it’s not going to end well.’\n\n“I’m definitely someone who wears my emotions on my sleeve. Some people frown upon that. But I think that’s what makes me so good.”\n\nSo good … seemingly so fast.\n\nEvery few days, it seems, Clark is making a new national headline even more impressive than the last.\n\nAfter scoring 43 points Monday against Ohio State, she completed the month of January having averaged 30.4 points, 7.7 rebounds and 9.1 assists per game — a feat last accomplished in the NBA (which plays 48-minute games instead of college's 40) in 1989, by none other than Michael Jordan.\n\nShe recently became the first player in Division I history — man or woman — to record back-to-back stat lines of 30-plus points, 10-plus rebounds and 10-plus assists. In a subsequent trip to Penn State, Clark set the Big Ten Conference regular-season record for assists in a game (18).\n\nEarlier this season, she became the fastest player in Big Ten history to reach the 1,000-point milestone. It took her just 40 college games.\n\nHow has this lifelong Iowan, who just two weeks ago turned 20 years old, arrived at this point? And where do things go from here?\n\nThere’s a lot behind the story of Caitlin Clark.\n\nAnd it’s easy to sense that her story is just beginning.\n\n'Annoying little sister' proved she belonged\n\nWhen their only daughter was just 2 or 3 years old, Anne and Brent Clark had a sense that Caitlin had unique gifts. Daycare feedback reported exceptional motor skills and coordination. She also showed feistiness and competitiveness at a very young age.\n\nIn first grade, that side emerged upon being given a classroom quiz called “rocket math.” Caitlin raced to complete all the problems as fast as she could. Never mind if she got them correct.\n\n“She’s looking around to see who she beat, rather than whether she was getting the material,” Anne said. “We’ve been having these conversations about Caitlin and her competitiveness her whole life.”\n\nSports became a natural outlet for Caitlin’s competitive side. Even though it was on a 6-foot-high basketball hoop, her father was amazed how effortlessly she could make shots from 15 feet out. She was soon playing for boys teams at a recreational level.\n\nBrent, a four-sport athlete at Indianola High School and a Simpson College standout in basketball and baseball, chuckled as he shared a story from a second-grade team he coached at the AAU state tournament. Caitlin was such a game-changer that a losing opponent’s parent complained that girls shouldn’t be allowed to play on the boys teams.\n\nCaitlin Clark has seemingly always been surrounded by the boys. She's the middle child of three, between older brother Blake and younger brother Colin. One of 20 grandchildren on her mom’s side, almost every cousin in her age range is a boy. The neighborhood of her family’s West Des Moines home, where they have lived since her 2002 birth, was filled with boys her older brother’s age. She wanted to be just like Blake. So, of course, she tried to tag along wherever he went.\n\n“I was always that annoying little sister,” Clark said. “They didn’t really want me around much, so I had to kind of hold my own if I wanted to be with them.”\n\nSeeing their daughter's insatiable energy, Clark’s parents enlisted her in endless activities — volleyball, basketball, soccer, softball, tennis lessons, piano lessons. A diehard Kansas City Chiefs fan, she would often ask her dad to throw the football in their backyard.\n\nSome frustrating experiences in softball, though, would begin to pave the way for basketball to become her premier sport. Already playing up two age levels, Clark would get upset that her throws from shortstop had to be perfect or they would go whizzing past the first baseman.\n\n“She was just so much further advanced in that sport that it just became frustrating for her,” Brent said. “It’s slow. You have to wait your turn to hit.”\n\nSo, she left softball behind with an eye on playing basketball in the summers instead. In sixth grade, she joined the powerhouse All-Iowa Attack program in central Iowa. The program director, Dickson Jensen, saw immediately that Clark’s talent was off the charts and that she had a work ethic to match. She rose the club ranks quickly. Her competitive thirst was finally getting quenched on the basketball court. There were always older, talented girls to compete with — and, more importantly, against.\n\n\"She always initiated it all,” Jensen said. “Then when she was (at the gym), she always wanted to play against somebody better than her.\"\n\nBy eighth grade, she was playing with and against high school seniors. Division I coaches took notice. By her sophomore year at Dowling, she was ranked the No. 1 high school girls' basketball prospect in America.\n\nBuilt and surrounded by family\n\nMajor college programs from coast to coast pursued Clark. Her dad wanted to shield her from too much pressure and handled a lot of the recruiting inquiries. Caitlin ultimately winnowed her final three college choices to Iowa, Iowa State and Notre Dame — all quality programs with longstanding coaches (at the time) within driving distance of her loved ones.\n\nFamily is extremely important to Clark. Ignoring the family piece of Clark’s story would be to ignore her story. Family built her. Family toughened her. Family is what she’s about.\n\nCollege teammate Monika Czinano jokes that Clark “loves to flex her Italian-ness” — a nod to her mom’s Italian heritage. Anne Clark, whose father is former Dowling football coach Bob Nizzi, is the fifth of seven children. Caitlin and her mom love to spend time in the kitchen, often baking up sweets. Mom is known to whip up a batch of cannoli for the whole team. Back at home, Caitlin is known for her Saturday-morning chocolate-chip pancakes. (Or anything with chocolate, really.)\n\nThe more family in the stands, the better Caitlin plays. At least that's her mom's theory, which has been proven true at times.\n\nOne night, Dowling was playing at Ames High School and Caitlin was having a rough outing. Her older brother — now a walk-on football player at Iowa State — was late arriving to the game after finishing up his athletic commitments. Blake has a distinct voice and will often remind his only sister succinctly, “They can’t guard you!”\n\nAfter Blake arrived that night, Caitlin’s demeanor and performance changed.\n\n“He shows up and goes right at her: ‘Right now! Let’s go!’” Anne recalled with a laugh.\n\nAdded Brent: “She had 30-plus points in the second half.” Dowling won the game.\n\nClark has two other go-to girl cousins on her mom’s side, too. Haley and Audrey Faber are the daughters of Anne’s oldest sister, Kathy. The Faber girls starred for Dowling and served as an inspiration for their young cousin. Caitlin idolized them. On Tuesdays and Fridays in the winter, she would go to school giddy because she knew she'd be watching her cousins play later that night. She would often tag along for Dowling team dinners; anything to be close to her cousins and basketball.\n\n(Now you have further context to that Dowling-Valley punishment as a 12-year-old.)\n\nHaley now is part of Bill Fennelly's basketball staff at Iowa State. Audrey, who played at Creighton, is an assistant coach at Dowling. Caitlin fondly recalls 2½-hour car trips with her dad to watch Audrey’s college games in Omaha.\n\nAs Clark’s national prominence has grown, so have the outside pressures. Haley and Audrey remain an important guiding light for their cousin. They know that often means steering the conversation away from basketball.\n\n“Sometimes it’s just letting her vent,” Audrey Faber said. “Sometimes it’s giving her your opinion. Sometimes it’s just trying to be a positive reinforcement.\n\n“Being in athletics, sometimes other people that haven’t been a part of it don’t understand what you’re going through in the thick of it in January — how hard it can be to have a bad loss or how good it is when you beat a top team. Just being able to be a level sounding board for her, as much as we can … it’s just cool to be part of the process. That just goes back to how close our family is.”\n\nSo, when on Nov. 12, 2019, Clark made the seismic announcement that she would become a Hawkeye, it all added up. She could not only play her free-wheeling style (Iowa under Lisa Bluder is annually is among the national leaders in scoring), her support system — the people that she loves the most — would be just a few hours away. Places like UConn or Oregon or Texas were helpless to offer something like that.\n\n'Her teammates love her'\n\nClark’s game showcases her on-court personality. She zooms up and down the floor and frequently uncorks deep 3-pointers (\"logo shots,\" her teammates call them) with an element of flair. She loves playing to — or against — big crowds and will voice her displeasure with perceived officiating slights … as she did vehemently on a non-foul call in the closing seconds of Monday’s 92-88 loss to Ohio State.\n\nChanneling her emotions in a positive way was a challenge growing up. Clark's parents genuinely didn't know if she would be able to handle the scrutiny and high stakes they saw coming. When Caitlin was young, it was common for her to plop on the bench after losses and start sobbing.\n\n“I feel bad for my parents looking back now,” she said with a laugh. “They were probably mortified.”\n\nIt was that competitive streak and outward showing of emotions — including trash-talking with opponents, too — that caused others to wonder if she was selfish or a bad teammate. Clark knows that reputation existed in high school.\n\n“Some people would say she’s cocky. Some people would say she’s arrogant,” said Jensen, who directly coached Clark for four seasons with the All-Iowa Attack team that won a national championship and also included Iowa State star Ashley Joens. “But the reality is if you’re going to be in the limelight and you don’t have some of that? You can’t do it.”\n\nCzinano heard murmurs about Clark's acclaim long before she arrived. She didn’t know quite what to expect. But it didn’t take her long to realize that any negative reputation heaped onto Clark was inaccurate.\n\n\"Those people saying it never played with Caitlin,\" Czinano said. \"They’ve never been in the locker room.\"\n\nPut simply, in four words from fifth-year Hawkeye assistant Raina Harmon: “Her teammates love her.”\n\nClark has an off-court personality that Harmon, who coaches Iowa's perimeter players, described as goofy (a word also used to characterize former Hawkeye star and national player of the year Megan Gustafson). A recent video from the Iowa women’s basketball Twitter account showed Clark and Czinano hilariously improvising a karaoke version of “Life is a Highway” in the team locker room.\n\n“She’s always laughing, always looking to have a good time. She’s the first to crack a joke,” Harmon said. “And she can take some ribbings from her teammates, when they joke on her.”\n\nCredit Bluder — one of six active Division I coaches with 800-plus career wins, including 454 at Iowa — and her staff for developing a team camaraderie that results in genuine joy for each other's successes.\n\nTo paint the picture of her message, Bluder relayed a story that renowned ESPN broadcaster Holly Rowe told during a visit to Iowa City. Rowe was walking through an airport with women’s basketball legend Rebecca Lobo, a towering figure easily noticed by fans. They asked Rowe to take their picture with Lobo.\n\nAs Bluder pointed out: That priceless snapshot to those fans doesn’t get recorded in history without Rowe taking the photo.\n\n“When Caitlin’s light shines, it shines on all of us, even if we have a supporting role. Even if we’re holding the camera,” Bluder said. “It’s shining on everybody. That’s good for our program. That’s good for the university. It’s certainly good for all of us involved.”\n\nCoaches applaud Clark's realization that she's still \"just\" a sophomore and is willing to defer to senior teammates like Czinano (a two-time first-team all-Big Ten pick) and Kate Martin, who have both been to an NCAA Tournament Elite Eight.\n\nIf Martin senses Clark getting too upset, she’ll encourage her to take a deep breath.\n\n“Her ability to listen and to be coachable by her teammates can get overlooked,” Harmon said.\n\nClark deserves credit, too, for knowing that the best path to team success is by getting everyone involved and taking personal accountability. She had 11 turnovers in a recent win at Northwestern. She's not perfect.\n\n“That’s something coach Bluder preaches on: ‘If they don’t catch the pass, just take the blame. It’ll make them feel better. They’ll catch the next one and score for you,’” Clark said. “That’s been a big area for growth for me.”\n\nIt’s equally impressive to see how Clark handles life off the court. She is excellent with media. She stays late after games for kids who want to meet her. She states that she wants to help increase excitement for women’s basketball. With those qualities, it’s no wonder that Hy-Vee — which sponsors world-famous superstars like Patrick Mahomes — in October made Clark the first college athlete it partnered with in the new era of name, image and likeness, where college athletes can profit off their fame.\n\n“I do enjoy (the attention), because one of my goals is to inspire the next generation,\" Clark said. \"I’ll always take time to sign kids’ autographs after games. … I feel like I was just in those kids’ shoes.”\n\nAsked what makes them most proud about their daughter, Brent and Anne Clark point to Caitlin’s personal growth, not her personal accomplishments.\n\n“I am just amazed,\" her mom said, \"at how she handles it all. She’s driven. She’s humble. And caring.\"\n\nHigh-stakes moments coming soon\n\nClark’s notoriety is growing by the day. The sleek and slender 6-foot guard leads Division I women in points per game (26.5), assists per game (8.2) and triple-doubles (five). Her 8.5 rebounds per game also lead the team and rank seventh in the Big Ten. Clark's 43-point outburst Monday, in which she canned seven 3-pointers, was the most-watched regular-season women's game in Big Ten Network history, with 164,000 viewers.\n\nJensen, well-versed on the national scene, thinks she’s already among the top five players in the United States — college or pro. What makes her great, he said, is combining elite skill with a high-level understanding of the game.\n\n“Caitlin, if she ever wants to be a coach … I mean, she can sit on the sideline and orchestrate the game,” Jensen said. “She understands it. She knows it. That just puts her at another level.”\n\nBut getting back to what drives Clark: team success. When she committed to Iowa and many times since, she has boldly stated her intent to lead the Hawkeyes to the program’s second Final Four and first since 1993.\n\nThat remains her No. 1 goal. She and her teammates have three more chances to do it. (Yes, she plans on staying through her senior year before pursuing a pro career.) March Madness is just a month away.\n\n“People still probably roll their eyes even if I said that now. I don’t really care,” Clark said. “It takes a lot to go to the Final Four. We’re not oblivious to that, at all. The stars are going to have to align. You’re going to have to have a little luck with it. That’s just how the NCAA Tournament works. You have to get a good draw. But if you’re playing your best basketball in March, anything can happen.”\n\nClark and the Hawkeyes experienced a choppy start to the season, with a long pause due to a team outbreak of COVID-19 and some subsequent losses as they were slow to get their legs back. But now they’re humming at 15-5 overall and 9-2 in Big Ten play. On Sunday, Iowa arguably will play its highest-stakes game of the season: at fifth-ranked Michigan, a 5:30 p.m. CT showdown that’ll air on BTN.\n\nIf you haven’t been tuning in, there’s no better time to start.\n\nYou won’t be disappointed. Win or lose, there’s no more exciting and passionate college basketball player to watch than Iowa’s own, Iowa-grown Caitlin Clark.\n\n“I want to win so bad. I am going to show how I’m feeling,” Clark said. “I think if I tried to play stoic and not show emotion — I know for some people, that works. That’s how (former Hawkeye) Joe Wieskamp was, that’s how (current Hawkeye men’s star) Keegan Murray is, and they’re tremendous players.\n\n“I’m just the complete opposite. If I’m at my best, I’m having fun, showing my emotion, getting into it with the crowd. That’s who I am. That’s who I’ve always been.\"\n\nHawkeyes columnist Chad Leistikow has covered sports for 27 years with The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY and Iowa City Press-Citizen.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/festival-international/2015/04/17/tips-keep-love-festival/25927569/", "title": "5 tips to 'keep the love' at Festival 2015", "text": "Jessica Goff\n\njgoff@theadvertiser.com\n\nIn preparation for Festival International de Louisiane 2015, I was given the task of addressing a few festival \"do's and don'ts\" and how, to put it politely, not to look like a dunderhead.\n\nTo be fair, this is only my fourth Festival. There are many of you out there who have been attending since it began in 1987. You know the ropes, which include etiquette and overall survival skills.\n\nThese pointers are merely from personal experience and observation.\n\nHey, it's OK that you bought a dashiki in 1998 and dust it off once a year for the occasion. It's OK that you've suddenly tapped into your inner spirit child and are now donning toe rings and henna for the first time in your 22 years on this planet, sister Skylar of Alpha Delta Gamma. That's all part of the fun.\n\nDuring the last two Festivals, I was assigned to check in with law enforcement and report any crime or general misbehavior. Each year such issues have been minimal, according to the Lafayette Police Department.\n\n\"It's really just a big love fest,\" department spokesman Cpl. Paul Mouton has casually said before and during each festival.\n\nThat being said, here are a few tips, obvious as they are, to keep the love.\n\nMind the swing space\n\nThere are a lot of great music acts this year. The stage setup is pretty much same. Barricades will keep you from getting a little too close to the music acts, but it doesn't keep you from your neighbor's personal space. Look, we all want to \"feel\" the music. We all want a chance to dance like the girl in that bee costume in Blind Melon's \"No Rain\" video from 1993. But as the day goes on and Festival crowds start to get denser, keep in mind that your neighbor may not want to feel your armpit hair brush gently against their cheek. Then again, they may want to. You could always ask, but I really wouldn't recommend it. Just be conscious of your surroundings. You can rain dance like no one is watching, but it's probably time to take it down a few notches if the scene starts to look like a tie-dye peppered game of red rover.\n\nMind the little ones. Their bones are soft.\n\nWhen we were kids, my Dad taught me and my sisters a tongue-twister that we'd repeat over and over.\n\nSay it fast five times: \"Rubber baby buggy bumpers.\"\n\nDo not play \"Rubber baby buggy bumpers.\" That is the only way to accurately depict the droves of adult pedestrians crowding the closed streets of downtown Lafayette versus strollers wheeling tiny, wobbly red-faced humans within inches of the pavement. These festi-tots will become harder to spot as the evening goes on, especially on Friday and Saturday nights — Festival's busiest hours. Watch out for them and their parents who are likely just trying to get the heck out of there and safely back to their cars after a long day of family revelry. There may be tears mixed with face paint and someone may be wearing the half-digested remains of a crawfish spinach boat.\n\nAttire\n\nA few weeks ago, I ended up in a Target dressing room stuck in a romper. For those of you who don't know what a romper is, it's a one-piece garment that usually comes in the form of shorts or pants. They are trendy and evidently sometimes complicated. Some humans can be that way, too. This particular romper was designed without rhyme or reason, or perhaps it was just not age appropriate for a 30-something-year-old woman who had specifically gone shopping for a \"care-free\" Festival outfit.\n\nI'm not a free spirit.\n\nI'm usually covered from head to toe in fabric during most seasons. But for this occasion, I wanted to look like I had been running carefree across the Horse Farm like Taylor Swift circa 2009. \"Rompergate\" continued when I ordered another one from a retail store popular with young women. \"I think it's too short,\" I told my younger sister. She asked where I had purchased it. I paused. \"Forever 32.\"\n\nThe point is, be yourself and dress comfortably. It's going to be hot. It could rain. It doesn't matter how many flowers you put in your hair or beard or wherever else you want to stick them. Wear comfortable footwear. Broken glass shouldn't, but does, happen. We live in the Deep South, we should all be fairly privy to the elements by now.\n\nKeep it clean\n\nFestival organizers do a great job at making sure there are trash receptacles strategically placed throughout downtown. Now there's recycling, too. So what's your excuse for placing that empty Michelob Ultra can in the windowsill of the Chase Bank building? You don't have one.\n\nYou also don't have any excuse for bringing a dog. Festival rules say no dogs. Dogs are cute, but not when they are brought by owners who can't respect the rules of a free festival. This isn't Black Pot. You aren't camping. You'll be home in a few hours to walk Rex.

Along with 4.7 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game, Henderson possesses all-around tools that, as Staley has put it recently, could immediately help a team on the next level.\n\nSo where does USC’s senior guard stand in the eyes of WNBA executives and scouts? There’s hard to gauge as the college postseason run stands between now and the WNBA draft (April 15). We can, however, get an idea on where Henderson stands with potentially a month-plus left in her college career to position herself as best as possible through dissecting a few mock drafts.\n\nSouth Carolina point guard Destanni Henderson could be a WNBA draft steal\n\nAmong three mocks, Henny is predicted anywhere from a late first-round to early second-round WNBA draft choice. And from the evaluations, that’s not an indication of her skill or her generally as a player.\n\nHow the WNBA draft lottery in December shook out has affected how Bleacher Report, ESPN and Winsider see the draft in April unfolding. Teams with higher picks have other needs that a true point guard.\n\nUSC women clinch SEC title: South Carolina basketball clinches outright SEC regular season championship\n\nIn these mock drafts, Henny is anywhere from the fourth to sixth guard selected. Kentucky’s Rhyne Howard has long been graded as the top guard prospect in the 2022 WNBA draft. But how strong is the argument that Florida Gulf Coast guard Kierstan Bell, Northwestern’s Veronica Burton, UConn tandem Evina Westbrook or Christyn Williams, Tennessee’s Rae Burrell or Michigan State’s Nia Clouden all grade out better than Henderson?\n\nNo one among that group of guards has faced stiffer competition nor has operated an offense that featured more than three primary scorers. Henderson, who has named to a few awards national watch lists, brings all of that to the table.\n\nIf she couples that with a strong performance through the SEC and NCAA tournaments while possibly helping guide USC to a national title and were still to fall outside of the top five, Henderson would likely be the biggest steal of the draft.\n\nDestanni Henderson’s biggest knock?\n\nWhy would South Carolina’s senior point guard have to wait until potentially as late as the second round to be drafted?\n\nGlancing through mock drafts, the one running theme when looking at the other guards next to Henny is size.\n\nProspects like Bell, Burton, Burrell — really all of them — are all listed at minimum 2 inches taller than Henderson, who is 5-foot-7. Burton is 5-9, Clouden from Michigan State is 5-8, while Williams from UConn is 5-11. The rest of the guards are at least 6-0.\n\nThe biggest question surrounding Henny and her draft potential seems to be how much WNBA general managers covet size over performance under the brightest lights and intangibles.\n\nA look at Destani Henderson’s 2022 WNBA draft projections\n\nWinsider has Henderson coming off the board with the ninth pick of the first round — her highest projection — by the Seattle Storm. Legend Sue Bird will play one final season and Henderson “would give the Storm someone who can bridge the team toward the future,” Winsider writes.\n\nESPN has Henny coming off the board in the final pick of the first round (12th overall) to the Connecticut Sun. ESPN writes, “the Sun might see her as a good addition to their guard corps with her speed, playmaking ability and defensive prowess.”\n\nBleacher Report projects Henderson falling to the second round with the Atlanta Dream selecting her 14th overall, the second pick of that round. The Dream currently have guard Chennedy Carter, who shined at Texas A&M years ago. But Bleacher Report noted Henderson’s knack for “leading a team with some of the best players in the country (Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke) and excels at creating plays in transition.”\n\nCory Diaz covers the South Carolina Gamecocks for The Greenville News as part of the USA TODAY Network.

I loved to sit on top of the potting shed among the climbing roses and watch the sun go down behind the neighbors' fences. There were plenty of birds to study … but that was business. The sun going down was pure pleasure. It was orange and pretty and meant the grass would be dry, not all wet with the drizzle that happens when the fog flows in. The sun setting also meant Joe would be coming home from work soon and would be eager to see me and feed me. What joy he seemed to get when I rubbed up against his lower leg. Whether I was hungry or not, I always ate a little of the food he put out just in case he got the wrong message and stopped doing it.\n\nYes, for most of my life, I always thought positively of sunsets. That ended suddenly at my last visit to the vet. It was time for my annual poking with needles, which I don't like, and the warm massaging by the vet's hands which I adore. The lady vet used the word \"sunset\" but she applied it to \"me.\" In her opinion I was close to the end of \"my\" day.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt's a fact we all have to face, I suppose, and certainly a moment that was important for me to think about — and I have with considerable effort. I now feel strongly that I shouldn't leave this earth without more people understanding my accomplishments and the obstacles I had to overcome to create the favorable and mostly comfortable home I've enjoyed. Yes, he could have given me more tuna water and more food with gravy in it and laid off a couple of those baths which I clearly didn't need, but those are small and forgivable points.\n\nSo with that preface, I decided through purrs, blank stares, occasional growls and hisses, some head butting, a few meows and much telepathy, to dictate my story to Joe, who has typed it into the computer. I could have done the typing myself as Joe knows perfectly well. Indeed, I have spent more than a few moments showing him I could get letters to appear on the computer screen usually while he was sitting right in front of it and concentrating on some unrelated topic. He never figured out I was trying to write, \"My food bowl is empty.\" But I must agree with him that although I'm good at typing I'm just not very adept at correcting my typos.\n\nI'll tell you all where I actually came from a little later, but for now let's go to that warm Sunday afternoon in July 2002. Joe had roasted a chicken and was busy enjoying it while sitting on a chair on his patio. I'd done some advance work scoping out his yard and noticed that there were no other cats and, thank god, no little barky dogs — which seemed to be everywhere else in the neighborhood. I was quite athletic at that time and could easily escape up and over a fence given the slightest indication of hostility.\n\nJoe was distracted by the smell and taste of that roasted chicken and I must admit its aroma convinced me I needed to make my move.\n\nWith a sort of distant expression on his face, Joe looked up. A piece of chicken was still in his mouth and he just stared at me. I was maybe 10 feet away. He froze in that position and I figured that a few feet closer would still provide plenty of escape paths. I lifted my head, pointed my nose in his direction and gave my nostrils an exaggerated wiggle — as if sampling the air. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, now that I'm thinking about it, but I hadn't eaten anything substantial in nearly two days and I really wanted some of that warm chicken. I sniffed again.\n\nYep, it worked. Up Joe went, grabbed a little clean sheet of paper, tore some chicken up and put it on the ground between us. I'd backed away a few steps just to make sure there was no funny business attached to his charity. But sure enough, he returned to his chair and it was obvious I was free to go taste le poule en papier. It was good. He's a decent cook. I tried to remember my manners, though, and ate slowly, savoring every morsel.\n\nHe looked down saw the empty paper and then gave me more — thigh meat this time. What heaven!\n\nIt turns out Joe at 52 had never owned a pet. That's why, in large part, I'm writing this commentary. So you might understand how much training I had to do with this fellow.\n\nSo that was the start. After I'd finished a second helping that was much more generous than the first, I walked a little closer to Joe, sat down — still facing him because you never know about humans — and started washing. I always begin with front paws to my face, then my chin, my chest, my sides, my back paws, hips and rump. It's then I noticed that Joe was staring at me with his mouth open again.\n\nHe looked at my backside carefully and came to the conclusion that I must be a Salinas street cat that got its tail whacked off. This caused a rush of sympathy from him to me and I did nothing to stop it. (I actually was born with a bit of a tail that he hadn't yet noticed, but we'll get to that in a little bit.)\n\nJoe put away the chicken and decided to work in his rose garden for the rest of this fateful afternoon. I just hung around and watched him. Then, opportunity struck. I am indeed lucky.\n\nAs he was dead-heading a rose bush near the patio, I noticed a little motion over by the back fence. I suspected something like this when I was surveying the landscape but wasn't sure. With Joe watching I darted as fast as I could across the lawn into the back garden and BANG — got that mouse. I paraded with it just long enough for Joe to see what I'd done, watched him smile and then I jumped back over the fence into a neighbor's yard to enjoy the snack and not to be too much in Joe's face on the first day.\n\nThis little evidence of my usefulness made a profound impression on Joe. How was I supposed to know that he'd had to throw out all of his wooden spoons and bleach all of his utensils because a mouse had gotten into his kitchen drawers through a tiny hole in the back wall and chewed on some and piddled on the others?\n\nAnd here's what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 2\n\nKibbles and bits of info prove invaluable\n\nAfter eating the roast chicken and catching the mouse on the Sunday we met, I returned to Joe's backyard on Monday, waited around under a rose bush and watched the birds flitting around Joe's feeder. Well, I actually caught one spitzy for lunch but had the good sense to eat it over in the neighbor's yard again. Bird feathers go everywhere even when you are careful and cats just aren't very good at hiding their trails.\n\nWhen Joe came home after work, he looked out on the patio. I'd made sure my back was to him (as if I didn't know he was there — I heard the garage door open, for goodness sake). I was looking over at that spot where I caught the mouse.\n\nHe opened the sliding door and I turned around and gave him my friendliest \"meow.\" Sure thing, off he went to the refrigerator and pulled out the leftover chicken. It was awfully nice of this guy to remove the bones and just give me the meat. So clearly he knew a few good things about pets. He wasn't much interested in his garden that evening and went about getting his own supper, watching television and not coming outside. (He likes the nature shows and I have a story to tell you about that but it will have to wait until later.)\n\nOn the following day, Joe left more of that chicken outside before he went to work, I forget where I was in the morning. But the food was there when I showed up around noon. And I decided to sit in the warm sunshine and enjoy his yard again. It was really very beautiful with lots of private places to hide and do those things we all do in private places. That's when I first experienced the potting shed and the mass of climbing pink roses growing up there. It was a near perfect place to look at life in that neighborhood — unseen and unspoiled and unquestionably good camouflage to whack birds. I'm essentially a white cat with very large, irregular black patches. When I hide underneath shrubbery in bright sunshine, I'm pretty much invisible.\n\nWhen Joe came home this next day, he saw me on the patio, put his hand on his chin, shook his head, and disappeared in the kitchen. He returned with some sardines on a paper plate. Apparently, the chicken was gone. Sardines aren't something you usually feed to cats but Joe didn't know that and the gesture was generous and genuine so I accepted the silvery little critters with grace and gratitude. I did like their fishiness but could have done with less salt.\n\nCat food appeared the next evening and a steady stream of culinary delights, some tastier than others, has been present every day ever since.\n\nI heard Joe in the house that week describing his progress to a friend on the phone.\n\n\"I decided to go buy some real cat food,\" he said. \"I went to the grocery store, stood in the pet food aisle and was just overwhelmed. There are so many choices! I wondered whether Princess (that's the word he used when he was referring to me now) would prefer the 'Country Home Platter' or the 'Mariner's Feast?' So I bought four cans of each. I also bought her these cute kibbles. One is shaped like a chicken drumstick, one is a fish, one is like a rib-eye steak, and one is a little white egg.\"\n\nI'm not sure how he decided on the name \"Princess.\" Perhaps it was my manners. I prided myself with control, enjoyed keeping myself well groomed and — this is the one that probably did it — striking graceful poses every time I sat down, especially if he was looking.\n\nJoe was in the garden on the following Sunday. Next to his chair was a stool which he used as a sort of end table. He stopped his work to drink some iced tea and take a break. So he was sitting reading a book and I decided that that stool was the perfect place for my next lesson.\n\nAlthough we had been interacting for the past eight days, we never had any physical contact. Joe had never even scratched my head and likewise I kept my distance. I jumped up onto the stool and quickly laid down. He glanced over at me and kept very still. I looked away, feigning disinterest. Joe went back to his book.\n\nSo, as he was reading \"Out of Africa\" by Karen Blixen, I thought I'd give him a little training on \"Out of Salinas\" by me. Concentrating on the Danish writer's pretty English prose, Joe didn't notice that my paw was slowly approaching the back of his hand. It was the other one that held up the book. This one was just uselessly resting on the chair arm. I gradually placed my paw on the back of his hand. He tensed up. Then I extended my claws only slightly and made contact with his flesh. I gently pulled his free hand closer and closer to me and somehow placed it on the back of my head. He made the connection. One can easily read a book and scratch a cat's neck at the same time — it takes no special talent. I started purring as loudly as I could and he smiled. Apparently, he'd never heard a cat do that or at least never in response to anything he'd initiated. I could tell he liked it.\n\nJoe figured out something else on that second Sunday and I have to give him credit for making another connection. He was proving to be a fast learner. As he was getting ready to go inside for the night, he looked down at my bowl of kibbles on the patio. He liked to look inside it throughout the day and often rushed into the house to fill it up whenever it was slightly empty. So I decided to send him a strong message.\n\nWhen he looked down on this day, he'd noticed I'd eaten all the cute little drumsticks, rib eye steaks and fish but left in the dish all of those lousy tasting eggs. I'm a cat. We're carnivores. We want meat. No exceptions. Feed the eggs to a dog! He seemed to have gotten this message and the next time he filled the dish, it was with plain ole Wiskas — the same thing I grew up on.\n\nAnd then, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 3\n\nHistory and a 'Hello Kitty' blanket\n\nAfter our first week together, I stopped scouring the neighborhood for places to hang out. Joe's yard was Eden. In truth — and somewhat verified by Joe during a summer walk in the neighborhood one year later, I was born a few blocks away in a detached garage toward the back of a yard. We, a group of about eight or ten of us — some related, some not, called that cold garage home. It smelled of ancient motor oil, dirty pesticides, moldy newspapers and well, foul things —dragged in by my housemates and abandoned. A carport on the side of the garage with some broken lawn furniture was also part of this sad domicile.\n\nAt any rate, my old man was a mean cuss and the top cat in the garage. He treated my mother and my aunts like they were disposable. We kittens shut the hell up whenever he came around and lived in fear — usually somewhere in the cobwebbed shadows.\n\nIn retrospect, this former life helped me develop an ability to be almost anywhere I wanted to be and be invisible. This tactic came in handy several times later and I'll tell you about those scary instances soon.\n\nThe gray haired lady who took care of us, visited us every day but rarely did much other than put Wiskas in a dish the size of a bird bath and expect us all to eat from the same plate. I don't think she was allowed to drive a car anymore and that's why the garage was all ours.\n\nOne of the lady's younger friends took me and my sister on a car trip once when we were very young. I don't remember much about it though I do recall some awful smells and a weird sleepiness afterward. I felt sore, too, for a couple weeks like somebody bit me on the bottom.\n\nI suppose in her feeble way the lady kept an eye on us but I think there were just too many of us to garner the special individual attention most cats need. I remember playing with her and my sister a lot when we were kittens but then as we got older she seemed less interested. She coughed a lot, too, which has always made me a bit jumpy — even to this day.\n\nIt was after a morning when she didn't quite put enough food out for all of us to eat that my old man crawled home in a rotten mood. For some reason, he'd decided that I was his target that day. I swear I was just sitting there with my sister watching the others eat when he came over to me, growling at first and then hissing, spitting, and swatting me with his paw.\n\nWho needs that, right?\n\nSo I said good bye to my mother who understood my need to leave and licked my sister's face and took off on my adventure. I never returned.\n\nOf course, I was clever enough to catch birds and mice, and God knows there were enough rats in that Salinas neighborhood to feed a pride of lions.\n\nIt was my luck that I only spent a week or two roving around before I wandered into Joe's rose garden and met perhaps the biggest sap in town. He fussed a lot over inconsequential things in those early days. And, if he wanted to call me 'Princess\" I could live with that.\n\nSo the weeks went by and I took up an increasingly happy residence in Joe's yard, sleeping now on one of the patio chairs or, if it was particularly cold, up on the roof next to the warm chimney. I lived outside and he lived inside. I even let him pick me up now. He seemed to be fascinated by my ever-increasing belly and my stubby tail. I made sure I purred loudly so he'd know it was OK.\n\nWhenever I caught a mouse or a rat, some part of it — usually the crushed bloody head, tail or an occasional paw was there for him to notice. It was my equivalent of a punched time card. I was doing my job and earning my keep. He buried these \"less edibles\" in the garden near a rose bush and seemed pleased with the arrangement. He was startled at first at just how many rodents he was unknowingly sharing his life with.\n\nOne day, Joe showed up with this bright pink \"Hello Kitty\" blanket and put it on one of those patio chairs. He pointed at me and pointed at it, and said something like \"Up. Up. Princess. Up.\"\n\nI mean really! \"Up?\" Poor guy.\n\nHe quickly learned he didn't need to say anything like that. I would go \"Up\" when I felt like going \"Up\" and when there was something special in it for me to go \"Up.\" Pleasing him, reinforcing his congenial behavior still happened to be a priority at the time, so \"Up\" I went and struck an adorable pose.\n\nThen he pulled out of his pocket a black leather collar studded all over with rhinestones and one tiny, tinny bell. He put it around my neck and I didn't struggle too much at first. Then I heard the sound of that darn bell every time I moved or the wind blew. I knew it would spoil my hunting days forever.\n\nThat same morning — thank you Johann Sebastian Bach — Joe happened to be listening to the Cantata BWV No.4 \"Christ lag in todesbanden.\" It was turned up rather loud so he could hear it on the patio. The addition of my little, off-pitch, off-beat noise-maker joining that fine chorus and period ensemble was just as irritating to Joe as it was to me. With one quick motion, Joe yanked the bell off the collar.\n\nThe Bach was indeed fortuitous, \"Christ lay to death in bondage.\" I tolerated the collar for another minute or so and as soon as Joe disappeared I backed out of it easily. It landed under the patio chair. He tried to put it on me again a little later but I wasn't as docile as I was before and squirmed all over the place. He just gave up and stuck it in a drawer somewhere. It reappeared years later, but that's another story.\n\nAnd then, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 4\n\nA calculator moves Joe up a level\n\nEvery month in those days, usually on a Saturday or Sunday morning, Joe spread out all of his bills and letters on the dining room table, plugged in a calculator and proceeded to scribble things onto this and that, tap away on that noisy machine that printed out a long curling tally, and then stuff one piece of paper into another. He'd drag his tongue over the edge, then press it shut with his fingers. I never completely understood why he did these things but they seemed to capture his total attention.\n\nOne weekend, as he was balancing his check book, tapping at that noisy machine, licking his envelopes and putting stamps on them, he heard something unusual. It was a grumbling-like sound that he hadn't ever heard before.\n\n\"Is that the refrigerator?\" he asked himself. It was loud then quiet, loud then quiet. \"Is that the dimmer switch on the light?\" No. He put his ear to the calculator. No. He listened carefully at the window behind him. No, not coming from outside. It was coming from … under the table. He looked on the floor and there was nothing there but the Persian carpet. \"What could it possibly be?\" Then his eyes opened wide. \"You know,\" he thought, \"It sounds like snoring!\"\n\nI mentioned before that Joe has this sliding door that goes out to his patio. He likes to leave that door wide open when he's home. It airs out the house and allows the smell of his many roses to waft into the dining and living room.\n\nJoe was soon to discover what most cat owners know although they may have never heard the word for it. We're crepuscular. That's from the French word for \"twilight.\" But in this sense, it's used to describe our activity level. In normal cats, especially those that live outdoors, we rise before the sun goes up and look for something to eat. We're active until about two hours after sunrise and then we seek out a comfortable place (not too bright, not too warm, not too easily discovered) to sleep through the day. We wake up again in late afternoon, famished, and want to eat something in a hurry. Then we bounce around and play as the sun goes down and stay active to hunt some night creatures. Then about two hours after dark we look for a nice warm spot to rest for the coldest part of the night.\n\nThis said, Joe told all of his visitors — especially those nice ladies that often came to visit, the same ones who brought me toys and treats and who always made a big fuss over me — that \"Princess\" was an outdoor cat. He would feed me, see that I had a good place to sleep but I would not be allowed inside. They shook their heads when they heard this. Remember, Joe had never owned a cat before.\n\nSo there he was working away at the dining room table with its heavy cloth draping over the edge onto the chair seats. There was the sliding door — wide open. There I was absolutely exhausted from the hunt and ready for a warm, dark, safe spot. I'd been up and prowling the neighborhood for nearly four hours. I have told you all that I learned how to be invisible.\n\nAs Joe narrowed down the source of the noise, he lifted the tablecloth and discovered me — all four paws up in the air, mouth a bit opened and sound asleep on the chair next to his. Sorry about the snoring. It stopped when I rolled over. He wasn't sure what to do next. He had visions of me going bonkers, dragging the tablecloth and all that rested on it onto the floor, of me ripping up all the upholstery on his wing-backed chairs, of me knocking over and breaking the Kenyan wood carvings on the mantle that he'd dragged out when he started reading \"Out of Africa.\"\n\nBut here's what actually happened. I felt the tablecloth move. Lifted my head up, looked at Joe through squinting, half-asleep eyes, rolled over, exhaled loudly and was soon snoring again.\n\nIt doesn't sound like much of a turning point in Joe's life, but it was. He'd mostly lived alone and thought he liked it that way. Now, having me in the house, it made him feel entirely different. There was someone else around. Not intrusive, not much bother and yet, someone to talk to and someone who would listen to his mumbling, cussing, singing, noise making and classical music. (When he starts the day with a baroque soprano, I go outside. I've learned to prefer Debussy.)\n\nAgain, it was lucky for him that I was also a talker. And whenever he turned to me and started speaking, I quickly answered him, although I'm not certain he always caught the direction I was trying to turn the conversation.\n\nFrequently, when something was not as I wanted it and Joe was busy, I'd stand in front of him and simply stare at him. My brainwaves said, \"OK, let's review the things I could ever possibly want. Food — have some. Water — bowl is full. Door — wide open. Scratch on head — just had that. Let me see. What might it be?\"\n\nHow about \"Follow me?\" I usually can get him to stop whatever he is doing and look into what I want to show him.\n\nOn one such occasion, I led him outside where he looked around quickly and shouted.\n\n\"It's the hose. I left it on. Oh, what a good kitty.\" Another scratch on the head.\n\nPersonally, I don't care how he wastes water. The yard was flooded. I wanted to walk across it and I do not appreciate getting my feet wet in the process. He needs to know that.\n\nEventually, after hundreds of \"Listen, Repeat; Listen, Repeat\" language exercises, Joe came to understand my most frequent expressions. Indeed, he knows when I say, \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"I want out,\" \"Thank you\" and \"God d****t, cut that s**t out!\"\n\nSince my comfy snooze on Joe's dining room chair ended uneventfully – he started clearing up the papers and putting away things the commotion of which disturbed my sleep, I jumped down on the floor and without looking back went outside for a drink of water. I could feel Joe's eyes on me and knew he must be thinking, \"No harm done.\" And indeed there hadn't been. That was my point.\n\nAs I was drinking from a water dish he placed outside in the garden which the birds loved to sip from – oh, the taste of bird in that water is … heavenly. I heard Joe sigh loudly and slide the door closed.\n\nAnd this is what he did next … to be continued next Saturday.\n\nFollow Joe Truskot on Twitter @truskot_salnews #salinas and like his Facebook.com/joetruskot page.\n\nColumn 5\n\nWhen it rains, it pours\n\nMy comfy snooze on Joe's dining room chair ended uneventfully. He started clearing up his papers and putting away things — the commotion of which woke me. I jumped down and without looking back went outside for a drink of water. I could feel Joe's eyes on me and knew he must be thinking, \"No harm done.\" And indeed there hadn't been.\n\nAs I was lapping up water from a large ceramic bowl he placed in the garden, I heard Joe slide the door closed. I didn't bother to turn around as, truthfully, I was too distracted by the taste of that delicious water with its slight hint of bird.\n\nMy introduction to indoor living at Joe's had to be gradual. \"Let's not rush and spoil a good thing,\" I thought, and the days uneventfully passed.\n\nOne afternoon, Joe was sitting and still making his way through \"Out of Africa\" — he's a slow reader and often mumbles words out loud, especially those that begin with \"Ng\" and \"Mb.\"\n\nAt any rate, he was inside sitting in his big leather chair and the sliding doors were open and I was on the patio and I just walked inside and laid down leaning my head on his foot. I exhaled loudly and stayed there. He did nothing for the longest time and I was all set to shoot right out that door if there was the slightest indication of his panicking.\n\nEventually, I moved my head away and he got up to fill his coffee cup. I watched him for a minute. Then, a spitzy flew right into a picture window and I took off outside to see if I could grab an easy snack. I almost had it but the bird recovered too quickly and flew out of reach. I didn't go back inside but later that day sat beside Joe as he was pulling weeds. Life was good.\n\nIn Salinas, we often get an early rain in October. Although we welcome rain whenever it arrives, no one is ever ready for these sudden showers. That was the case with me and Joe.\n\nWhen the rains started to pelt the grass with blobs of water, I jumped up on the dusty work bench in the potting shed and decided that was a convenient place to watch the wind blow things around.\n\nIt was early evening when the sliding door opened.\n\n\"Princess, Princess,\" Joe called.\n\n\"Meooooooow,\" I answered back and watched him come outside in the downpour and run across the yard to the shed.\n\n\"Meow\" I said when he appeared next to me.\n\n\"Let's go in the house. OK?\" he asked.\n\nI mention this because he started this come-out-of-the-rain thing. Not me.\n\nJoe lifted me up and tucked me under his arm and across the wet grass he ran.\n\nThe patio has an aluminum roof which makes a thunderous racket when rain falls. We sat together on a patio chair, me sitting on his lap now. He soon discovered our body temperature is 104 degrees normally so if we sit long enough on a human being we give off heat. He liked that. We stayed there for awhile watching the roses and trees sway in the wind. Then, he got cold and carried me inside.\n\nWe played together for a while on the living room floor. By now, just about every friend of his brought me a little toy so there was a large collection to choose from. I preferred the furry mice with catnip stomachs. He tossed them and I rushed after them and caught them sometimes in mid air.\n\nWe got tired of doing that rather suddenly. He sat quietly for awhile and just watched me explore the living room.\n\nThe TV was in the big bedroom and that's where Joe went. I followed him. I didn't know how to tell him that I had to go … well, you know … use a litter box. But search as I did, I couldn't find one. So I jumped up on the bed and sat on the corner with him which he seemed OK with as his attention was on the TV.\n\nI turned to him and uttered my \"I've – got – to – go – to – the – bathroom\" meow but for all intents and purposes I might have recited the Preamble of the United States Constitution. His cat lingua was deficient.\n\nFinally, I couldn't hold it any longer. I was busting. I jumped off the bed, went to the bedroom door and asked him once again to let me out. No response. So I went inside the closet and relieved myself.\n\nThere was a terrible commotion. Many harsh words came out of this fellow. He grabbed me and rushed me to the sliding door and meanly put me down on the bricks outside — still shouting at me.\n\nTo tell you that I felt bad about this incident wouldn't express to you how embarrassed and humiliated I was. I had disappointed Joe — that I know. But he put me on the pedestal, told everyone he came in contact with — even those who don't like cats and were being polite — what a godsend his little \"Princess\" was.\n\nThe facts are there for all to see. I'm a mammal. Mammals drink water. Then, mammals have to pee. That's how it works. We can live together comfortably but that has to be understood.\n\nAfter I was tossed outside, Joe got a pail of warm water and some Spic 'n' Span and cleaned up the place where I peed. Awhile later, Joe came outside with a fluffy towel, threw it roughly on one of the chairs and went inside again, closing the sliding door loudly, as if that was supposed to make matters better.\n\nI spent the rest of that rainy night on a chair on the patio. I was left out there to feel terrible about my accident.\n\nYet, all things pass. That's what I've learned over the course of my lifetime. And in just about every circumstance, the enormity of the offense wears away.\n\nThe next morning, Joe put food out, then disappeared in his truck. When he returned, about an hour or so later, he came out onto the patio with a large plastic litter box under his arm and a box of litter with the word \"EXTREME\" written on it in big letters. You can count on him to overdo just about everything.\n\nSo I sat patiently watching him open the box of litter, pour its contents into the plastic tub, smooth it out with his little plastic rake and point to it — indignantly saying \"Do you know what this is? What it's for?\"\n\nI stayed cool. Always be classy when faced with people who want to rub your nose in mistakes you made. I casually stepped inside the box, squatted, peed, stared off into space, turned, smelled and covered it all up — exaggerating my action and making an unnecessarily large mound on top. I stepped outside of the box and walked into the garden with no further comment. If I had a tail, it would have been raised high. I could feel Joe's smile on my back.\n\nThe litter box was placed in a low traffic area inside the house and I rarely used it. Rarely, I say — until the last few months, when I seem to be in and out of it all day and all night long.\n\nThen, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 6\n\nA big belly and 'The Crying Game'\n\nI had just finished a terrific meal — Fancy Feast's Grilled Tuna with Gravy — when I felt Joe staring at me. He'd watched me eat breakfast for at least four months but on this day he seemed particularly focused on my stomach. He was apparently concerned about its increasing size. The gears in Joe's head were spinning fast. I had this horrible feeling that this was not going to end well.\n\nFor the next few days, he kept touching my stomach and groaning. Then one day, out of bloody nowhere, he grabbed me and shoved me into this cardboard box that he'd cut holes in.\n\nI was so scared. I started crying.\n\nI'd heard him use the word \"vet\" on the telephone a bit earlier that day and I was certain that that had something to do with me. There was also a later phone call where he told one of his friends \"I'm not going to raise a litter of damn kittens\" which confused me to no end.\n\nSometimes, when things go down faster than you can manage, the only thing you can do is cry like a baby. And as soon as I realized the cardboard box thing wasn't a game, and it and me got put inside a stuffy car, I knew there was going to be trouble.\n\nEvery three seconds, I let out a pathetic cry. Joe was timing them! I continued for what seemed like hours but was in fact about ten minutes until we got to the vet's office.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Joe kept saying softly, \"Princess, everything is going to be OK, darling. It's OK, sweetie pie. My honey bunch. My precious little girl.\" But I knew it wasn't going to be OK and that he was in for a shock — a really big one. It would be one of those moments when a human's face turns all red and his or her eyes bulge out.\n\nJoe carried the box with me inside it into the waiting room. He opened it up and sat me on his lap. I was too scared to do anything so I shut up. There was this large blue bird in a cage with enormous feet and talons. It had this gigantic beak and its squawk was louder than a flock of crows. Its owner was a woman who kept staring at me trying to get Joe involved in a conversation. I was fine on his lap but that noisy bird upset the sick dog on a leash across from us whose owners, a man and his son, kept trying to calm down. This critter was missing whole patches of fur from his back. I didn't know what was up with that but I certainly did not want that disease. I leaned up against Joe and pretended to be invisible.\n\nSometime later, a young lady handed Joe a clipboard and told him to fill the forms out. He scribbled the best he could as I was now attempting to disappear inside his arm pit. The further away from this group I could get the better.\n\nShe came back shortly and said, \"Follow me.\"\n\nJoe carried me into this tiny room. She closed the door and we just sat there. Joe let me explore the exam table and then walk around on the floor a bit. I must have smelled about 20 different cats. It was as confusing as the perfume counter at a department store. (Of course, I don't know what that would smell like but I've heard people talk.) The door opened and in walked the lady vet. She put me on the table and said, \"Hello Princess.\" And began to press her warm hands on my neck and then on my back and then on my belly and then my hips and then my … she stopped suddenly.\n\n\"Princess?\" she said looking over at Joe. \"You better pick another name. This is a neutered male.\"\n\n\"It can't be,\" Joe replied. \"All my friends said it was a female. These people have owned cats for years! They all agreed she was a she.\"\n\n\"No way,\" she laughed. \"In a male, the anus is about an inch from the penis. In a female it's much closer. Joe, this is a very well fed boy kitty.\" She squeezed open my mouth which I still don't care for and looked at my teeth. He appears to be maybe a little older than a year or so.\"\n\nThe gentle vet gave me a round of shots which pricked at first. I got something for leukemia, feline AIDS, and rabies.\n\n\"He's got fleas, too. So buy something for them at the front desk,\" she said firmly.\n\nShe scratched my head. \"Goodbye. Boy Truskot. You're lucky to have found a good home.\" And then said to Joe. \"You'll need to buy a proper cat carrier, too. They're not that expensive and you'll find you'll use it a lot. Do get something for those fleas. You won't want them in your house.\"\n\nWell, there it was. Joe's face was still red — he thought he was knowledgeable about nature but certainly got this wrong. It wasn't entirely his fault the mistake was made. He never owned a cat, never ever had a pet. And his friends just all went along.\n\nI cried all the way home again too, this time thinking, \"What if he doesn't want me anymore? What if he only wants a female? Winter is coming and I hate being cold and outside.\"\n\nSo, when we got back to the house. Joe opened the box and I jumped out. He went to the cupboard and put some fish flavored treats in a bowl and set them next to my indoor water bowl.\n\n\"Good kitty,\" he said. Well, that was encouraging.\n\nI just looked at him though and still felt sad. It wasn't at all my fault. I always preferred the attention I got from his lady friends — way more than those noisy guy pals of his.\" I was a natural born ladies' man.\n\nI finished my treats and then just sat and stared at Joe as he examined all the supplies he bought. They included Frontline, flea powder, a flea collar, a flea comb, and — boy, do I have a story coming your way about this last item — flea shampoo.\n\n\"Well\" he said \"What am I going to call you? Max, Rocket, Dil, Rex, No.\" He opened the sliding door for me and I thought it was best to go outside but I hesitated just a moment and looked up at him sympathetically. I really do appreciate all he's done for me so I gave him a head butt on the leg and headed for the door. What could I do if others jumped to the wrong conclusion?\n\n\"C'mon, buddy, let's go outside,\" he said and I did. \"My buddy, hmmm. Buddy is a good name.\"\n\nAnd this is what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 7\n\nOut with pink, in with rawhide\n\nDuring the next few days, Joe changed.\n\nNow that he realized I was a neutered male and that it was his, and his friends’ fault I was misidentified, he felt he had to rectify the situation. So he chose to address me in a deeper voice!\n\n“Well, Bud,” he’d say. “What’s on your agenda today?”\n\nWhen his visitors came by to see me, he told them. “Oh, my Buddy. He’s such a jock. He doesn’t just walk around the couch to get to the other side, he runs in a straight line up and over the couch and on into the bedrooms. Why just the other day,” he continued, “I watched Bud walk along the top of the fence boards. Not the side railing, mind you, but the very top end of the boards. And you know what he figured out? If he does this over by the garage at night, he’s out of range of the motion detector and he can surprise whatever creature happens to be in the back yard without the light coming on!”\n\nAll of which just happens to be true but Joe thought it was necessary to emphasize my athletic prowess — he only knew half of what I could do, and often did.\n\nYes, I had endured the endless “Princess” gushing and now I was well into my butchification program.\n\nThe ‘Hello Kitty’ pink flannel baby blanket was replaced by a colorful, but badly tattered, weaving from Mexico. The rhinestone collar continued to stay in the drawer where he parked a few weeks back. (It reappeared months later but I’ll tell you about that in a few weeks.) My plastic food dish was replaced by earthenware bowls, hand thrown in his pottery class.\n\nHalloween approached and Joe’s extra effort to shore up his new understanding of me resulted in his selecting a tough guy costume for me. I became John Wayne. My cowboy gear came complete with a hat for my head and a blue bandanna tied around my neck. He’d actually spent time looking for a six-shooter and holster that would fit around my narrow hips but couldn’t find them in Salinas. Ditto four leather boots made for cat feet.\n\nI amazed myself with how much I could put up with for free room and board.\n\nSeveral of the early trick-or-treaters laughed at my costume but then so many of them started coming to the door that Joe couldn’t find time to adjust my hat every second. He didn’t see me pull it off and swat it under the couch.\n\nI liked the bandanna though and purposely walked about the living room like I was bow-legged from riding a horse all day, much to everyone’s delight and laughter. I liked the attention and the occasional scratches on the head and, you know, my John Wayne wasn't half bad.\n\nEventually, I rode shotgun for Joe by sitting on top of his wing back chair and policing the strangers as they came for free candy. A couple of the trick-or-treaters brought along their dogs which I didn’t appreciate so I jumped off the chair back and retired to the bedroom for the rest of the evening.\n\nA few days later, Joe and I were watching television in the big bedroom. I was never particularly interested in TV as there were no smells associated with it. But I enjoyed just laying around next to Joe as he looked at the exotic scenery.\n\nI mentioned earlier that he loved nature programs. He often made me snooze through endless hours of whales and porpoises — mammals who gave up their comfy life on land to eat fish (good!) and live in water all the time (bad!). They couldn’t go back now even if they tried. I mean really — have you seen the elephant whales on the beach at Año Nuevo? Graceful isn’t a word I’d use!\n\nThen there were millions of penguins. They may technically be birds, but waddling around on ice sheets and diving into frozen oceans — real birds just don’t do that.\n\nOne night, for some reason, Joe thought I should pay particular attention to a program about African lions.\n\n“Look, Bud,” he said and held my head toward the TV screen. He actually forced me to watch.\n\n“See, they're your cousins,” he said.\n\nThen, this big male lion started vocalizing, calling to others in the pride in that guttural and growling dialect we recognize as a roar. It shook the entire bedroom. Yes, they’re my cousins and I know enough of their brutal language to understand they weren’t saying, “Hello honey pie.”\n\nJoe let go of me and my eyes stayed glued to the TV screen. It was riveting at first. And then this monster of a male, this enormous beast started his monologue. “C’mon gang, let’s go kill and eat the guy taking these pictures ... and that fat house cat back in his truck.” That I couldn’t take anymore.\n\nI turned to Joe and he saw the frightened look on my face.\n\nJoe started laughing — laughing! I was too scared to do anything but jump down off the bed, run to the dining room and hide on a chair underneath the table cloth. I had nightmares for a week after that and avoided that room even when the TV was off. I still haven’t watched another nature program.\n\nAnd then, here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 8\n\nPoor little birdie, traffic training\n\nJoe was on the patio still making his way through “Out of Africa.” I told you he was a slow reader. He was at the part when Karen Blixen gets sick and has to go back to Denmark and the coffee plantation is in peril. He looked sad so I thought I’d cheer him up.\n\nI was lying underneath the birdbath in the dappled light that makes me almost invisible. When this plump little spitzy flew down for a drink and a quick bath, I waited patiently and just when she took off, I leaped into the air, turned upside down, grabbed her with my front paws, shoved her in my mouth, and landed gracefully on all four feet. I trotted back to the patio — spitzy secure in my jaws and very much alive-o. I pranced over to Joe to show him what I just caught.\n\n“Cheeep! Cheeep!” the bird cried, immobilized and held securely in my fangs.\n\nThen it happened.\n\n“Oh, poor little birdie,” Joe said.\n\nImmediately, I knew this wasn’t going to go like I thought it would.\n\nJoe grabbed me and squeezed my jaws open. The spitzy flew across the yard.\n\nI struggled free and raced after it, but she’d taken off quickly and flew a little too high to grab again.\n\nI ran back to Joe and for the first time in our history together raised my voice to him.\n\n“You let it go,” I shouted. “ You jerk!” I raced back to the lawn only to return quickly. “I can’t believe it. You let it go. I caught it and was going to share it with you and you ... let ... it ... go.”\n\nI went off fuming, scaled the 7-foot-back fence and disappeared for the rest of the day in Old Wes’ yard, next door.\n\nJoe looked for me around sunset but I was too angry to return. He peeked over the fence and saw me sitting on a table next to Wes who was looking at a magazine while scratching my head. Served Joe right.\n\nThe next day, we had a conversation. This little chat is one many in my pride have had to have with their owners. It goes like this, “I’m a cat. I kill birds. It’s what I do.”\n\nAs obvious as that is to us, it needs to be understood by all cat owners. If a human wants something dull, harmless and domesticated, go get an ungulate.\n\nAlas, humans are only half logical. They think by anthropomorphizing pets, we’re going to drop our instincts and behave like them.\n\nIf Joe didn’t want me to chase birds, why was he tempting me by filling the bird feeder every few days. Bird seed is what we cats refer to as “bait.”\n\nI think the discussion was worth the effort as that was the last bird Joe pried out of my strong jaws.\n\nThat was back in my prime when my jaws were in fact strong. This morning, for instance, I brought a bird into the house that had crashed into a window and I managed to catch. I don’t know how it happened but once I got it in the living room my old jaws were just too weak to hold on to it, especially with all that fluttering. It got loose and was banging into windows, perching on picture frames and clinging onto blinds. It created more noise than even I expected. Joe is accustomed to loose birds in the house by now and has worked out a quick little maneuver using a broom that coaxes the bird into the wild blue yonder — much to its delight. Yes, it’s been awhile since I have been able to leave a nice pile of feathers behind the philodendron.\n\nIt’s now time to talk about the front yard. It’s quite different from the one in the back and is routinely trafficked by outsiders — human, canine, avian, and feline. The front lawn has been the scene of several incidents which involve me and in their different ways were terrifying.\n\nCars and trucks rumble and race up and down Chaparral Street all day and a good part of the night. People walk dogs, push strollers, and accompany children heading off to the elementary school around the corner. There’s always lots to see and smell. It’s busier than other streets in the neighborhood because it’s a short cut between North Main and Natividad Road. Joe knows its danger to pets from personal experience — having nearly squashed two Chihuahuas who darted out in front of him on his way home from work one night.\n\nPart of a cat’s attraction to the street is our insatiable desire to smell car tires. And there are lots of them in our neighborhood. The closest comparison that humans might understand is their own universal delight in learning the most horrendous things about the most impeccable people — “He was discovered doing what with whom?”\n\nJoe frequently lectured me about crossing the street. “Stay on this side,” he would tell me, “don’t you go over there.”\n\nI mostly ignored Joe as you probably guessed.\n\nOne evening, he looked outside and spotted me under one of the neighbor’s trucks ... across the street.\n\n“Lots of interesting smelling tires over here,” I’d been thinking.\n\nThen Joe came to the curb and called, “Buddy, Buddy, come back here.” Which, of course, I heeded not and continued smelling each tire. There were a lot of cars and the story the tires told me was getting really exciting.\n\n“Get over here,” Joe interrupted.\n\n“Well, if he had just left me alone,” I thought, “I would have gotten bored eventually and returned.”\n\nA car sped by between us, going faster than it should have.\n\nJoe’s face got pale.\n\nA pickup truck rattled passed from the other direction with a motorcycle right behind it.\n\nSniff, sniff. Oh, somebody’s in heat. Oooo, somebody’s after her.\n\n“Get over here right now!” Joe said in his lowest, meanest and most exasperated voice.\n\nSo I trotted back to the curb. Stopped. Looked up the street. Stopped. Looked down the street. Coast clear. I sauntered back to Joe uttering a cute little teasing, “Meow” as I walked past him and headed toward the house.\n\nJoe followed me, opened the front door and we both went in. We sat together for a while but it was warm out that night and I didn’t want to stay inside. I convinced Joe to let me out in the back yard again and he went to bed.\n\nAround 2 in the morning, a car slammed on its brakes, skidded across the pavement, and crashed into several parked ones across the street. Joe bolted upright in bed and in a panic shouted, “Buddy!”\n\nHere’s what Joe did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 9\n\nWahumff, fump, fump\n\nThe noise from the car crash in the middle of the night wouldn’t stop. Joe jumped up from his bed and peeked between the blinds to see what happened.\n\nA car was sitting in the middle of the street in front of the house — upside down. Its lights were on but pointing out in different directions. Its wheels were still spinning around — out of sync with the incessant and very loud rap music. A confused cloud of dust, steam and exhaust swirled about the crash site as if looking for a safe place to settle down.\n\nFrom the passenger’s side window which faced the house, Joe watched as an arm and then slowly the rest of a man struggled to climb out of the car. The CD player blasted out full volume with the bass turned up and the speakers vibrating the night air and the ground itself. “Wahumff, fump, fump; wahumff, fump, fump; wahumff, fump, fump … endlessly.”\n\nThe man extricated himself and leaned against the crashed car for a moment, then he staggered a bit. His entire body shook for a second. unexpectedly, he punched the side of the car, scolding it for its reckless behavior and demonstrating the level of his intelligence. He shook himself again and found his bearings. He stood firmly upright on the pavement, apparently sorting out the situation. He looked up the street and then down the street and then took off running toward Main Street with a “feets do yo’ stuff” impetus.\n\nJoe grabbed the phone in the bedroom, dialed 911 and reported the accident. He put on his flip-flops then opened the front door and went out to investigate.\n\n“Meow,” I said as he stepped out on the front sidewalk. I thankfully had been searching the rooftop for a rat I had smelled earlier and was well away from the street, but I saw the entire thing happen so Joe wasn't just making this column up.\n\n“You just stay up there,” Joe said brusquely and hurried over to see if anyone else was in the car.\n\nOf course, I had no intention of getting involved. I’m a cat. We run from accidents ... too!\n\nThe scene was surreal though. The car lights were on, each shining in a different direction. Fluids were dripping onto the pavement. The air smelled of anti-freeze, burned tires, strangers, and gin 'n' juice. And the CD player droned on and on, blasting out rap. It was the first time Joe ever listened long enough to hear the singer’s actual words. “I took my pole and I shoved it in …” and so on with absolutely nothing else left to the imagination.\n\nTwo teenagers who lived across the street also came out in their pajamas to investigate the accident.\n\n“Is anyone in there?” one asked Joe as he tried to see inside the dark car.\n\nThe headlights stuck on high beam pretty much blinded them.\n\n“I can’t see anything so I don’t think so,” Joe said, then added. “I phoned the police and they should be here soon. Let me go get a flashlight though.” He walked back into the house and searched the hall closet for one.\n\nAlthough I stayed motionless up on the roof, I’ve heard Joe tell this story to his friends over and over again so I know what happened next.\n\nRemember, it was the middle of the night and Joe wasn’t totally awake. After searching around in the hallway closet, he found the flashlight he was looking for, tested it — the batteries worked — then turned suddenly and smacked his head right into the sharp edge of the closet door.\n\n“Ouch,” he cried and uttered angrily one or two of the seven words I was told never to put in my column.\n\nHe got to about the middle of the sidewalk and I saw him reach up and rub his forehead.\n\n“Oh Christ,” he said. “It’s blood.”\n\nHe shined the light inside the car and announced to the girls that the man had been by himself.\n\nThe neighbors stood around for a moment but they got cold and were perhaps embarrassed to listen to this song while standing beside a neighbor they really didn’t know very well. Anyway, they said goodnight and went back home.\n\nThe music was incessant but Joe wasn’t about to climb into the crime scene and attempt to turn that brutal noise off. So he stood there staring at the wrecked car. It was a late-model Camaro — bright red and still sending out clouds of steam.\n\nWith all this commotion, I forgot about the rat, mostly. In my experience rodents piddle then take off as soon as there is any sign of humans approaching. Still, there are few things as tasty as a warm rat liver – which as you might expect is lost on humans.\n\nJoe rubbed his forehead again and noticed how sticky it was, but he stood looking at the wrecked car mesmerized by its obnoxious intrusion into the once quiet night.\n\nWith events as traumatic and unexpected as this, it’s important to take a time-out, sit quietly and review the facts.\n\nIt’s 2:30 in the morning.\n\nThere’s no one around but Joe.\n\nAn upside down Camaro is sitting in front of Joe’s house with its lights and music still on.\n\nThe police are on their way.\n\nAnd Joe’s bleeding.\n\nAbout five minutes later, a police car pulled up (Code 2) and noticed Joe.\n\n“We’re going to block off the street,” he told Joe from the patrol car. He spoke in that wide-awake tone common to people who regularly work a night shift. Two more squad cars showed up. The latter two positioned themselves with their lights spinning at either end of the block and diverted any further traffic.\n\nJoe stood on the sidewalk watching the policemen do their stuff. Because the driver’s side of the Camaro was resting against the parked cars it had side swiped, no one could get to the controls to turn off the lights and music. So everyone had to endure the ordeal.\n\n“Looks like he got too close to one of those parked cars and then overcompensated and that flipped him,” the officer said matter-of-factly as he walked over to Joe and thankfully didn’t flash a light in my owner's face.\n\n“I’ve called for a flat bed,” the cop said. “Did you see what he looked like?”\n\nJoe described a guy in his 20s or 30s, medium build, wearing black.\n\nAs they chatted and waited around, the Camaro's battery started to die and the officer told Joe that he should go back inside.\n\nWhen I saw Joe heading in, I thought that it was time for me to go in as well. By the time Joe got into the living room, I was at the back door and he let me in.\n\nI could tell Joe was wide awake now. I watched him wash the blood off his face and then turn the TV on — shark week!\n\nSo we sat together on the bed for about a half hour.\n\nThen we both jumped up as someone knocked on the door.\n\nJoe went to open it and I went under the kitchen table.\n\nIt was the police officer who first came to the scene.\n\n“I saw your lights on and I thought I’d give you an update,” he said. “Our call center just heard from someone who appeared to be very out of breath. The guy said, ‘Somebody … ahh huh ahh huh ahh huh … just stole my car.’” He laughed.\n\n“We think it’s rather suspicious because usually when someone steals a car they drive away from the place where they stole the car rather than head right back to where they took the car from,” he said.\n\nThey both laughed and the officer said, “The wrecker’s on its way and we’ll clean up the street after we get it flipped back over and loaded up.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Joe and they said “Goodnight.”\n\nWe went back to the bedroom and the sharks were biting people right through the steel cages. It was a repeat of a program we’d seen before. Joe peeked through the window and watched as the tow company flipped the car over using a winch. They pulled it up on the flatbed, secured it, got out some brooms and cleaned up all the broken glass. The workers waved goodbye to the police and everyone left.\n\nThe street was quiet again.\n\nThe next day Joe and I went outside to get the newspaper and examine the smashed parked cars. Joe looked in the gutter and found a baseball. It must have rolled out of the upside down Camaro.\n\nWhen the neighbors who owned the cars that got hit came out to talk to Joe, they said they had slept through the entire episode, but I don’t see how. Now their two cars had smashed sides. They just shrugged their shoulders and Joe handed them the baseball and said he was sorry.\n\nWe walked slowly back to the house and I noticed Joe looking at the front garden and groaning.\n\nHere’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 10\n\nOrnamental grasses, Persian carpet tassels\n\nYou may remember Joe groaning about the front flower bed at the end of last week’s column. This spot has been a challenge for him since he bought the house 23 years ago as it gets no sunlight and the choices of shade-loving plants are limited. He has placed in that dirt several different botanical specimens over the years.\n\nImpatiens was the first. They’re easy to grow, spread quickly, show an attractive color swatch, but need to be watered and weeded regularly throughout the season. They are quickly killed by the first frost. Then came the ten rhododendrons. These were expensive and caused him to have high hopes for huge fuchsia-colored blossoms sitting on top of a tall evergreen forest of attractive leaves. For three years, however, they sat there barely hanging on, producing no new leaves and even fewer flowers. One by one, they died. He got fed up and yanked the remaining two or three out. Their roots had never bothered to test Salinas’ sweet but rather dense adobe soil. Remember, they once built houses out of this stuff.\n\nThen came the “easy-to-care-for” ornamental grasses. He had selected several types, the common names for which were rainbow grass, fountain grass, feather reedgrass, Japanese forest grass and one or two others. They looked great for two years but eventually got so long and thick they invaded each other and started flopping all over the place. They even spread under the sidewalk and populated areas where they weren’t welcome. One of those varieties even had viable seeds so the lawn was never the same again. Most withered with the first cold snap and turned the front garden into Baghdad after a bombing. They truly needed to be cut back.\n\nSo Joe got out his trash can, sharpened his shears and pulled on his gloves. He started at the side walk end, grabbed a bunch of the 3- to 4-foot-tall grass with the feather-like seed pods on the end, and vigorously started snipping at the base. He only had to do this for about 3 minutes when he noticed agitation in the mound before him. Something was stirring inside the thick grass.\n\nThen, a slow moving white paw emerged from the stems and suddenly swatted his glove. It disappeared back into the mound of long leaves. Joe smiled and continued his pruning.\n\nThe next bunch of grass he grabbed had the most thrilling and fully formed plumes one could pray for. Again, that mysterious white paw came through the thick grass and swiped his gloved hand. He chuckled and continued slicing away at the clump and tossing the dead grass into the recycle container.\n\nJoe was pulling together the next handful of coarse stems when the phantom paw once again intruded his space. Quickly, he dropped the shears and pinched it hard.\n\nIt was my foot!\n\nI let out my best Ninja scream, “urrrr RAYANG gerrrr,” flew three feet into the air, one paw extended and the other cocked back and ready to inflict serious damage on my opponent.\n\nAll Joe could do was laugh hysterically. I landed firmly on the mound, back hips held up high, head and front paws down low on the ground, growling and swaying side-to-side ready for my next death-inflicting attack.\n\nJoe now was guffawing with tears in his eyes. He was holding his stomach and groaning with laughter. My prey distracted, I decided to pounce. So I leaped into the air and managed a four-paw landing on his arm — claws retracted, of course. Then, I darted away. I was glad I could so easily amuse this man.\n\nI thought I better go hide again as here was Joe laying sprawled out on the ground in the front yard laughing uncontrollably. He was in full view of the neighborhood. Not that I cared much about people’s opinion but I was in a certain manner worried for him. They take people away and lock them up for observation for less than this. It’s called 5150 in police jargon. He might indeed be a danger to himself.\n\nWhen he regained his composure, he looked about for me and I was sitting on a rock over in the sun. He teased me with a rather long specimen of feather-top grass and I couldn’t resist. We played for about five minutes then I got tired of jumping up and down and demolishing the strands of grass and Joe sighed again and looked at the bed only a quarter of which had been cleaned out.\n\nThen I got sad as Joe continued to hack down more grass. I couldn’t pretend I was a Bengal tiger out there anymore but I understood that winter was coming and the garden needed to be tidied up before the rains started.\n\nFrom this little event Joe became convinced that one could not claim to be a true garden enthusiast without having a cat by one’s side. Plants grow better with a cat wandering around among them. It’s a known fact.\n\nI loved the front yard and enjoyed it being a sort of crossroads. I played at being a school guard watching and protecting the children who walk by going to class every morning. They were very regular and I like that — walked one way just before 8 a.m. and walked the other way sometime after 2 p.m. I usually missed the return journey as it conflicts with my sleep time.\n\nFor all of Joe’s good nature in nature, I can’t say that he laughed much when I tried a few ninja maneuvers in the house.\n\nIt was relatively soon after I started to spend more time indoors that I got my first true scolding.\n\nJoe was cooking and doing dishes at the sink in the kitchen. I wanted to play and noticed that his Persian carpet under the dining room table had these long tassels — sort of like the feather top grass I loved. Well, I laid down on my side and grabbed a fist full of tassels in my front paws and used my back ones to rip at the ones down there.\n\n“Hey,” Joe shouted, “Cut that out.”\n\nI stopped, jumped up and walked to the kitchen door. Joe paid no attention. I sat still for a moment watching him chop vegetables but quickly got bored. I then turned my head. My eyes fell on the fringe and I had to dive for it. Once again, I was on my side, hooked on with my front and scratching as fast as I could with back legs.\n\n“Dammit, I said stop that,” Joe yelled but I paid no attention and continued. Suddenly, I was hit in the face with a wet dish rag which was quite a messy shock. So I ran behind the couch and hid. I watched Joe pick up the towel and toss it back in the sink.\n\nI don’t know. I just don’t know. I suppose if there was a cat equivalent of thumb-sucking, bed-wetting, nail-biting in humans; there was a rug fringe annihilating in cats.\n\nYep. Joe’s back in the kitchen. I’m behind the couch. I look out. I see tassels. Vavoom — I’m on ‘em and trying my best to rip ‘em to shreds.\n\n“You little sh*t!” Joe said in his lowest and meanest voice. He ran over to me, grabbed me by my scruff, and slapped my head soundly. “What did I tell you?”\n\nI wailed.\n\nMiserable groans came from deep inside me and my whole body shook. He didn’t actually hit me very hard but it was more how startled I was that I reached his limit. I also felt bad about not being able to control myself and that I had disappointed Joe. I stood in the middle of the living room and cried out loud.\n\nThis outburst took Joe quite by surprise and soon he was next to me, picking me up and sitting me on his lap. He started in about how sorry he was but I just kept crying.\n\nLater, I overheard Joe tell his friends he was doing his best “not to laugh” because I was behaving so much like a two-year-old.\n\nWell folks, you do the math!\n\nWhile I was sitting on Joe’s lap and he was soothing me he noticed my fur. Now that winter was coming and I would be in the house more, I might have to be a little cleaner. He decided he needed to know more about cats and baths.\n\nSo here’s what he did next … to be continued.\n\nColumn 11\n\nRub-a-dub-dub, bad advice\n\nI was sleeping in the sun on the patio, dreaming of a land of endless delights where tuna water ran in the streams, dishes were full of crunchy treats, and all the plants in the garden smelled of intrigue. I heard the patio door slide open and watched Joe approach through one half-opened eye. He got closer and I opened both eyes. He reached down and lifted me up, kissed the top of my head, and then looked at my feet and hind legs. OK, they were a little muddy.\n\nJoe carried me into the house with his arms extended and my hind legs dangling. His voice continuously making soothing sounds. We turned the corner and entered the bathroom. The shower curtain was pulled to one side. A stack of towels rested on the vanity. A bottle of flea shampoo was on the bathtub rim. The tub was full of warm water. I knew what was coming and let out a low, sad groan.\n\nSplash! Into the water I was plunged and immediately fought against this indignant and terrifying ordeal. But Joe’s got big hands and they were not going to let go no matter how much of the bath water I was able to swish out of the tub and onto him. His hands are so large just one of them can hold me tightly while the other dumped this awful smelling shampoo on my neck and back.\n\n“Oooo,” he said, “You’re gonna smell so nice and clean.”\n\nThat’s no consolation, no comfort. I cried in that low and pathetic tone cats muster when escape is out of the question.\n\n“We just can’t have you bringing all that mud in the house. Can we?” he asked.\n\nThe shampoo and water did their trick and I was now covered in foamy wet fur. Joe massaged and scrubbed and rinsed and scrubbed some more and all the shampoo he dumped on me kept foaming and foaming up.\n\nI wriggled and writhed and managed up stir up a bath tub tsunami which hit its target dead on.\n\nJoe drained the tub as the bath water was now filthy, foamy and thick with hair. OK, I was shedding a bit but he would not let go of me however much I fought. He managed to turn the bathtub tap on and test it. Then, he used his free hand to cup the water and splash it up against me to rinse out the foam. This took too long. So he held on to me with two hands moved me right under the gushing spigot. I remember wriggling a lot but not much else.\n\nHe paused for a moment to notice how tiny my body actually is when I’m soaking wet.\n\n“OK, Bud, we’re nearly done now.”\n\nHe turned off the water tap and using his hand like a squeegee, he put me through the spin cycle.\n\nReaching behind him, he grabbed a fluffy towel and covered me with it.\n\nIn one quick motion, he lifted me and the towel up, grabbed the other towels and walked back out to the patio. One towel absorbed most of the water. The second one quickly twirled over me and the third sat on his legs.\n\nSlowly Joe moved the towel up and down my back trying to dry my fur off. All four legs and paws got a good rubbing as did my head, neck, belly and backside. Throughout this procedure I was quiet and patient and even purred softly.\n\nJoe replaced the second towel with a dry fourth one and vigorously rubbed me all over. That’s when I started my low growl. When he was rough with my back legs which are sensitive, I hissed and spit in his face.\n\nHe put me down on the patio and picked up the wet towels. Joe was now wetter than I was. I sat in the sun for a few minutes rearranging my fur.\n\nJoe appeared on the patio with a bowl of fish-flavored treats wearing an entirely new set of clothes.\n\nLater in the day, he kept picking me up, hugging me, sticking his nose into my fur and breathing deep.\n\n“You smell so delicious,” he said. Little compensation for the torture I endured.\n\nWeeks passed.\n\nA co-worker of Joe’s who had owned cats his entire life was sympathetic when Joe related to him how difficult my first bath was to carry off. This person must have been testing Joe’s gullibility more than sharing practical advice.\n\nThis happened. It really did. In fact, it’s a primary reason why I thought writing this column might be good — a sort of public service warning about what not to do.\n\nHere goes.\n\nThe garden was wet after a lengthy early morning rain. I was outside and particularly bored. I wanted to play. A fat rat proved to be the right vehicle for my entertainment. Off I went on its trail. The hunt, however, brought me into direct contact with terra not-so-firma. It was pretty mucky out back. I admit so was I and I gave up.\n\nJoe was finishing his first cup of coffee so it was early. He noticed me trying to wash myself on the patio and how muddy I was.\n\n“C’mon Bud,” Joe said, “Let’s take a shower together.” That was the “friend’s” advice!\n\nJoe picked me up, carried me into the bathroom and placed me on the sink countertop. I watched him take off his T-shirt and running shorts and hang them on the hook behind the door which he closed. He reached behind the curtain, turned on the water and adjusted the temperature. Then swung around and picked me up.\n\nHe was as cheerful as ever, “We’re going to have a nice warm shower.”\n\nI knew where this was going and saw shock and awe written all over it. I gave him no assurance I was going to go quietly. I growled and hissed. Still he pressed me against his warm chest, pulled the curtain back, and into the tub he stepped closing the curtain behind us.\n\n“Here we go,” he said and stepped forward into the shower spray.\n\nThe moment the first drop of water touched my ear, my claws went directly into Joe’s flesh. He screamed. My back paws dug into Joe’s belly and gave me enough of a ledge to jump up onto his head with my hind legs digging into his shoulders and my front ones buried deeply into his scalp. I completely obscured his face and he staggered about in the stream of water — my belly smack up against his cheeks.\n\nJoe, poor guy, was not only startled by the suddenness of these events but was now also blind and in considerable pain.\n\nHe turned quickly to try and pull me off his head but unfortunately his knee hit the shower’s “On” lever and turned the tap to cold.\n\nI decided he was no longer stable — hmmmm! — and I wasn’t going to go down with the ship. So I jumped for the rod holding up the shower curtain. It’s only mounted there by a pressure coil. Once hit by a 10-pound soaking wet, very angry feline, it’s coming down.\n\nAnd down it went.\n\nI road it like a surfer until it crashed into the toilet tank knocking a soap dish onto the floor and box of tissue into toilet. I leaped onto the sink counter but slid across it and toppled over the toothbrush holder sending the toothbrushes and toothpaste onto the now soaking wet rug. Then, I jumped down to the floor and hid in the corner by the door.\n\nJoe stood naked in the tub shivering and bleeding. He turned the water off and looked down at the scratches and muddy paw prints on his chest, arms and shoulders. He touched his sore scalp. It was bleeding and throbbing.\n\nThe entire bathroom looked like Katrina had blown through. A soaking wet shower curtain covered half the mess. Even the towels which he had so carefully stacked to dry me off were sodden with the spray from the shower head.\n\nJoe looked at the clock. It was 12 to 8. He sighed deeply, bent over and lifted up the shower curtain and rod. He adjusted the pressure coil inside the rod and rehung the curtain. Turned the water back on and took a long and steamy shower. When he finished, he found a partially dry towel, put his clothes back on and started putting things in order.\n\nHe lifted me up, wiped the mud off my paws with a wet towel and dried me with a little hand towel that was saved from the downpour. He opened the door and I ran out to the patio again. The sun was now up and I found a warm place to finish drying off.\n\nHe was very distant for the rest of the day and kept the doors shut.\n\nAround suppertime, he opened the sliding door and offered me some kibbles — Fancy Feast’s Filet Mignon and Shrimp flavor — the best.\n\nAnd here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 12\n\nA Good Luck Symbol\n\nThe best thing Joe did, and this holds true to this very day, is stop taking advice from other cat owners.\n\nI loved being outside and, when it was truly miserable weather, I joined Joe inside. If he wasn’t around and I was inside, I just slept the day away and made certain I didn’t disrupt anything.\n\nAny project Joe might get involved in, I was right there offering interest, encouragement and occasionally sympathy — he wasted a lot of time on projects that didn’t quite work out. Take for example the organizer for nuts, bolts, nails and screws that he made out of empty baby food jars. He thought I might enjoy “baby’s first meal.” But I immediately tried to bury that crap and he gave up on trying to feed it to me. The organizer worked for awhile but the threads on the lids got too loose and with the weight of the contents fell down on their own. They scared me to death when they dropped and made Joe think I was somehow responsible.\n\nOne day, we were pulling weeds from under a rose bush when one fell down of its own accord and proved my innocence.\n\nMy favorite of Joe’s creations were the ditches he dug around his rose beds in the back yard. He told folks that he made them to add vertical interest to the garden beds. But, truthfully, he created these trenches to facilitate drainage. When he moved into his house, his back yard was much lower than his front. It was even lower than his neighbors’ yards which adjoined it. Every time one of those wet storms came down from Alaska, the backyard flooded. The clay soil turned to muck and stayed wet and soggy for days. So over the years, Joe hauled in mulch and top dressing, wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow, to cover the garden beds — and elevate them. The ditches, too, had to be maintained to make certain they were deep enough for the water to flow out, around the side of the house, into the front yard and down into the street.\n\nDuring most of the dry year, however, these little arroyos were a perfect place for me to hide. The birds at the feeder in the middle of the lawn were never expecting an attack from the ditch.\n\nJoe learned how to find me by scanning the edge of the green lawn looking for one white ear and one black ear sticking up.\n\nI’d mentioned Old Wes before. He was the fellow who lives next door to Joe. He, too, lives by himself but unlike Joe, he is home all day long. Best thing about Wes and his yard is the absence of dogs and other cats. There was just me, and then only as an afternoon visitor. Wes didn’t mind me stopping by to see him as he sat on his patio reading the newspaper. As soon as someone came to visit him, though, I took off. I wasn’t interested in knowing any more human beings.\n\nIt was Wes who told Joe about my unusual bird hunting technique. I’d sit up on the roof and wait for the spitzies to fly between the houses. Sparrows and finches always look down when they fly, searching for food or a decent place to land. So I’d time my leap from the eaves just perfectly and hit them from above, hold onto them with my jaws and land on all fours in front of Wes. That impressed him.\n\nOf course, I don’t recommend this to your cats as many of those six- and seven-foot landings have eaten up eight of my nine lives. Ouch!\n\nMy hind legs are close to useless these days. I’m so stiff I can’t even twist around to groom myself. I still moan and groan during the baths which are much more frequent now because they have to be, but Joe is also much better at giving them. He uses off-brand baby shampoo which is easier to rinse off in the tub and still makes me smell fresh. He no longer wastes $48 on 8 ounces of specialized feline dandruff reduction shampoo.\n\nMoney means something to Joe. I’ve always felt its only value was to make life more comfortable right here, right now. Humans place importance on things of value.\n\nOne night, Joe was watching another of his nature programs on TV. This one was particularly riveting for him as it was all about cats! He learned about our relatively late domestication. Dogs, horses, and cows have us cats beat by several millennia. He saw film clips of our closest relatives —Asian wild cats — and our recent explosion of popularity, overtaking our rivals in the pet world. You know who.\n\nJoe listened carefully as the program’s narrator, in dark and deep tones, recited a list of breeds with representational photos.\n\n“Through the course of the domestication of the house cat,” the narrator noted, “man has used his breeding talent to create and accentuate certain feline characteristics. This has resulted in the creation of several distinct breeds whose characteristics fit a predetermined standard. Most popular are the Siamese, the Persian, the Abyssinian. There’s also the Russian blue, Maine coon, Cornish Rex, and … Japanese bobtail.”\n\nJoe’s jaw dropped.\n\n“Japanese bobtail!” He’d never heard of that breed before, had never seen a picture of this ancient type of Oriental house cat. The show ended.\n\nImmediately, Joe turned off the TV and fired up his computer. He did a quick search of Japanese bobtail on the internet and pulled up a photo gallery featuring pictures of them. He was stunned as he looked through the photos.\n\n“Buddy,” was all he uttered.\n\nHe ran to the back bedroom where I had fallen sound asleep — well, with Joe around, I wouldn’t call any of my sleep truly sound. At any rate, he lifted me up, carried me over to the computer and set me on the desktop.\n\nHe looked at the screen and read, “Eyes more oval than round.”\n\nLooked me in the face, “Yep,” he said.\n\nReturned to the screen, “Ears wide apart and standing straight at 45 degrees to the face,”\n\n“That too,” he said.\n\n“Back legs a little longer than front ones.”\n\nHe pulled me around and tugged on my legs, “Got it,” he said.\n\n“Predominantly white with black or calico spots, but could be any color.”\n\n“Definitely,” he nodded.\n\n“Very vocal.”\n\n“Bud can’t keep his mouth shut,” he whispered.\n\n“The bobtail usually has anything from a stub to a short tail with a kink.”\n\nHe felt mine.\n\n“Stub,” he said.\n\nThat was enough pokin’ ‘n’ proddin’ for me. I struggled and Joe let me jump down. I headed outside and he kept on reading.\n\n“Brought to this country from Japan in 1968. Quickly became popular. Ancient breed of street cat in Japan. The calico, called ‘mi-ke,’ is most prized. The breed features in a legend that runs more or less like this. It was said that once a man was eating at a restaurant and spotted a Japanese bobtail outside. The cat stared at him intensely and raised its front paw. The man got up to see the cat and scratch its head. Just as he touched the cat, the heavy wooden beam above the chair where he was sitting gave way and came crashing down.”\n\nThank you Mr. Cat.\n\nThe Japanese bobtail is that friendly ceramic, paw-raised cat that sits on check-out counters at Chinese and Japanese restaurants. It’s a symbol of good luck. Sometimes with a clock in its belly, sometimes with a mechanical paw that waves hello. It was also the inspiration for the ‘Hello Kitty’ image.\n\nJoe poked around on the internet and found a breeder with an 831 telephone number. That dealer listed Japanese bobtail kittens on her website at $600 a piece!\n\nWhen next he saw me, Joe lifted me up, stared into my face and said, “You’re worth $600, Buddy boy!”\n\nHis entire demeanor toward me changed. He next showed up with a new stiff metal brush, a soft nylon brush, a flea comb, and several more catnip stuffed mice toys.\n\nAt work, Joe told everyone including people who hate cats that his cat was a “Japanese bobtail.”\n\nFrom this time forward, he rarely referred to me as a cat. When asked by some new acquaintance if he owned a pet, Joe would say, “Yes, I have a Japanese bobtail.” If they looked bewildered — unsure exactly what type of animal that might be, he added, “That’s an ancient breed of cat.”\n\nIf given any encouragement, he’d also add, “He’s worth at least $600.”\n\nNow that my monetary value had been established, Joe didn’t feel so bad about spending the $48 on that ritzy cat dandruff shampoo.\n\n“Just taking care of the investment,” he bragged.\n\n“Investment!” I thought. This fellow does not remember history.\n\nAnd here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 13\n\nThe remodel and a surprise visitor\n\nDuring the first dozen years Joe lived in his house in Salinas, he thought about remodeling his kitchen. His approach was methodical. He sought advice from many friends and knowledgeable people. He jotted down a list of “must-haves” and looked at several home improvement magazines — when I wasn’t sound asleep on top of them. He knew exactly what he hated and would never have in his house, but he wavered a lot on what should happen and when. He knew what shabby things he had to improve but wasn’t certain about the materials or appliances to put into the newly designed kitchen. This would have been 2004 and the offers of home equity loans seemed endless and cheap.\n\nOne of the first consultants to come to our house was Mr. Wayne Dilbeck of Dilbeck & Sons Construction in Salinas. Mr. Dilbeck’s headquarters were located near the storage unit of Joe’s former employer, just off West Rossi Street. So he decided to get in touch with them and was happy when Mr. Dilbeck himself arranged a visit. Joe was thrilled to have such a knowledgeable and experienced man help him.\n\nIt was probably on a Saturday — that’s a tiring day as most of the neighborhood cats are out late the night before, especially when there’s a full moon. I’m always confused at home because that’s the day when everything is off schedule. Joe’s always running about the house and yard doing things, coming and going in his truck, and running the washing machine which is loud and scares me. People occasionally drop by unannounced — at least to me.\n\nAt any rate, Joe’s truck was in the driveway. A much larger truck with a rack over the bed was in front of the house. The garage door was wide open. I’d been out most of the night snooping around the neighborhood picking fights with a couple of ferals who claimed they didn’t know my yard was private property and it took me longer to finish smelling the neighbors' tires. I was exhausted and decided on a short cut.\n\nI heard talk coming from the kitchen and walked into the garage. When I finished checking out that space under the cupboards for rats and mice, I was ready to go indoors.\n\nJoe was chatting with Wayne Dilbeck. The windowless door from the kitchen to the garage was closed shut. I just didn’t have the energy to walk around, climb a fence and deposit myself onto a patio chair.\n\n“I’d like to put in a garden window,” I heard Joe say.\n\n“That’s a standard size space and we can make it fit,” the other voice (Wayne’s) replied.\n\n“When I make coffee and toast at the same time, I blow a fuse,” Joe said.\n\n“Yea, all of the electricity has to be redone to bring it up to code,” Wayne answered.\n\n“Errrr raing,” I interjected from my side of the door.\n\nThey paused.\n\nJoe continued, “I’d like to put in a disposal.”\n\n“That’s easy,” Wayne said, “but we’ll have to take a look at the plumbing. Houses in this neighborhood were built with all the pipes in the concrete slab and that’s not ….”\n\n“Errrr RAING,” I said firmly, thinking maybe they hadn’t heard me.\n\nJoe paid no attention to me and continued talking, “Now, one of the things I want most is a light above the sink. I hate doing dishes in the shadows.”\n\n“ER RAING guh,” I snapped.\n\n“All the electrical will have to be redone, so you can have …” Wayne started and stopped.\n\n“RAING RAING RAING,” I shouted.\n\n“Now let’s talk about counter tops,” Joe said clearly ignoring me, “should I choose granite or something else?”\n\nExasperated, I screamed, “ERRRR RAING GUUUUH.”\n\n“Joe,” Wayne said softly, “I think your cat wants in.”\n\nReluctantly, and a bit embarrassed about my behavior, Joe opened the kitchen door. I slowly stepped inside, looked straight ahead, paid no attention to either men, walked between them, turned the corner and headed out on the patio. I could feel two sets of eyes following me.\n\nTheir conversation lasted another 15 minutes or so and then Wayne said goodbye, got in his truck and drove away.\n\nJoe locked the house and drove away, too.\n\nA few hours later, Joe returned with a package under his arm. It was something called a “Kitty Entrance” and it was supposed to fit snugly next to a sliding door.\n\nWhat began next was Joe’s effort to train me to use a pet door. I understood the concept and walked freely in and out through it — as long as Joe held the flap open for me and there was a treat on the other side.\n\nAs soon as he started pushing my head against that swinging door, my legs flew out straight in front of me, locked into position against the frame, and would not budge. I did not see why I had to push my head against a piece of plastic. Joe was always available to me for that purpose. The game I invented became let’s see how long I can wait before I put my stiff legs out.\n\nVarious incentives — feathered toys, tuna water, treats: hard and soft — were placed before me which I sincerely enjoyed — as long as Joe held that little door open.\n\nJoe tried again a bit later that day and a couple of times more the following day. He was deflated because he thought he could train me to do anything. What I knew that Joe hadn’t quite figured out yet was that he himself likes to come and go freely through this door. The insert fell down every time he swung the glass sliding door open.\n\nIt, the cat door, was soon relegated to a shelf in the garage where I remember sitting on top of it a few times. I don’t know what ever happened to it though in the end.\n\nAnyway, months passed before the remodeling began. I heard Joe say that Mr. Dilbeck was getting so much business he had a hard time fitting us in anytime soon. But, I won’t forget his teaching Joe that immediate cat needs take precedent over dreams of new kitchens.\n\nThe folks from Salinas Valley Appliances which, alas, is no more, showed up, worked with Joe, drew up plans and began destroying the old kitchen.\n\nIn the midst of all these disruptions, Joe had moved the large living room furniture against a far wall, hauled the dining room table and chairs into the back bedroom, rolled up the carpeting and covered everything in bed sheets. It was so much fun to play in that open space and to be able to sit on the top shelf of the bookcase, I just can’t tell you.\n\nIt was during this time. I think it was a Saturday morning again because Joe was home and saw for himself what happened. The kitchen was nearly finished and they were getting ready to repaint the living and dining room. I just happened to be looking out of the picture window into the front yard, when out from the bushes guess who I saw staring back at me?\n\nMy old man!\n\nI’d thought I’d smelled his stink a few days earlier but couldn’t be certain. It had been three years since I left that old lair of his. Now here he was as ugly and pompous as ever. And on the prowl\n\nKnow what he did? He hissed and spit at me. What a greeting!\n\nKnow what I did back? From my side of the window? I snarled and roared as powerfully as I could muster. I had the benefit of the empty room and its echo chamber. What a volume I mustered! It caused his eyes to pop out and he trembled. Ha!\n\n“Look on my might works ye mighty and despair,” I quoted.\n\nJoe came flying into the room amid my growling and roaring to see what was up and saw my tail-less, yellow, mangy papa take off running across the front lawn and down the street, never to be seen again.\n\nHere’s what Joe did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 14\n\nBrooms & exercise\n\nSurprised at seeing a tailless yellow cat at his front picture window and hearing me growling like the king of beasts, Joe stepped out of the front door and I followed closely behind. My old man was heading west on Chaparral Street and we watched him race down the sidewalk. He disappeared in some bushes on the corner of Maryal Drive. I raced over to the liquid amber tree near the curb, sharpened my claws energetically on its trunk and sprinted back into the house passing in front of Joe and winning the gold medal.\n\nMy pop’s surprise visit coincided with one of Joe’s exercise periods. I’ve lived through six of these heart healthy episodes, which usually occurred just before and just after Joe visits his doctor. Joe seemed proud of keeping his numbers down — during those periods.\n\nThat evening, Joe put on some walking shoes and a sweatshirt, locked the house, and headed west. He was thinking again of my old man and wondering where that mean cuss might be holed up these days. I was of no help because I’ve got my own territory to supervise and haven’t strayed very far from the rose garden.\n\nNorth Main Street is too noisy for a contemplative walk so Joe turned onto Noice and headed toward Laurel Drive. Somewhere along this stretch of his exercise route his eyes fell on a gray cat sitting on the top step of one of the houses.\n\nJoe stopped dead in his tracks and stared. The cat looked so much like me. Joe waited. It got up and walked across the front porch. NO TAIL! This cat was predominantly an ash color but had some black and white markings, the same length of fur, the same shape of head and body, and (I’m bragging, please indulge me) the same intelligent eyes. It even returned his stare with a short little “meow,” just like I do all the time.\n\nNo scaredy cats in my family! I’m convinced the cat was my long lost sister. I was thrilled to hear Joe tell his friends about her. He also saw the dirty abandoned garage I once called home. (My handmade quilts are much more comfortable than that greasy ol’ torn towel that was our communal bed and Joe’s hand thrown pottery dishes are certainly steps above the garbage can lid that was our joint trough — even though one or two of Joe’s bowls are a bit lop sided.)\n\nIn subsequent walks, Joe noticed a few other cats wandering in and out of that garage but he never saw my sister again. Each time he peeped about that old lady’s property he saw cats he’d never seen before.\n\nThat was years ago now and the last time Joe walked by that house, maybe last Christmas, the curtains were all pulled shut and the garage door was closed tight. The broken patio furniture was gone. No sign of any cats.\n\nLet’s go back to the remodeled kitchen.\n\nA few days after we chased my dad out of the yard, it was time to put the house back in order. I stayed outside mostly because of the smell of the new paint. But when Joe started moving the furniture back into position I felt I owed him the courtesy of my helping paws and chased the edges of the sheets that covered the chairs and sofa.\n\nDuring this major reshuffling, Joe went to the garage and returned with an old-fashioned straw broom. At seeing it, I panicked and ran toward the door to the patio, but when I got there it was closed. I reversed engines and darted behind the couch trying my best to crawl under it.\n\nJoe stood there with his mouth open and was totally confused. There had never been any episode that involved him, me, and a broom. What could have caused such a panic attack in Buddy, he wondered. He slowly walked over to the sliding door with the broom still in his hand, opened it and moved aside. I recoiled a bit and then darted right through the opening and was soon out on the back lawn and over the fence. Free at last!\n\nThe churning in Joe’s head continued for the remainder of that day. He was sweeping up the lint, dust, and assorted rose leaves and petals that had blown into the house; wiping off the mantle, bookcase shelves and end tables with a damp cloth; and rehanging the lithographs on his walls.\n\nSuddenly, he stopped. His synapses connected and threw him back a couple of years to a comment made by his first cleaning lady — now long since gone. It was a forgotten memory. She was two departed housekeepers back. Her comment finally had significance.\n\nIt went like this, “Kitty-cat no good in house. Kitty-cat go outside. Kitty-cat STAY outside.”\n\nOh, this particular cleaning lady never hurt me with the broom, but she certainly threatened me with it on several occasions, especially that one time when I came in from the garden and my paws were a bit “dusty.” All I did was walk across a wet kitchen floor checking to see if she had mopped up all of the evil smells. She hadn’t quite done that but my inspection was interrupted by the broom smacking me in the rear.\n\nJoe smiled. To this day, I’ve hated the sight of a broom. The vacuum cleaner is another matter. It’s just way too loud. I exit to the garden and wait until it’s quiet again. So I have issues with a few things but they’re minor to my other abilities.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of me, I should also mention another of what Joe describes as my awesome talents. My hearing! I think I’ve mentioned before I can hear a rat scratching from 50 feet away and I can.\n\nIt totally freaks Joe out though when we’re sitting quietly and he’s watching TV and I’m taking a nap and I suddenly do this. I’ll bolt upright, tilt my head and stare toward the front door. Joe notices me, and then the doorbell rings. Meanwhile, Joe hasn’t heard a footstep.\n\nThis has happened several times and Joe continues to be amazed. The postman drops letters in the mailbox, high school band members are selling candy bars, strangers want to talk about home security systems, or evangelicals are inviting him to their congregation. Through it all, I’m right there giving him a signal, someone’s coming!\n\nGiven my extraordinary hearing, Joe finds the reverse side of it aggravating.\n\nHe’ll say “Get out of the way!” to me and I’ll continue to stay in the middle of his path. He’ll say “Buddy, come here quick” and I’ll maybe stare at him, maybe not. He’ll say “OK Bud, it’s time for you to go outside,” and I’ll sigh and close my eyes.\n\nIf this article is about true confessions, I did miss my “someone’s coming” cue just one time, but it was in the middle of the night and, well very serious ...\n\nThis is what happened … to be continued\n\nColumn 15\n\nNight visitors and a wounding insult\n\nJoe had been busy straightening up the house for the entire day. Company was coming. He had invited several people from his office to come over for Halloween which was the following evening.\n\nThe caveat to attending one of Joe’s Halloween parties was this. He would provide dinner and drinks but guests were required to bring all the candy for the hundreds of trick-or-treaters who were inevitably coming to the door. Guests would then help to pass out the candy. No costumes for the guests were required which seemed to delight all of them.\n\nI’ve written about my first costume which was a cowboy. My second costume — and I’m not making this up — was a “show girl.” I’d warned you all about that bejeweled collar reappearing around my neck. This costume he created had a circle of colorful feathers mounted on it and I was supposed to prance Las Vegas-style around the room with my head framed by all these long feathers. Fortunately, gravity was on my side so the weight of the top feathers kept circling around my neck and ending up at my feet making it tricky to walk at all. It wasn’t successful. Joe tried to fix it once or twice and then just gave up and took it off me. There is a God.\n\nAfter I greeted everyone and allowed folks to “ooo” and “ah” over my extraordinary handsomeness and generally gregarious nature, I retired to the bedroom for the remainder of the night. The guests by this time were busy coming and going as were the hundreds of children and their parents who came to the door.\n\nMany kids picked Chaparral Street to walk down because it was flat, non-stop houses from Natividad Road to North Main Street, and most importantly, Sandra, my neighbor about seven houses away, and her family carved 50 or so gigantic pumpkins and invited everyone to walk about them on the front lawn and enjoy the great carving job and the candles. It was a wonderful and generous gesture on their part. They worked in the produce business and had access to these giant pumpkins. Some were three or four feet tall! It was such a special treat for many and I enjoyed hearing about them but there was never time for me to see them for myself. Sandra’s husband became sick one year and the jack-o-lantern period ended.\n\nJoe’s guests loved to come over to see the pumpkins, to enjoy the children’s costumes and to get together over good food and wine.\n\nBut I’m getting way ahead of myself.\n\nJoe was cleaning all day and preparing food that could stay in the refrigerator and be ready to serve the next day. He was exhausted and frankly so was I. Watching Joe go here and there, in the garage, in the back bedroom, outside on the patio, back in the kitchen, was more tiring than you might think. He was always in a hurry making sure that when the guests arrived everything would be ready for them. A cheese board was made up, bowls of nuts were here and there, the table had its leaves put in and was pushed against a wall. Plates, glasses, napkins, utensils all were ready ahead of time so he could spend most of the next day just cooking.\n\nSo when ten or eleven came around, it was “lights out ladies and gentlemen. Time to rest.” It was also a moonless night so I had no interest in wandering the neighborhood looking for troublemakers. We both got onto the bed and fell soundly asleep.\n\nAt around 2 a.m., we heard a rap-rap-rap-rap on the front door. Joe and I jumped up and looked at each other. The knocking continued.\n\nJoe went to the peep hole in the front door and looked out. He’d left the porch light on, fortunately, and could see clearly. He spotted a badge on the arm of one of the people standing there. It read “Salinas Police Department.”\n\nJoe and I immediately sensed something bad had happened. I took off and hid under the dining room table so I could disappear from the eyes of any intruders yet still watch what was going on. Joe opened the door.\n\nImmediately the visitors began to speak.\n\n“We got a call from your wife or girlfriend that you’d had too much to drink and she was afraid you were going to beat her up,” said the uniformed police officer in one long emotionless breath. Standing next to him, was a female officer, also uniformed, and a plain-clothes detective.\n\nJoe paused for what seemed a very long moment while he stared at the law enforcement trio standing on the porch and tried to assess the situation..\n\n“Excuse me,” Joe finally mumbled still partly snoozing.\n\n“We got a call saying you were drinking too much and your wife was afraid of you,” the uniformed officer said again.\n\n“350 Chaparral Street?” Joe questioned incredulously.\n\n“Yes, that’s what she said,” he replied.\n\n“Are sure it wasn’t 350 Chardonnay Street?” Joe asked because he frequently gets mail for that address in his box.\n\n“No sir,” the officer said, “She clearly stated ‘Chaparral.’”\n\n“Maybe she meant ‘315?’” Joe answered trying to figure out the confusion.\n\nThe three members of Salinas’ finest remained at the front door unwilling to give up.\n\n“Oh, for goodness sake,” Joe said pleasantly, “C’mon in.” He reached up and turned the lights on in the living room. Then, walked over to the hallway to the bedrooms and turned those lights on. He then joined the group in the center of the living room floor. Reaching over to the sliding door he opened that as well.\n\nIn the light of the living room, the three police officers looked a bit embarrassed.\n\n“You live here alone?” the plainclothes man asked.\n\n“Uh, yes, I do,” Joe said, now fully awake and obviously not drunk, not ready to beat anybody up.\n\nThe three stood there for a moment, apparently unsure as to what to do next.\n\nThe uniformed officer, who had done the questioning, took out his flashlight and was shining it out into the black back yard.\n\n“You got a pretty nice garden out there,” he said in that alert tone most night shift workers have.\n\n“You’re all welcome to come back and take a better look … in the daytime,” Joe answered cheerfully.\n\nThe three looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and said “Goodnight.”\n\nIf they said they were sorry for bothering us in the middle of the night, I didn’t hear it. In fact, I was furious that Joe said “Yes” to living alone question. Who the hell was I?\n\nPerhaps Joe felt that the Salinas Police Department would not have considered me important enough to mention, perhaps he was too sleepy and didn’t think of it, perhaps he thought if he did say “Just me and my cat” they might have thought he was making fun of their mistake. At any rate, I was smarting from the insult.\n\nAfter such an interruption, Joe and I had a hard time going back to sleep.

Technology, man. Anyway, I plan on updating both guides with new info so feel free to check back regularly!\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nORIGINAL ARTICLE\n\nAs someone who has always pined for a Monster Hunter role-playing game for years, I was quite intrigued when Monster Hunter Stories was announced.\n\nGranted, not every Monster Hunter fan feels the same way (for traditionalists, make sure to check out our Monster Hunter Generations and XX Guide). As they say, however, variety is the spice of life. (For more about my thoughts on this game, check out my Monster Hunter Stories review.)\n\nSpeaking of variety, there are a lot of things for even veteran Monster Hunter players to pick up in Monster Hunter Stories. Yes, there are a lot of familiar touches for sure but this is a totally different game that’s founded on JRPG mechanics with a dash of monster collecting.\n\nFirst, let’s go over some of the basics.\n\nThe campaign\n\nYou start out as an aspiring apprentice Rider from the remote village of Hakum with your friends Lillia and Cheval. As you train to prepare for your trials and initiation, however, an ancient evil returns in the form of the Black Blight, which slowly corrupts the land and its creatures.\n\nSolving the mystery behind the dark Blight serves as the foundation of the campaign, which takes you from the sleepy village of Hakum to other towns and destinations around the world.\n\nGame flow\n\nHakum Village serves as the central hub at the beginning of the game. From here, you can branch out to do one of three activities.\n\nStory Quests: This one’s a pretty straightforward journey as well as all you need to do is follow the main Story quest markers to fill them. To give you an idea, I’ve included the Story Quests for the initial portions of the campaign that you can scroll down to in this guide. To give you an idea, I’ve included the Story Quests for the initial portions of the campaign that you can scroll down to in this guide.\n\nSubquests: These are optional missions that help you earn extra experience, money and items. Subquests can be accepted through the Mission Board in town as well as NPCs and range from finding items to slaying monsters.\n\nFree exploration: Monster Hunter Stories features several areas and locales that you can explore with your Monsties and buddy Navirou to your heart’s content. These areas feature gathering, mining and fishing points for collecting materials used in item combining as well as weapon and armor crafting. They also serve as home for a wide range of monsters that you can fight and defeat for experience and materials. Of special interest are Monster Dens, which contain Egg Nests that you can raid to find Monsties that you can hatch and call your own. Areas also include initially inaccessible portions that you can get to later on once you have a Monstie with the requisite skill or Riding Actions such as Jump or the ability to climb vines. To help travel more easily later on, you can also find umbrella stations that serve as hailing points for the Catavan, allowing to quick travel to places you’ve already been to.\n\nLater on, you will also unlock the ability to do Local or Online Battles against other players using your Monstie allies, giving you another activity to do.\n\nBattling\n\nCombat is a big part of Monster Hunter Stories, which uses turn-based battling that features its own unique twist on the classic JRPG system. With the exception of boss or story battles, you have the option of initiating combat by touching the enemy. You’ll want to approach and tag them from the butt, er, behind, if possible, in order to trigger an ambush with free hits. Conversely, you’ll want to avoid enemy contact on your behind as you can be ambushed as well.\n\nYour party typically consists of your main character and Monstie of choice. You can also switch Monsties anytime without penalty if you want to take advantage of attack typing or swap out a monster with low health. Knowing your Monsties attack preference, as well as the tendencies of enemy monsters, is important as this allows you to take advantage of the battle system’s rock-paper-scissors typing mechanic. This is especially important as you can not directly control your Monsties attacks (with the exception of certain skills or abilities) so you’ll want to be aware of what attack types they normally like to use to increase the chances of an advantageous matchup.\n\nAttack types: Attacks in Monster Hunter Stories come in three basic forms: Power, Speed and Technical. Each has a type advantage and disadvantage with another attack, which you’ll want to remember. Essentially, Speed beats Power, Power beats Technical and Technical beats Speed.\n\nVelocipreys always attack with Speed so you’ll want to counter them with a Technical attack to inflict more damage while taking less damage yourself. More advanced monsters will eventually mix up their attacks, adding a risk-reward element to fights. Yian Kut-Ku, for example, typically uses Technical attacks but likes to throw in Speed once in a while. This means that you can go for the safe play, which is to use Technical because it earns a draw with Technical and beats Speed so you’re never at a disadvantage. Otherwise, you can go for the riskier play, which is throw in Power once in a while because Yian Kut-Ku tends to use Technical more often. In fact, I’ve noticed such monsters typically have a pattern to their move swapping as well. Yian Kut-Ku, for example, seems to use a “2-1” pattern of Technical-Technical-Speed. I’ve also seen some monster alternate between doing “3-2” patterns like Power-Power-Power-Tech-Tech.\n\nNote that if your partner uses an attack with a type advantage and you use the same attack when the enemy uses an attack with a disadvantage (e.g. Power+Power vs. Technical), it will trigger a Double Attack, which does more damage and raises your Kinship Level more significantly. If you hit a foe with advantageous attacks three times, they will be Downed, leaving them helpless for a turn. A downed monster will also drop an item when hit. Keep in mind that you can be downed the same way as well.\n\nSpecial Situation: Once in a while, a special situation will arise in the midst of battle that requires you to input some QTE actions. The first you’ll likely see is a Power Clash, which requires you tap the A button rapidly to win the clash. The next is an Air Showdown, which requires you to alternately tap the L and R buttons to win. Last is the Breath Blast, which requires you to rotate the Circle Pad quickly. Win any of these and you will deal extra damage and gain Kinship meter.\n\nWeapon Combos: Each weapon has its own unique combo that triggers based on a sequence of attacks you pick for consecutive turns. Picking Power one turn, Power again next turn and Technical after that triggers a combo attack when using the Great Sword. Here is a list of combos per weapon.\n\nGreat Sword: Power-Power-Technical, Technical-Technical-Speed or Speed-Speed-Power.\n\nSword & Shield: Speed-Speed-Speed, Speed-Technical-Power or Speed-Power-Technical.\n\nHammer: Power-Power-Power, Power-Speed-Technical or Power-Technical-Speed.\n\nHunting Horn: Changes depending on weapon Melodies, which you can check in the Rider menu during battle.\n\nRide: When you fill you Kinship Gauge during battle, you will get the option to mount your Monstie. You lose access to several moves and commands like skills and item use. But your attack and defense gets buffed in exchange. Successful attacks fill out your Kinship Gauge further, with Double Attacks and Special Situation Attacks boosting the fill rate even faster. You can then trigger your Monstie’s special attack, with the effect increasing the higher the Level of your Kinship Gauge. Using this special ends your mount and separates your Rider and Monstie once again. A ride also can be ended if your life bar is depleted but the Rider will regain his or her original life bar prior to the mount.\n\nRetreat: Once in a while, enemies you fight will retreat after you beat them. This will cause their den to appear nearby, allowing you to steal their egg. Using a Paintball on a weakened monster will increase the chance for a retreat as well as certain actions (e.g. inflicting status) depending on the monster. I discuss this more in the Monstie section below.\n\nBattle Pouch: The Battle Pouch is where you put items that you want to use in battle such as Herbs, Potions and Flash Bombs. Just because you have those items in your general inventory doesn’t mean you can use the in battle so make sure to put the items you want to use in your Battle Pouch.\n\nSynergy Effects: Using skills is great and all but the drain on your Kinship gauge can make you wonder if it’s worth it sometimes. By using gear that matches your Monstie, however, you trigger a Synergy Effect, which lowers the cost to your Kinship Gauge when you give your Monstie an order.\n\nGear\n\nYou can acquire weapons and gear by buying them from the Smithy. In addition to buying gear, you also have the option of upgrading the gear you own if you want to squeeze more use out of them. Upgrading requires materials from the field, with each additional level upgrade requiring rarer materials. This is why it’s important to do Subquests with material rewards, hunt monsters in the field and also gather from the spots you see in the field as you never know when the mats might come in handy. Once you reach the Hunter city of Gildegaran, for example, you can also start doing Forge Quests in order to make new weapon or armor sets using the mats you get. These include full sets of weapons and armor that improve your synergy when fighting with the same Monstie that your set is based on (e.g. using Zamtrios gear while fighting alongside a Zamtrios).\n\nAcquiring Monsties\n\nIn order to acquire a certain type of Monstie, you will need to find its egg and hatch it. There are 11 types of eggs such as Herbivore, Fanged Beast, Bird Wyvern and Neotperon Eggs. Each egg type sports the same pattern for that type. All Bird Wyvern Eggs, for example, feature the same speckle marks while all Herbivore Eggs feature long stripe with rounded edges. Despite the pattern similarities, however, the colors can change depending on the kind of monster inside the egg. In addition to the colors, the name can have variations as well. A Humble Brd Wyv Egg, for example, has the same pattern but different colors than a Burning Brd Wyv Egg. Depending on where you find the egg, the Humble version can contain a Velocidrome while the Burning egg can contain a Yian Kut-Ku. You can also have two similarly named eggs that contain a different variant based on color. A Burning Brd Wyv Egg with a Purple or Yellow shell with Blue speckles, for instance, could hatch a normal Yian Kut-Ku. A Burning Brd Wyv Egg with a green shell and yellow or blue spots, however, might contain a Blue Yian Kut-Ku variant.\n\nMonstie Eggs can be found at Egg Nests located inside Monster Dens that randomly pop up in the field. Note that you can swap the egg you find a few times before you run out in case you don’t get the shell pattern, weight or smell you want at first (pay attention to Navirou's comments about weight and smell as heavier and nicer smelling eggs will have more Bingo slots and better genes respectively). In addition to regular Monster Dens, you will run into Rare Monster Dens, which are denoted by a Golden Cave. These give you a chance to acquire higher-quality Monsties with better genes. Monster Den locations also reset when you enter a town or dungeon. Some monsters retreat to their dens after you beat them, allowing you nab their egg. Later on, you'll also get the recipe for making Paintballs. The item can be used to make low-health hatchable monsters retreat if thrown three times before they faint, allowing you to find their dens. This strategy is great when combined with a Qurupeco, which allows you to call a monster in the field to battle. You can start hatching a Qurupeco once you reach Monsonne Plains near Gildegaran.\n\nInitially, you can only command Rarity 1 Monsties like Aptonoth and Velocidrome. As you progress through the campaign and increase your Rider rank, however, you can command higher level Monsties.\n\nBelow is a list of all the Monsties you can acquire on the game. I’ve included not just the location of their eggs but where you can normally find them monster themselves in case you want to fight them for a chance to make them retreat to their den. For the latter, I include paintball probabilities as well as other things you can do to raise your chances to trigger a retreat for a particular monster. Note that higher rarity monsters won’t show up in certain areas until High Rank and/or after you finish certain subquests. I added methods to make some of them pop up but not all. When in doubt, just clear your Quest Board and NPC requests as they come and all of these Monsties should show up as you get farther into the story (or, in the case of some monsters, clear it).\n\nApceros\n\nMonster Habitat: Monsonne Plains\n\nEgg Nest Location: Perennial Pass, Trese Desert\n\nRetreat Probability: Paintball (High).

Defeat while blinded (Slight).\n\nRite of Channeling\n\nOnce you reach Darj Snowfield, you will eventually learn how to do the Rite of Channeling. This allows you to transfer genes from one Monstie to another, at the cost of releasing the monster that served as the gene source back into the wild. Gene transfers allow you to unlock hidden skills and also teach Monsties moves that they normally don’t learn. By channeling the genes of a Yian Kut-Ku, for example, you can make a Lagombi learn the Fireball skill.\n\nFilling a straight line of slots with skills of the same color or pattern will also awaken secret skills. Here’s a sampling of “Bingo” bonuses you can unlock depending on what straight-line combinations you fill the slots with.\n\nFire Bingo: Fire Damage Up with straight line of Fire genes.\n\nFire Damage Up with straight line of Fire genes. Water Bingo: Water Damage Up with straight line of Water genes.\n\nWater Damage Up with straight line of Water genes. Thunder Bingo: Thunder Damage Up with straight line of Thunder genes.\n\nThunder Damage Up with straight line of Thunder genes. Ice Bingo: Ice Damage Up with straight line of Ice genes.\n\nIce Damage Up with straight line of Ice genes. Dragon Bingo: Dragon Damage Up with straight line of Dragon genes.\n\nDragon Damage Up with straight line of Dragon genes. Power Bingo: Power Attack Damage Up with straight line of Power genes.\n\nPower Attack Damage Up with straight line of Power genes. Speed Bingo: Speed Attack Damage Up with straight line of Speed genes.\n\nSpeed Attack Damage Up with straight line of Speed genes. Technical Bingo: Technical Attack Damage Up with straight line of Technical genes.\n\nTechnical Attack Damage Up with straight line of Technical genes. Anything Bingo: Max HP Up when completing a line with any gene combination.\n\nMax HP Up when completing a line with any gene combination. Non-Elem Bingo: Speed Up when completing a line with non-elemental genes.\n\nRite of Channeling is good for min-maxers or finding use for duplicate Monsties that are clogging up your stable. It also encourages you to raid those random Monster Dens and catch more monsters due to the randomness of Monstie gene slots and traits.\n\nLater on, you can also acquire Beads, which are channeling gems that grants different skills such as attack boosts and resistances. You can also acquire different H. Crystals for creating channelling gems. For even more Monstie perfection, you can find stims for unlocking gene slots, which is especially ideal for competitive players who want to further fine tune their monsters post-game.\n\nExpedition Parties\n\nOnce you reach Albarax, you will have the option to start sending your Monsties to Expedition Parties. You basically pick 5 Monsties to send out per expedition, giving them the opportunity to gather items, as well as experience. You can even whether you want them to get fewer or more items, which shortens or lengthens the time they are away. You can also instruct them to focus on gaining experience or concentrate on specific item types such as plants, mushrooms, ore, berries, fish, bugs, bones or treasure. This is a great way for squeezing in some extra gathering or leveling up Monsties that you don’t have in your battle party. The timer also keeps running even when your 3DS is in sleep mode so you can keep sending Monsties out even when you’re not playing, then check back every 20 or so minutes.\n\nRecipe Books\n\nYou can acquire books during the course of the game that contain recipes for items such as Potions, Mega Potions, Antidotes and Large Barrel Bombs. These are important as buying that stuff from the store will make you go broke in no time. The bulk of recipes are earned by completing certain Subquests.

Can’t remember how I got this so it might be a story-based reward.\n\nCool and Healthy: Acquired by answering all 3 questions of the Felyne in Albarax who’s holding the Purrplexing Puzzles quiz.\n\nPoogies\n\nOink! Little piggies and Monster Hunter are a long-standing match. That has not changed with Monster Hunter Stories, which has 100 Lost Poogies for you to find.

Gives Ancient Potion.\n\nShady (068): This not-so-slim Shady with green tiger stripes is at Wintertide Tunnel.

Gives you Frozen Mushroom.\n\nWalkthrough\n\nHere’s a quick walkthrough of Story Quests from the game to help get you started. The walkthrough currently covers the events from Pondry Hill to Dovan Volcano. A list of monsters and their locations is included after the walkthrough.\n\nPONDRY HILL TO WHISTILL FOREST\n\n1 Year Later: A year has passed since the Nargacuga’s attack. Hakum Village is slowly rebuilding back to its former glory. Today is the day of the Rite of Kinship! It’s the final step to becoming a Rider, but what will you do? Head to the back of Hakum Village toward the Room of Trials.\n\nA Rider’s Trial: You have obtained a Monstie, but the Rite of Kinship is far from over! Now you must head to the Mt. Pondry Caves and immerse the Kinship Stone given to you by Chief Omna in the water there. But what could be waiting in the caves…? The cave is located on the western side of Pondry Hills. For the boss fight, make sure to check the monster list below for some quick strategies. You can now include Rarity 2 Monsties in your party.\n\nAll in One Basket: You have overcome the trials and become a Rider. Your first task, given by Dan, is to find a monster egg and bring it back to the village. Hatching eggs will get you new Monsties! Get on your Monstie and head to Pondry Hills. Just follow the marker to get to your first Monster Den. Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Aptonoth, Velocidrome, Yian Kut-ku, Blue Yian Kut-Ku and Arzuros.\n\nMy First Combo: Your Rider training has only just begun! Today’s lesson: Combining for Beginners! Select Combine from the Camp Menu and make 5 Potions! Potions are made from Herbs and Blue Mushrooms. If you don’t have enough, go find more in Pondry Hills. Use your Aptonoth’s Plant Search field skill to more easily find them.\n\nChasing the Blue Bear: You have finally been entrusted with an important mission from Chief Omna! The location: Whistill Forest. You are excited about your first expedition, to confront an angry Arzuros known as The Glutton. Steel yourself and set out on your mission! Check out the Arzuros data at the Monster list below for its tendencies.\n\nCheval and Lilia: Cheval, his hatred of Black Blight deepening, has run away from Hakum Village. Lilia chased him, heading into Whistill Forest, where the Blackgrass was found! You must go after them quickly! Check the monster list below for the Iodrome’s tendencies.\n\nYian Kut-Who? You have passed Dan’s first test… Today’s training is slightly different: You will be investigating a Yian Kut-Ku! Head to the Old Mine in the rocky section of Pondry Hills!\n\nACatavan Quandary: A Catavaner is in trouble at the Old Mine: A Yian Kut-Ku has stolen part of his cart! The sly bird, known as The Veteran, waits on the other side of the lake. Do whatever you can to fix the cart!\n\nThe Forbidden Land: The Black Blight continues its inexorable advance. Now is the time for action! If you sneak away from Chief Omna and head to the Forbidden Land before Dan, youl’ll be able to solve the problem and prove yourself a true Rider! Check the monster list below once again for battle strategies against a familiar foe. You can now include Rarity 3 Monsties in your party.\n\nDARJ SNOWFIELDS TO WINTERTIDE TUNNEL\n\nThe Mountain Hermit: While on the way to Gildegaran, you reach the White Plains of Darj Snowfields. Chief Omna told you of a Wyverian who knows the secrets to the Rite of Channeling living here. All you know is that he is “a young handsome man.” Where could he be? Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Popo, Bulldrome, Lagombi, Zamtrios, Khezu and Red Khezu.\n\nThe Mysterious Rider: As you enter the Wintertide Tunnel, you find a girl collapsed there. Enveloped by her Barioth, she remains unconscious. You can’t leave her like this, so you decide to head to the nearby cabins.\n\nA Barioth Leads the Way: On leaving Wintertide Tunnel, the girl’s Barioth is waiting! It seems to be telling you to follow it. Perhaps if you follow the Barioth, it will lead you to the cabins.\n\nAvinia’s Test: The Rider, who introduces herself as Avinia, claims to be from a different village. To prove to her that you are a rider, you must collect Mountain Herbs. It seems they are found in precarious places that can be only reached while riding.\n\nThe Darj Rock Baths: The Riddlemaster appears suddenly. He says if you can bring him Hot Spring Dumplings, he will let you stay in the cabins! You set out to the Darj Rock Baths to find some. Maybe there will be a way to heal Avinia’s wounds, too.\n\nA Monstrous Riddle: The riddle reads “My fur is white like snow, my ears long as icicles.” You vaguely remember a white monster matching that description… It was somewhere around the lake… What was is called? La… La… La-something.\n\nThrough Wintertide Tunnel: Now that your Monstie has been powered up by the Rite of Channeling, it’s time to move to Gildegaran! But beware, The Khezu that attacked Avinia lurks in Wintertide Tunnel.\n\nGILDEGARAN\n\nArrival in Gildegaran! You’ve finally reached Gildegaran, but the townspeople seem afraid of your Monsties! You have to ease their minds somehow… For now, you decide to follow Navirou’s advice and go to the Hunter’s Guild to introduce yourself to the Guildmaster! There are a couple of Lost Poogies in this building so make sure not to miss them. Monsties you can start hatching in this region include Apceros, Gypceros, Gendrome, Royal Ludroth, Cephadrome, Qurupeco, Nerscylla, Barroth and the Queen of the Skies, Rathian.\n\nMajek’s Request: The Guildmaster, Majek (The Gathering), has asked you to go out and slay a Royal Ludroth that has appeared on the coast of Monsonne Plains. Go and deal with it, and report to Majek when you’re finished. Royal Ludroth likes to start with Water Soak then use Power and Technical attacks.\n\nTotally Rad ‘Shroom Hunt: You accepted a challenging request from Reverto, or so you thought. Collecting mushrooms in the Babda Rainforest… It doesn’t sound too difficult, butmybe there’s some kind of hidden plan at work here… Get ready to fight a Nerscylla, which likes to use Technical and Power Attacks. It also likes to use a Sealing attack that prevents you from using one of your moves.\n\nScrivener’s Request: Captain Simone of the Royal Scriveners has asked you to help with a royal pain, er, monster survey. A Qurupeco has been sighted acting strangely in the Monsonne Plains. You decide to check it out. As Monster Hunter pros know, the Qurupeco in itself is not a problem. Instead, it’s the monster that it calls in that’s the real pain. In this case, the cheeky bird not only decides to call in a Rathian, it actually calls one that is blighted to boot (this guy…). I recommend taking out the Qurupeco first, which should be pretty easy. It likes to spam Technical attacks then throw in Speed. If you’re quick, maybe you can take it out before it buffs the Rathian (ungh). The Rathian will have two targets, by the way, which is its head and main body. To make the fight easy, bring in a Red Khezu as its lightning attacks do massive damage on the Rahian. Its Kinship Attack also hits multiple targets allowing you to kill two birds (or maybe a bird and dragon) with one stone. You can also equip Blue Kut-Ku armor and the Khezu Shock Sword to do extra damage and laugh off fire attacks. Rathian likes to use Speed Attacks, by the way, then occasionally throws in Power.\n\nOASUM TO ALBARAX\n\nTo Oasum: The Black Fiend has been sighted in Revero’s hometown, Albarax. It may be connected to the Black Blight! First you musts head to Oasum, where Hunters are assembling to plot their next move. Monsters that you can run into here include Daimyo Hermitaur, Barroth and Diablos.\n\nQuicksand Search: A whirlpool of quicksand stands between you and the village of Albarax. Large monsters must have caused this! Find the 3 monsters that hide underground: Barroth, Daimyo Hermitaur and Cephadrome, and get rid of them. You’ll need to go to opposing ends of the map here so make sure to find those Catavan points to make your trip easier. Daimyo Hermitaur is susceptible to Fire and Lightning and tends to use Technical attacks as well as Power. Watch out when it assumes a blocking position as it will usually counter when attacked from this stance. Barroth likes to use Speed and Power. It is also weak against Fire attacks.\n\nThe Blighted Cephadrome: The source of the quicksand was the Cephadrome! A mysterious scientist appeared with some kind of mecha-monster and a strange mood descended… The Black Blight still needs to be purified! Prepare yourself and head for the quicksand! Cephadrome likes to use Power Attacks and is weak against Ice. A Speed-loving Lagombi would be perfect against it. You can also use a Zamtrios (which is what I did as my Lagombi was underleveled) but make sure to order the guy to use a skill if it starts using Technical attacks while Cephadrome is about to do a head-to-head attack. Bring Sonic Bombs, by the way, to fish it out when it digs.\n\nThe Black Fiend: You made it through to Albarax! There, the Black Fiend, a blighted Diablos lies in wait. It will not be an ordinary fight, but you must show everyone your true power as a Rider. This guy will probably be the first legitimate challenge you face as far as bosses go. Fortunately, the right preparation will ensure you take it down on your first try. My main tip for this battle is to make sure your health is topped off, especially when it gets enraged. Diablos does its Fierce Stab move twice on the same turn when mad, which can KO targets that are not in full health. It also likes to use Power and Technical and is weak to Ice attacks. I ended up using my Zamtrios here since it was at a higher level than my Lagombi, as well as Zamtrios armor and the Zamtrios hammer. If using Zamtrios, order it to use Ice Armor on the first turn or if it wants to use a Technical Attack and you have a feeling Diablos will use Power. Besides the extra defense, the armor also imbues Ice into Zamtrios’ regular attacks, too. His Spread Frost Breath and Kinship Attack hits all of Diablos’ parts, too, making it easier to take down the head and tail. Lastly, bring Sonic Bombs to stun it when it digs underground. (After this battle, you can start adding Rarity 4 Monsties to your party. Tigrex and its eggs will also start showing up in Darj Snowfields.)\n\nBring the Water Back: Finally, peace has returned to Albarax. But the village is still in ruins. Maybe breaking the rock holding back the spring will restore the village… Do you have a monster with the Rock Breaker ability, like the Yian Kut-Ku or Lagombi?\n\nRebuilding: Albarax is nearly restored to its former glory. Now, you must gather the Grand Felvine using your Monstie Expedition Party at the Stables. Grand Felvine should convince the Felynes to help!\n\nGEO-FULKRIGHT & DOVAN VOLCANO\n\nA New Rider: According to Lilia, another Rider was seen in Gildegaran. Could it be Cheval? Or maybe Avinia? Lilia seems concerned, so you should search for that Rider…\n\nInto the Volcano! Ratha, the monster you forged a bond so long ago, is alive! Ride the grown-up Ratha and fly to the Dovan Volcano. According to Simone, Dr. Manelger is there! Head for the village in the volcano, Geo-Fulkright!\n\nOdd Rock, Odder Felyne: The entrance to Dovan Mines is blocked by a large rock. You should be able to enter via the Mine Path on the clifftop. But how does Navirou know the way when he claims to have never been here before? Something is strange…\n\nChase the Assistant! In the mines, you ran into Manelger’s assistant! Just as Captain Simone said, the Doctor’s hideout should be just through here, so chase the assistant.\n\nBig Barrel Bombs: Dr. Manelger was here after all! And the rock that was blocking the way… Wait, it moved?! Now that the route is open, you are able to meet up with Dommel and the others. If you bring him some Flame Rocks, he will destroy the rock with a Big Barrel Bomb UG!\n\nEscape from the Lava Cave! The large rock was actually a modified Uragaan! Manelger and his assistant ran away toward Dovan Volcano! Navirou is acting strangely again, but now you must slip through the lava and give chase! The main thing you need to do here is bring something to counter the heat like Cool Mist, for example (don’t forget to put it your Battle Pouch). Otherwise, it’s gonna be a long day as your actions get cancelled by overeating. The Uragaan is strong against fire but incredible weak against water. He also has a head part that lets him use an electric attack if you don’t break it. I was using a Red Khezu, however, and the monster is good at resisting the lightning attack (Khezu’s tendency to use Technical attacks, however, is a disadvantage against Uragaan’s Power attacks). For regular attacks, Uragaan tends to use Power most and then Technical attacks. He also likes to set a Powder Stone on the field that will damage you if you don’t destroy it beforehand. When enraged, Uragaan uses Power 70 percent of the time compared to Technical at 30 percent of the time when using a normal attack. For special attacks, it tends to use the tail swipe 70 percent of the time and its megaton stomp 30 percent of the time while enraged.\n\nSubquests\n\nThis being a Monster Hunter game, there are a variety of quests and subquests for you to partake in.

You might want to solve today's puzzle before reading further! Get Moving! (Freestyle)\n\nConstructor: Claire Rimkus\n\nEditor: Amanda Rafkin\n\nWhat I Learned from Today’s Puzzle\n\nTREAT (43A: Little ___ culture (form of self-care that involves rewards)) Although the term \"little TREAT culture\" is new to me, the practice isn't. I'm a firm believer in treating myself! Little TREAT culture is exactly what it sounds like, indulging in a small TREAT (maybe a coffee drink, a walk to a park, or solving a crossword) as a reward (perhaps for running errands, completing a work assignment, or paying bills). The term \"little TREAT culture\" emerged on TikTok, where there are many videos encouraging folks to TREAT themselves. If used correctly, little TREATs can provide a mental boost and play a role in self-care; it's science.\n\nRandom Thoughts & Interesting Things\n\nMALE (15A: Like bright-red cardinals) As is the case with several bird species, MALE and female cardinals have different coloring. MALE cardinals are bright red, while female cardinals are a light brown with a reddish tint on the wings, crest, and tail feathers. Young cardinals have a coloring similar to female cardinals, regardless of their sex. A MALE cardinal only acquires the characteristic red coloring after it molts and grows adult feathers.\n\nGYMNASTICS (18A: Simone Biles' sport) During the Summer Olympics in Paris that are happening now, there has been a lot of news about Simone Biles doing GYMNASTICS. Simone Biles will be coming home from Paris with three gold medals and one silver medal. That brings her total number of Olympic medals to 11. Simone Biles has also won 30 World Championship medals. She is the most decorated athlete in the history of GYMNASTICS.\n\nWAGS (22A: Swishes back and forth, like a tail) My cat, Willow, has an extremely fluffy tail, and when she WAGS it, she doesn't always pay attention to where it's going. She's been known to sweep things off the table with her tail, and occasionally I've gotten a face full of tail.\n\nTIP (26A: \"Ugh, it's right on the ___ of my tongue!\") The older I get, the more words seem to get stuck right on the TIP of my tongue!\n\nOSLO (34A: Norway's capital) In addition to being its capital, OSLO is the most populous city in Norway. OSLO is located at the northernmost end of Oslofjord, one of the many fjords that make up Norway's coast.\n\nSOY (40A: Tamari ingredient) Tamari is a Japanese sauce made from fermented soybeans. It is similar to SOY sauce, but slightly thicker (and gluten-free)\n\nCBS (52A: \"The Equalizer\" TV network) The Equalizer is a crime drama TV series that premiered on CBS in 2021. The show is a reboot of a series of the same name that aired on CBS from 1985-1989). In the reboot, Queen Latifah stars as the title character, a former CIA operative acting as a vigilante to help those with the odds stacked against them to obtain justice. The fifth season of The Equalizer is scheduled to air later this year.\n\nARTS (56A: The \"A\" in STEAM) In education, the acronym STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, ARTS, and mathematics. STEAM programs incorporate skills associated with the ARTS – such as design and creative thinking – into the teaching of STEM skills.\n\nWASP (58A: Ant-Man's partner) Ant-Man and WASP are Marvel Comics characters. In the Marvel movies Ant-Man and the WASP (2018), and Ant-Man and the WASP: Quantumania (2023), the characters are played by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly respectively. Ant-Man and WASP both have suits that allow them to shrink or grow in scale while increasing in strength.\n\nTODAY (68A: Day before tomorrow) I thoroughly enjoyed this clue! I had to think about it a moment, and then, \"Aha!\"\n\nSVEN (70A: Reindeer in \"Frozen\") In the Disney animated movies Frozen (2013) and Frozen II (2019), SVEN is Kristoff's reindeer companion. (Kristoff is an iceman living in the mountains.) During the making of Frozen, Disney brought a live reindeer into the studio so animators could study its movements. They learned that reindeer scratch their heads with their hind legs, similar to dogs. Although SVEN is not a talking animal, Kristoff sometimes \"talks\" for him, voicing what SVEN might be thinking. Jonathan Groff who voices Kristoff, also provides SVEN's voice for those moments.\n\nGINA (3D: \"Suits\" actress Torres) GINA Torres played the role of Jessica Lourdes Pearson in the legal drama, Suits (2011-2019). She reprised the role in the spin-off TV series, Pearson, that aired in 2019 for one season. Currently, GINA Torres is playing the role of Emergency Medical Services Captain Tommy Vega on the TV series, 9-1-1: Lone Star.\n\nALMA (7D: \"___ and How She Got Her Name\" (children's book)) ALMA and How She Got Her Name is a picture book by Juana Martinez Neal. It is about a young girl named ALMA Sofia Esperanza José Pura Candela. She thinks she has too many names, until her father tells her the story of each of her names. Fun fact: We have previously seen this book title used to clue the words GOT, HER, and NAME.\n\nASIA (19A: Angkor Wat's continent) Angkor Wat, located in Cambodia, is a complex that was originally constructed as a Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire in the early 12th century. It was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the century. Angkor Wat is spread across 400 acres, and the Guinness World Records considers it the world's largest religious structure. Although it is no longer used as a temple, Angkor Wat attracts numerous visitors, and is still considered by many to be a spiritual place. This is the first appearance of our crossword-friend ASIA this month.\n\nPIE (27D: Dessert eaten on Pi Day) I'm always happy to see mentions of Pi Day and PIE in the grid.\n\nSLEEP STUDY (31D: Procedure that can diagnose apnea) SLEEP apnea is a condition where a person's breathing temporarily stops more often than normal (defined as more than five times per hour) while they are sleeping. As you might imagine, SLEEP apnea disrupts normal SLEEP. A SLEEP STUDY, which records bodily activity during SLEEP can diagnose SLEEP apnea, as well as other conditions such as SLEEP-related movement disorders, seizure disorders, or grinding of the teeth.\n\nIAGO (37D: \"Aladdin\" parrot) In the Disney animated movie Aladdin (1992), IAGO is a talking parrot voiced by Gilbert Gottfried. IAGO is the sidekick of Jafar, the movie's villain. In the sequels and TV series in the Aladdin franchise, IAGO is reformed into a better character. IAGO is named for the Shakespeare villain in Othello.\n\nSNAP (57D: Provide validation at a slam poetry event) As I've mentioned previously, a SNAP is used as a way to show appreciation at poetry slams, as SNAPs are less likely to distract the performer.\n\nCrossword Puzzle Theme Synopsis\n\nGET MOVING! (Freestyle): The word freestyle in the puzzle lets us know there's no theme today. The title could be a nod to MUSICAL CHAIRS (29A: Game where you sit when the tunes shut off). It could also be a nod to GYMNASTICS, as that is a sport that certainly requires one to GET MOVING!\n\nSince I learned the term \"little TREAT culture\" today, it's appropriate that this puzzle was a TREAT to solve. In addition to the answers I've already highlighted, I enjoyed the ADDITIONAL answers PLAYING IT COOL, SOUNDS GOOD, THINGS TO DO, and YOGA POSE.

And like Serena Williams and the U.S. women’s soccer team, she sees no reason to shy away from it.\n\nThat confidence, and her willingness to own all of her emotions, is what she hopes will be her legacy, every bit as much as what she’s done on the floor.\n\n“It’s important to teach our female youth that it’s OK to say, 'Yes, I am good at this,' and you don’t hold back,” Biles said Friday in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY Sports the day after winning her fifth all-around title at the world championships. “You only see the men doing it. And they’re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it’s good (to do) because once you realize you’re confident and good at it, then you’re even better at what you do.\n\n“It’s not out of cockiness,” she added. “I’ve won five world titles and if I say, 'I’m the best gymnast there is,' (the reaction is) 'Oh, she’s cocky. Look at her now.’ No, the facts are literally on the paper. I think it’s important to teach (young girls) that.”\n\nWilliams was one of Biles’ favorite athletes growing up, not only for her dominance but for her willingness to speak out and show emotion. As Biles has gotten older – she’ll be 23 in March – she has been increasingly willing to use the platform that her place in the sport affords her.\n\nShe has been a leader in talking about the sexual assault scandal in her sport. USA Gymnastics only stopped holding national team training camps at the Karolyi ranch after Biles announced she didn't want to go back there, saying for the first time that she, too, had been abused by Larry Nassar.\n\nHer pointed criticism of federation CEO Kerry Perry’s ineptitude, and interim leader Mary Bono’s tone-deafness, hastened both of their departures.\n\nShe has continued to hold both USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee accountable for their failings.\n\nShe’s also been honest about her emotions, the highs and the lows. She ran off the podium laughing and sticking out her tongue after a great uneven bars routine at the national championships in August, and did a mic drop after wrapping up her fifth world title on floor Thursday night.\n\nQ&A: Simone Biles on where she keeps all those medals, her favorite athletes, her future\n\nROCKY RELATIONSHIP: Why Simone Biles has a 'love-hate' relationship with the balance beam\n\nShe talked of being so nervous she wanted to vomit before team finals, and made no secret of her displeasure with herself after falling the first time she tried her triple-twisting, double somersault pass on floor exercise in competition.\n\n“I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older that it’s OK to show real, raw emotion,” Biles said. “You don’t have to be a robot all the time, and you don’t always have to seem happy out there.”\n\nAsked if she realizes the impact that can have, for youngsters in particular to see someone at the top of her game struggling with the same emotions they do, Biles said she does.\n\nThat’s why she is willing to do it.\n\n“It also shows kids that it’s OK, if you’re enjoying the moment, to smile, to be happy. If you’re not having a good time, it’s OK, you don’t have to hide that from people,” she said. “Not saying you should scream or punch things. You could probably do that behind the scenes. But if you’re upset, you can show that you’re upset.”\n\nManaging her emotions is sure to take on greater importance in the month's leading up next year's Tokyo Olympics. Someone has to fill the void left by the retirements of Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt, and no athlete has more star power than Biles. Expect to see her everywhere in the lead-up to the Game, and hear about all the medals she will win.\n\n“I try to stay focused on myself and the expectations I have for myself going in. But at times it’s overwhelming,” Biles said, pausing. “I don’t know. Somehow I just manage it.”\n\nThis isn’t the position Biles expected to be in when she came back after taking off the year after the Rio Olympics.\n\nShe couldn’t imagine being able to top 2016, when she left the Games with five medals, four of them gold. She’d won the world title the three years prior to that, the first woman to win three in a row. And she had a winning streak of three-plus years, an unheard of run of consistency and dominance in a sport often decided by tenths and hundredths of a point.\n\nYet she has not only topped what she did the last quadrennium, she’s surpassed her former self.\n\nShe won her fifth world title by 2.1 points, her largest margin of victory yet at the world championships. Her 22 medals at worlds is only one less than the record by Belarus’ Vitaly Scherbo, and she’ll blow by that this weekend, having qualified for all four event finals.\n\nOh, she’s also had three new skills named for her in the past year, one each on floor exercise, vault and balance beam.\n\n“Coming back, I was really nervous if I could top my 2016 performances,” Biles said. “Once we started training and putting more skills in, and we competed for the first time, I was like 'Wow, I think I am better than 2016.’ That’s what blew my mind. Just looking at the differences in the videos.\n\n“Even with my form,” she added. “It’s a little bit cleaner, too, on some of the things because we’ve paid attention to detail there.”\n\nLike Williams, like the U.S. women’s soccer team, Biles is simply in a class by herself.\n\nShe was gifted with natural athletic ability, yes. But her technique is flawless, which allows her to do the skills that set her apart – far apart – from everyone else.\n\nHer triple-double in the team final was so huge, fans several rows up had to look up to watch it. That meant she was probably 9 feet in the air. Yet she stuck her landing, her feet not moving an inch.\n\nHer double-twisting, double somersault dismount on balance beam, considered by the International Gymnastics Federation to be so difficult that it watered down its value so other gymnasts wouldn’t try it, is done with more ease than normal people would do a cartwheel.\n\nBiles appreciates the magnitude of what she’s doing, because there are times she herself can’t believe it, either.\n\n“I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I'm going crazy,” she said Thursday night. “I really don't know how I do it sometimes.”\n\nBecause she’s the best gymnast there is. And she’s not afraid to own it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2023/01/03/detroit-lions-chuck-hughes-died-field-50-years-ago/10982981002/", "title": "Inside tragic day Detroit Lions' Chuck Hughes died on field", "text": "Bill Dow\n\nSpecial to Detroit Free Press\n\nOn a gloomy, damp afternoon more than 50 years ago, 54,418 excited football fans made their pilgrimage to Tiger Stadium to see if the Detroit Lions, sporting a four-game winning streak and tied for first place with Minnesota in the NFC Central Division, could defeat the \"Monsters of the Midway\" led by Chicago’s Dick Butkus.\n\nLocal radio listeners — the regional telecast was blacked out in Detroit — were glued to the play-by-play of Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds on WJR-AM (760).\n\nWith the Lions in a two-minute drill and trailing, 28-23, little-used Chuck Hughes, who entered the game in the fourth quarter replacing the injured Larry Walton, made a 32-yard catch from quarterback Greg Landry for a first down on the Bears’ 37-yard line.\n\nHowever, by 3:30 p.m. Oct. 24, 1971, the game’s outcome seemed meaningless. The tragedy that occurred with a minute left to play would forever serve as a glaring reminder of life’s fragility.\n\nIt is believed Hughes is the only player from the NFL who died while competing in a game.\n\n4TH AND MONDAY: Sign up to get the latest NFL news and stories sent to your inbox\n\nWho was Chuck Hughes?\n\nAlthough a walk-on at Texas Western (later the University of Texas-El Paso), Hughes finished his college career with the second-most receiving yards and the third-highest number of receptions in NCAA history. He was the 1967 fourth-round draft choice of the Eagles and played sparingly in his three seasons with Philadelphia.\n\nThe reserve receiver was acquired ahead of the 1970 season, when he made a remarkable 42-yard catch that helped seal the victory over the Oakland Raiders in the Thanksgiving Day game.\n\n\"Chuck didn’t have great speed but he was a good player, a great guy and teammate, and he worked like hell at practice,\" former Lions head coach and Hall of Famer Joe Schmidt said earlier this month. \"He would follow me up and down the sidelines asking to get in the game but Chuck never complained.\"\n\nAdded Landry:\n\n“Chuck ran great routes and had great hands, but what we all remember most about him was the quality of the person and how well-liked he was by everyone. He was always upbeat and never down and was someone you always wanted to associate with.\"\n\nA sudden tragedy\n\nAfter Hughes’ first-down catch, Landry threw the ball out of bounds to stop the clock, and then appeared to connect with end Charlie Sanders — until the tight end was slammed to the ground by Butkus just as the ball arrived.\n\nWith 1:02 showing on the game clock, the 28-year-old Hughes began running back to the huddle when suddenly he grabbed his chest. He dropped face down onto the turf at the 25-yard line.\n\nBears defensive end Ed O’Bradovich will never forget what he witnessed that day.\n\n\"After the play, I turned around and I saw Chuck fall to the ground about 12 yards away and when he was laying there his eyes were wide open,\" O’Bradovich, now 81, said from his home in Illinois. \"The Lions were out of timeouts and I was thinking he was trying to get an injury timeout so I started yelling at him, 'You no-good so-and-so, and I screamed at the referee that he was faking it. But then I saw Butkus bend over and start waving to the Detroit bench for medical help and I thought, 'Oh (expletive), what can this be.'\"\n\nLions center Ed Flanagan saw Butkus waving his arms while standing near Hughes.\n\n\"When I first saw Butkus standing over him I first thought, 'Oh God, don’t tell me Dick hit Chuck,' but as we learned no one had hit him on that play,\" Flanagan said recently.\n\nFormer Detroit radio and television personality Tom Ryan was sitting with his wife Joan in the upper deck at the opposite end, behind the south end zone.\n\n\"We didn't have a portable radio or binoculars with us and we assumed Hughes had been knocked unconscious, but then it progressively looked more serious with the medical personnel out there for so long and with the crowd becoming eerily so silent,\" Ryan said.\n\nLions team physicians Richard Thompson, Edwin Guise, trainer Kent Falb and assistant trainer Gary Tuthill rushed onto the field. After carefully removing the receiver’s helmet Guise began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Hughes as Thompson began rhythmic thumping on Hughes' chest.\n\n\"When I got to Chuck, it was an athlete trainer’s worst nightmare because he was not breathing and was extremely pale,\" said Falb, who ran to the concourse area under the stands near the Tigers' bullpen to notify the awaiting ambulance personnel. They came out with a gurney to transport Hughes to Henry Ford Hospital, 3 miles north of the ballpark.\n\n'Someone doesn't just drop'\n\nAs the minutes ticked, which many witnesses thought felt like an eternity, a man ran out with an oxygen tank while anesthesiologist Eugene Boyle ran down from the upper deck stands and onto the field to assist the Lions doctors.\n\nMeanwhile, on the radio broadcast, Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds in very somber tones tried to fill the time as best they could. Patrick kept saying, 'This doesn’t look good, this doesn’t look good at all.'\n\nHughes' wife Sharon was sitting in the west upper deck stands with the other player wives.\n\n\"Normally after a play, I would be talking with my friend Dru Robb (wife of defensive end Joe Robb) but for some reason after the play ended, I was focused on Chuck and saw him grab his chest and fall down,\" Hughes said last week from her home in San Antonio. \"I knew right away it was serious because someone doesn’t just drop in mid-stride when you haven’t been hit. I thought maybe he had choked on his mouthpiece. Dru and I immediately ran down and although they would not let us on the field, we waited next to the ambulance.\"\n\nAs the medical personnel ran Hughes off the field on the gurney, the fans were standing and not a sound could be heard. The receiver, one of 14 children raised in meager circumstance in west Texas, never regained consciousness.\n\n\"I knew something horrible had happened because when they were rolling Chuck off the field one of his arms fell down and his hand was flopping around back and forth, and I thought to myself, 'Holy Christ, I think he’s dead,'\" said O’Bradovich.\n\nFalb said his wife remembered it was \"so quiet in the stadium that the only thing you could hear was the fading sound of the ambulance siren until it finally made it to Henry Ford Hospital.”\n\nHughes had jumped into the ambulance and accompanied her husband to the hospital.\n\n\"Kent Falb worked continually on Chuck giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and I don’t know how he kept on and on but he did,\" said Hughes, who began dating Chuck when the couple attended Texas Western.\n\nNone of the players at that point cared about the game, and when play resumed with 62 seconds left, the Bears ran out the clock with their 28-23 victory after Landry threw an incomplete pass to Altie Taylor.\n\n\"When we got into the locker room, we all got down on one knee and prayed for Chuck,\" O'Bradovich said.\n\nWith the media banned from entering the Lions locker room, head coach Joe Schmidt had gathered his players, many of whom were sitting in front of their lockers, still in their uniforms and openly weeping.\n\n\"I was so confused and upset that I really didn’t know how to handle it, but I did my best to speak with the team and asked everyone to pray for Chuck before I went to the hospital,\" Schmidt said.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAfter the game, a distraught Thompson, told reporters, \"His heart stopped on the field. We thought we got it going one time but couldn’t be sure. It stopped again.\"\n\nAt 4:41 p.m., Charles Frederick Hughes was pronounced dead. He was 28.\n\n“I know that the doctors and Kent Falb tried their very best to save Chuck,” says Sharon Hughes.\n\nDetroit Free Press sports editor Joe Falls wrote the next day that as team owner William Clay Ford was choking back tears he said: \"Never, ever in the wildest moments would you ever believe a thing like this could happen. It’s just inconceivable. Our whole team is filled with a great sense of sorrow. Chuck was a great player and a great person.\"\n\nThe following day the autopsy report revealed Hughes had died from an undiagnosed and advanced \"arteriosclerotic coronary heart disease with acute coronary thrombotic occlusion\" or as otherwise described by Thompson: \"He had a hardening of the main artery supplying blood to the heart and a clot had formed in this artery shutting off the flow of a blood.\"\n\nThe report also mentioned that there was old scarring on the posterior wall of the heart indicating evidence of previous heart trauma.\n\nGuise told reporters, \"One dies officially when one is pronounced dead, but in my heart, I feel Chuck died on the field.\"\n\nTo this day, Falb agrees.\n\n\"We did everything we could based upon the skills and everything we knew at the time. You could have had the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic on the field that day but he was not going to survive. He was dead,\" says Falb.\n\n'Rare and unusual'\n\nWhen speaking to reporters upon the release of the autopsy report, Guise said: \"The degenerative disease was coming on for years, and there’s no way to detect this. I’ve been talking to cardiologists all over the place and no one has devised a test to discover hardening arteries. If I had known he had the disease I would have advised him not to play football.\"\n\nGuise revealed Hughes' parents also \"died of what it appears to be heart disease.\"\n\nThe Lions doctors explained that injuries Hughes suffered in an exhibition game Sept. 4 against Buffalo had required two hospitalizations, and testing gave no indication that his heart was damaged. Prior to an exhibition Sept. 26 Hughes told one reporter:\n\n\"I’ve had sharp pains in my stomach and chest and they’ve made all sorts of tests but nobody seems to be able to figure them out. I want to play though. They aren’t that bad.\"\n\nSharon Hughes said Chuck never felt the same after the exhibition game injury.\n\n\"He then always seemed to have heartburn and was always asking for Alka-Seltzer,\" she says.\n\n\"It’s pretty rare and unusual to have a 28-year-old athlete die from atherosclerotic coronary heart disease,\" said Michael Emery, co-director of the Sports Cardiology Center at the Cleveland Clinic. \"If 50 years ago an athlete received the typical evaluation athletes get today, significant coronary heart disease would still not likely be found because our typical cardiac preparticipation evaluations in young athletes focuses on inherited genetic heart conditions affecting the heart muscle or electrical system. It’s one thing to find coronary heart disease after the fact from an autopsy but determining that in advance would have been extremely difficult back then.\n\n\"We’ve done tremendous work in the last 50 years of lowering people’s chances of dying from a heart attack with better diagnostics — such as calcium scoring — recognizing who is most at risk, modifying those risk factors and treating people with medications such as statins and lifestyle changes,\" Emery said.\n\nTrying to pick up the pieces\n\nTwo days after the game, a mass was held at St. Aloysius Church on Washington Boulevard in downtown Detroit, and on that Wednesday the entire Lions team and front office — as well as representatives from the NFL — attended the service and burial in San Antonio.\n\nAn education scholarship fund for the Hughes' son was quickly established while letters of sympathy poured were sent to the team and the Hughes family.\n\nBy the end of the week Sharon Hughes received a personal heartfelt sympathy letter from President Richard Nixon that read in part:\n\n\"Our thoughts and those of countless fellow Americans are with you as we share your grief on your husband’s death. The tragedy that took him at such an early age is lamented by all who knew him and by countless admirers who so appreciated his skill and good sportsmanship.\"\n\nJeff Haag, a former newspaper writer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who has been working on a Chuck Hughes biography manuscript for several years, was 9 years old when he watched the Lions receiver die on television.\n\n“It always had an enormous impact on me because I didn’t have the concept of death associated with the game that I was falling in love with,\" Haag said recently. \"It was a surreal experience. The camera close-up of Steve Owens on the sideline with his helmet off and a very worried look on his face is an image that has always stuck with me.\"\n\nThe late Lions linebacker Wayne Walker told Haag in 2007, \"After that day, the only thing that really mattered to me was going back to the locker room with the same number of guys I’d gone out there with. Screw that, 'Winning is everything' nonsense.\"\n\nCoaches finally began practices on that following Thursday in preparation for a Monday night game against the Packers in Green Bay. The team announced the players would wear black bands on their sleeve in memory of Hughes and that his No. 85 was retired.\n\nIn addition, the Lions revealed their team physicians were creating a cardiac unit containing treatment machines and auxiliary equipment and they would be taking a portable cardiac unit to road games. In making the announcement, Guise said, \"even if we’d have had this special equipment there, considering the autopsy findings of massive cardiac damage, it probably wouldn’t have been of any benefit in the Hughes case.\"\n\nIn the Monday night game, the Lions tied the Packers, 14-14, and went on to end the season with a 7-6-1 record.\n\n\"We lost everything when Chuck passed away and it was really tough to play the rest of the season,\" Greg Landry said. “We had a good team and a good record up to that point but our hearts weren’t in it after that.\"\n\nIn the months following her husband’s death, Lions quarterback Bill Munson introduced Hughes' widow to high-profile Detroit attorney Joe Louisell. In October 1972, two months after Louisell’s own untimely death, Sharon Hughes, left with a toddler to care for, filed a $21.5 million malpractice lawsuit against Henry Ford Hospital, alleging the failure to diagnose the potentially fatal condition. Two years later the suit was settled for an undisclosed amount of money after three days of testimony at a jury trial.\n\nNow 76, Hughes is retired after working for the school system in Sheridan, Texas. Her son Shane, 51, is married, without children, and works for Capital Group in San Antonio.\n\nHowever, she’s disappointed that her husband's No. 85 was first reissued by the Lions in 2005 for wide receiver Kevin Johnson who requested the number. Others who have since worn the number include Tony Scheffler and Eric Ebron, and this year wide receiver Tom Kennedy wears 85.\n\n\"The family has not appreciated that and we really think it should have remained retired,\" she said.\n\nHow does she remember her late husband?\n\n\"Chuck was a very kind, congenial person who laughed a lot with a distinct giggle. He was a good husband and a good father, and Shane was a delight in his life,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/03"}]}

They had argued the money was used legitimately and that the allegations had defined too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.\n\nJudge Benedicte de Perthuis said Le Pen had been \"at the heart\" of the scheme.\n\nLe Pen's removal from the race is likely to intensify a debate in France over how judges police politics.\n\nSince her first defeat to President Emmanuel Macron in 2017, Le Pen has patiently worked on softening her image, tacking her party towards the political mainstream and striving to appear as a leader-in-waiting rather than a radical anti-system opponent.\n\nShe now presides over the single biggest party in the National Assembly.\n\nThe judges also gave Le Pen a four-year prison sentence − of which two years are a suspended sentence − and a 100,000 Euro fine. She is almost certain to appeal, and neither of those penalties would be applied until her appeals are exhausted.\n\nBut her five-year ineligibility sentence kicks in immediately, via a so-called \"provisional execution\" measure requested by prosecutors, and will only be lifted if any appeal is upheld before the election. She retains her parliamentary seat until her mandate ends.\n\nArnaud Benedetti, a political analyst who has written a book on the RN, said Le Pen's five-year ban was a watershed moment in French politics that would reverberate across parties and through the electorate.\n\n\"This is a seismic political event,\" he said. \"Inevitably, it's going to reshuffle the pack, particularly on the right.\"\n\nAppeals in France can take months or even years.\n\nRN President Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 29-year-old right-hand man, now looks set to become the party's de facto candidate for the 2027 election.\n\nWhile he has helped expand the RN's appeal among younger voters, experts say it's unclear whether he has the experience to win over the broader electorate the RN needs to secure victory in 2027.\n\n\"I am not sure that Jordan Bardella's political proposition is mature enough to be able to compete credibly in the presidential election,\" Benedetti said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/football/sepp-blatter-michel-platini-fifa-acquitted-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini acquitted of fraud in Swiss Court | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer FIFA and UEFA Presidents Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have been acquitted of fraud, forgery and mismanagement in a court in Switzerland on Friday.\n\nThe trial centered on a payment made by FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, to Platini in 2011.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nToulouse CNN —\n\nWhen he was first elected French President in 2017, Emmanuel Macron promised that over the next five years he would do everything to ensure people would no longer have “any reason to vote for the extremes.”\n\nUnfortunately for the French electorate, Macron fell short of this promise to stem the rise of the far-right. In the wake of his 2017 victory, the political landscape shifted dramatically, with Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party being the main beneficiary.\n\nNow, just days away from France’s presidential election on Sunday, Macron again faces Le Pen in a rematch of their 2017 contest – and this time, Le Pen is riding a late surge in support that puts her a breath behind Macron’s lead.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Macron’s administration flirted with the same right-wing themes that have powered Le Pen’s rise – including Islam, security and immigration. Indeed, the entire political landscape in France is not immune to the appeal of policies that have profound effects on anyone who was not born White and on French soil.\n\nWhether or not Macron retains his seat, the effects of the creeping acceptance of the premises fueling Le Pen’s rise will be profound.\n\nThe focus on French Muslims, in particular, has been marked by a steady increase in fear-mongering for votes over the past 30 years. As successive waves of terrorist attacks in France galvanized public opinion since the mid-1980s, state authorities have been trying to create a framework to oversee Muslim religious practices and organization, through the idea of creating a “French Islam.”\n\nBut in the past 10 years, the threat has expanded from public safety to include Muslims being seen as an existential threat to the cultural identity of what is being called “traditional France.”\n\nSeeing an opportunity to ride a wave of discontent, politicians have pushed measures instrumentalizing the once liberal concept of laïcité (France’s form of secularism), including banning full-face coverings and burkinis in public spaces.\n\nWhile Macron is seen as an alternative to the far-right, he has also attempted to play both sides – putting on a liberal face for an international audience, while quietly embracing the very policies that the far-right has championed at home.\n\nTo lead this charge, Macron appointed Gérald Darmanin to the Ministry of Interior, one of the most powerful ministries in France. Darmanin has polarized the electorate with a staunch support for the French police, gaining strong support from influential police unions while alienating much of the left.\n\nFurthermore, critics accuse Darmanin of playing into anti-Muslim hatred with inflammatory rhetoric and action. In a vivid illustration of the Macron Administration’s rightward shift, last year Darmanin accused Le Pen of “being soft on Islam” in the midst of the debate around the Law Strengthening Respect For the Principles of the Republic (Anti-Separatism Law) of August 2021.\n\nThe anti-separatism bill was part of Macron’s strategy ahead of the 2022 presidential election to take some wind out of the far-right’s sails.\n\nUnder the law, non-profit organizations are subject to signing a “contract of republican commitment” – by which they must pledge respect to liberty, equality, fraternity, human dignity and public order. As a result, public authorities can arbitrarily deny, claim reimbursement or withdraw support to associations they deem are not respecting said values.\n\nSome associations fear that the heart of their activities (such as providing support to undocumented people, or human rights activist groups denouncing government discriminatory policies) could be deemed a violation of public order – and as a consequence, lose their funding.\n\nFacing a fractured field on the left, analysts predicted Macron was trying to lure some right-leaning voters away from Le Pen by taking action on some of the far right’s focal issues. Indeed, Darmanin declared in February 2022 that he wished that “far-right voters would vote for us (Macron’s party)”.\n\nMeanwhile, Le Pen has done her own version of a face-lift, de-emphasizing the harsher elements of her platform, while refusing to concede the underlying ideology that her party pioneered over the past 30 years.\n\nHer campaign promises include amending the Constitution to restrict immigration, family reunification and asylum that she deems a threat to France’s identity. Le Pen’s manifesto also contains measures for a legal distinction between “native-born French” and “others,” for access to employment or social benefits.\n\nLe Pen also announced her intention to extend the ban on the wearing of the headscarf in public spaces on the grounds of protecting Laïcité and the 1905 Law on Separation of Church and State. Laïcité has been understood for most of the 20th century as imposing neutrality upon the state and its civil servants, while guaranteeing religious freedom and freedom of conscience for private individuals\n\nBut since the 1990s, the understanding of laïcité has evolved and been interpreted as limiting religious expressions, more specifically Muslim ones. This has primarily been implemented through legislation restricting the wearing of visible religious signs, especially the wearing of the headscarf by some Muslim women.\n\nMacron sometimes unwittingly feeds into this narrative, once asking a young French Muslim woman wearing a headscarf if she was wearing a headscarf “by choice” or “by force” and complimented her when she confirmed it was by choice.\n\nWhile Macron’s statement was baffling, as it’s unlikely he would have asked such a question to a Catholic nun wearing a veil, a Jew wearing a yarmulke or a Sikh wearing a turban, the President is clearly trying to backpedal from the actions of his administration and pretend measures like the Anti-Separatism Law never happened.\n\nOnce again, Muslims, and especially Muslim women, are being instrumentalized for electoral purposes. Regardless of who wins the election, the far-right has already won. They are shaping the agenda of French political debate. If Le Pen does not win this time, she or someone like her will most likely win another time.\n\nFrench Muslims are tired of being pawns in this political game. Muslims comprise an estimated 8.8% of the population of France yet take up almost all of the political and media discourse, while their voices are left out of the conversation.\n\nIslam and immigration are topics that the far-right loves to use for their agenda, and unfortunately Macron, and those before him, fell into this trap. If Macron wins, he will have to make amends with those he has affected. And he and his administration will have to stop treating their French Muslim citizens as if they were a population that needed to be tamed.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThere is a need to proactively and constructively engage with Muslims, put in place programs that fight discrimination, and stop weaponizing laïcité as a tool for political identity. Muslims are simply not the threat some politicians and pundits make them out to be. France needs to allow Muslims to be full French citizens on their own terms, to express their identities openly and honestly, in a manner that is both true to their faith yet unambiguously French.\n\nWhether or not Macron or Le Pen wins this weekend, there is no doubt that the political landscape is shifting under the feet of French voters.", "authors": ["Rim-Sarah Alouane"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/12/13/steve-bannon-donald-trump-europe-nationalism-populist-movement/2200098002/", "title": "Steve Bannon: Fired architect of Trump's campaign insists he's still ...", "text": "LONDON – Once portrayed as one of Washington’s most powerful men, Steve Bannon is either back or he’s still out in the political wilderness. He’s either a dangerous xenophobe who trades in conspiracy theories or a Harvard-educated former investment banker who claims his true mission is to stand up for the little guy at any cost.\n\nNobody knows for sure – apparently not even Bannon himself.\n\nWhat’s clear is that nearly 18 months after the architect of President Donald Trump’s \"America First\" national populism was fired as White House chief strategist, Bannon insists he remains a key player in an ongoing global political insurrection he defines as a clash between the legitimate demands and grievances of working-class citizens versus a corrupt, out-of-touch, cosmopolitan, liberal elite.\n\nBannon’s many critics counter he’s more a skilled provocateur whose Svengali-like instincts propel him to controversial political battlegrounds where he sows confusion and discontent. Think of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, corruption probes in China, far-right nationalist campaigns in France, Hungary and elsewhere.\n\n\"There’s populist movements everywhere, whether it’s with Brazil and (new President Jair Messias) Bolsonaro, in Pakistan with (Prime Minister Imran) Khan, in India (with Prime Minister Narendra Modi) or throughout Europe. I go all over the world to give talks. And if I wanted to, I could stay outside the United States for a whole year doing just that,\" Bannon said in a recent interview with USA TODAY in Britain’s capital.\n\n\"This populist movement is all over the world. People are looking for assistance. They are looking for guidance. They keep coming to me and saying hey, 'Tell me we're not alone, tell me this is all interconnected,'\" Bannon said in London.\n\nBut his remarks come amid at least a trio of accusations leveled against the 65-year-old former Hollywood producer and ex-chairman of far-right media outlet Breitbart:\n\nThat since leaving Trump’s inner circle in August last year and effectively acquiring pariah status, few people are really interested in what he has to say. Campaign rallies Bannon held ahead of the U.S. midterm elections were poorly attended;\n\n\n\nThat his attempts to launch a populism-focused think tank-cum-foundation in the heart of Europe's political capital Brussels ahead of European parliamentary elections in May are being hampered by campaign-finance laws, as well as lukewarm interest from some of Europe’s most high-profile populist politicians;\n\n\n\nAnd that his efforts to investigate abuses of power by President Xi Jinping and China's ruling Communist Party, as well as unite far-right political groups across borders, represents not only the internationalism he roundly rejects, but the latter may also be a form of election meddling or interference that succeeds by appealing to voters’ insecurities about immigration, jobs and cultural change.\n\n\"One wonders how an 'America First' ideologue can pursue his political project anywhere other than in America,\" political scholars Kemal Derviş and Caroline Conroy wrote in an op-ed published by Project Syndicate, an online hub for commentary and analysis, in late November. \"By joining forces with the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen – herself an open supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin – Bannon seems to have in mind a new type of 'neo-nationalist international,'\" they wrote.\n\nIn \"Populism: A Very Short Introduction,\" the political scientists Cas Mudde and\n\nCristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser write that \"by itself populism can offer neither complex nor comprehensive answers to the political questions that modern societies generate.\" They describe it as a \"thin-centered\" or \"host\" ideology politically left or right.\n\nYet none of this, perhaps predictably for a political operative who rose from relative obscurity to help Trump win an improbable election victory, appears to bother Bannon.\n\nIn the interview, he countered that his campaigning for the U.S. midterms did not bring out large crowds because it was deliberately focused on \"grassroots leaders.\"\n\nHe said he went into \"living rooms, to prayer groups\" to reach people who had a \"force multiplier effect\" – influential members of a community who can be relied on to get out the vote. \"Our mission was to support the Trump program,\" he said. \"Go back and look at Buffalo, at Staten Island, all the districts we went to – you'll see packed audiences.\"\n\nIn Staten Island, where Bannon screened his documentary \"Trump at War,\" 38 people showed up. The event in Buffalo drew a few hundred Trump supporters.\n\nBannon spoke to USA TODAY last month, a few days after he appeared at a media conference in Scotland where there were calls, including from Scotland’s top politician Nicola Sturgeon, for him to be dropped from the event over claims he normalizes far-right, racist views. Later the same day, he took part in a debate at Oxford University. Bannon’s presence there, too, sparked protests and calls for a boycott.\n\n\"People can play gotcha all day long but it’s not going to work. It’s a lie. I have done thousands of interviews, speeches, broadcasts and there’s not one racist statement,” Bannon said, responding to those claims. \"People think the Muslim (travel) ban is racism, it’s not. The Supreme Court upheld up it. They think the immigration policy at the (Mexican) border is racist, it’s not. It’s a humanitarian policy,\" he added.\n\nImmigrant-rights groups and federal and district judges concluded both of these Trump policies were guided by racial animus. They were condemned on moral grounds by allies such as British Prime Minister Theresa May and by religious leaders, including Pope Francis. \"Let them call you racist,\" Bannon told a crowd at a far-right rally in France in March. \"Let them call you 'nativist.' Wear it as a badge of honor,\" he said.\n\nLess than a week after the interview, Bannon was in New York City, where he announced during a press conference he was partnering with Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire, to form something called the \"Rule of Law Fund.\"\n\nBannon described this as a $100 million effort to come to the aid of Chinese executives, politicians and government officials unfairly targeted by China’s government for persecution. He said he would serve as the fund’s executive chairman. No details were released on how it would operate, why this was happening now or indeed how the fund’s managers would select appropriate cases. However, Bannon has for years argued that China is waging an economic war against the United States, a line of thinking that is thought to have inspired his former boss – Trump – who has threatened to slap more tariffs on China if trade-deal talks with Beijing fall apart.\n\n\"China's my baby,\" Bannon said in the interview in London.\n\nHe then took from his bag a book he said he always carries with him. In the book, \"Unrestricted Warfare,\" two former senior military officers in China’s People’s Liberation Army argue that since no country can hope to challenge the United States’ military supremacy, the next best option is to wear it down gradually through economic and information warfare. Bannon’s copy was well thumbed and full of Post-it notes.\n\nFledgling think tank\n\nBannon also said that next month the Movement, his fledgling think tank operation based out of a \"chateau\" in a wealthy suburb of Brussels, will start hosting conferences, dinners and other events that allow for the \"exchange of ideas.\"\n\nThese \"ideas\" will reflect his long-standing political beliefs, chiefly economic nationalism and anti-establishment populism. It will seek to unite anti-immigration, \"nativist,\" eurosceptic political groups as they prepare for battle in European Parliament elections next year. Mainstream political parties have historically controlled the parliament. A surge in support for populist parties could disrupt the European Union's broadly centrist policies on migration, economic policy and other salient issues.\n\nBannon referred to the Movement as a \"loose association\" that will be \"totally voluntary.\" He said he also wants to undertake \"detailed polling\" and to use data analytics to \"drive where the voters are\" – those persuadable ones who can sometimes determine the outcome of an election. It’s all part of a \"what I call a war room,\" he added, noting that \"it’s what we did for Trump in the U.S.: writing op-eds, booking people on media, surrogate media – all that. The last part of it is to do with grassroots social media and getting organized physically and getting out the vote.\"\n\nNigel Farage, a Trump ally credited with helping to engineer Brexit, Britain's 2016 vote to the leave European Union, said \"eurosceptic groups in the EU have never been well coordinated despite similar goals.\" He said Bannon’s \"idea of a clearinghouse for ideas and sharing best practice is a good one – if parties choose to do it.\"\n\nBannon and Farage, and Brexit, have history.\n\n\"I got my chops here (in Britain) back in 2014 following Nigel Farage around\" when he was campaigning for the European parliamentary elections, Bannon said in the interview. Information unearthed by Emma Briant, a British academic, revealed Bannon's name was on Brexit-related corporate emails dating to October 2015, when he was a vice president of Cambridge Analytica, the same American-owned firm that has faced scrutiny as part of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Like in the U.S., British law prohibits foreign contributions to political campaigns. Bannon did not respond to a question on whether he ever worked for Brexit campaigners.\n\nLegal hurdles\n\nStill, election-law experts say Europe’s campaign-finance laws are a major obstacle in the Movement’s way because only four out of 28 EU member states have no restrictions on foreign funding: Belgium, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands, according to Kristine Berzina of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank.\n\nAnd the British newspaper The Guardian reported that these restrictions apply even to \"in-kind donations,\" meaning that Bannon could not legally provide polling and other campaign-related services in many of the European countries he wants to operate.\n\nBannon, who said he's using his own money and funds from \"high net worth European individuals\" to pay for the Movement, said he would be active \"to the degree that election law allows us.\" He said the organization has at least 12 people on its payroll.\n\nOne of them is Mischaël Modrikamen, a Belgian lawyer in whose \"chateau\" the Movement's office is based. Modrikamen is also the leader of Belgium's right-wing People's Party. His office said he was too busy with official party business to address questions about the Movement. Bannon chose not to comment on a follow-up question about the scope of the Movement's future activities given the legal scenario.\n\nHope Not Hate, a London-based advocacy organization that campaigns against racism and far-right ideas, cautioned against accepting Bannon's version of events.\n\nThe Movement \"isn’t going anywhere at the moment,\" said spokesman Nick Ryan. \"He’s fallen foul of election laws in just about every country where he’s tried to float his rabble-rousing message. He uses the media to promote his particularly nasty brand of toxicity. It’s entirely possible he’s using media to hype it up when it isn’t really established.\" Ryan added that \"the media should be careful not to talk (Bannon) up.\"\n\nMeanwhile, support from key European populism leaders for Bannon’s project has been tepid despite him saying in the interview that they are \"1,000 percent supportive.\"\n\n\"Bannon is an American and has no place in a European political party,\" Jérôme Rivière, a spokesman for France's far-right National Rally, said in July. \"We reject any supranational entity and are not participating in the creating [sic] of anything with Bannon.\"\n\nA month later, Alexander Gauland, one of two co-leaders of Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant party, Alternative for Germany, also rebuffed Bannon, saying the \"interests of the anti-establishment parties in Europe are quite divergent.\"\n\nGauland added: \"We are not in America.\"\n\nHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has wished Bannon's project \"a lot of success\" and Bannon has said he plans to \"spend a lot of time in Hungary between now and (Europe's) election day.\" Orbán has called all refugees \"Muslim invaders\" and used anti-Semitic tropes to demonize and force out of Hungary a U.S.-accredited university funded by the Hungary-born Jewish billionaire George Soros. USA TODAY asked Orbán's spokesman Zoltán Kovács to clarify the Hungarian government's working relationship with Bannon. Kovács emailed back comments Orbán made in September.\n\n\"I would like to remind everyone that the European elections are held by everyone voting in their own country for the parties taking part in the elections there and included on the party list. This means Americans cannot be candidates and trans-European movements also cannot be launched,\" Orbán said in a speech in Strasbourg.\n\nStill, Matthew Goodwin, author of \"National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy\" and an authority on the subject based at Britain's University of Kent, said populism and economic nationalists are likely more durable than the liberal left are willing to admit. He said polling shows, for example, far-right political parties will probably increase their seats in the European Parliament in May irrespective of whether Bannon's organization is somehow involved in boosting their cause.\n\n\"The mainstream is going to be squeezed again,\" Goodwin predicted, noting that issues such as Europe's refugee crisis and cultural and economic changes brought about by years of immigration are still pushing many voters to the right.\n\nIn fact, a recent study by Washington-based Pew Research found that a third to a half of Europeans are wary of global engagement no matter how it is defined. In Britain, it’s 52 percent, the exact percentage who voted for Brexit. In Greece, it’s 83 percent.\n\nIn the U.S., 57 percent feel this way, according to the study.\n\nIn early December,, anti-government protesters in France who are angry with President Emmanuel Macron for what they claim are a range of policies that favor the wealthy over the working class, vowed to continue weeks of demonstrations even though Macron’s cabinet walked back a planned fuel-tax increase, a hot-button issue. This week, Macron raised France's minimum wage to appease protesters.\n\n\"This is springing up on a planetary basis,\" said Bannon, referring to interest in the populism movement he has done so much to publicize. \"Whether I'm speaking to guys in Italy, men and women in France, or in Switzerland, it's the same audience. Same working-class audience as in New Mexico or Texas or wherever.\"\n\nIn the interview, Bannon accused the media, including USA TODAY, of being \"virulently anti-Trump,\" of being \"elitist\" and of \"atrocious coverage\" that was already failing to recognize, among other things, that the European parliamentary elections in May would be the \"next big move\" or test for populism after Trump's election in 2016.\n\nThroughout, he oscillated between being personable and aggressively accusatory.\n\n\"You media guys are all phony, lazy and dumb,\" he said. \"And I want that in the article.\"\n\nBannon abruptly ended the interview because he needed to travel to Oxford to take part in the debate at the university's student union, a prestigious chamber that dates to 1823 and has hosted numerous world leaders and well-known public figures. Asked by USA TODAY whether he would be dressing up for the occasion and whether a populist would feel at home there, Bannon said: \"Dude, I may not even wear socks.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/europe/war-on-woke-europe-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "'Anti-woke' crusade has come to Europe. Its effects could be chilling ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIf 2020 renewed calls for racial equality as Black Lives Matter protests exploded throughout Europe, 2021 brought in the backlash as parts of the political establishment waged a so-called “war against woke.”\n\nStripped of its original meaning of a person being awake to progressive issues, “woke” has been appropriated from the Black vernacular and turned into a political lightning rod in the West’s culture wars. It is now used pejoratively by lawmakers and pundits from both left and right, criticizing the perceived excesses of social and racial justice movements.\n\nThe politicization of the word, which has seen degrees of success in the United States, has bolstered political resistance to calls for more equality in Europe. The amorphous term has also been interpreted differently, depending on where it is deployed.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, woke is used to “describe anything that could previously [be] described as ‘politically correct,’” Evan Smith, a visiting fellow at Australia’s Flinders University and author of “No Platform: A History of Anti-Fascism and the Limits of Free Speech,” told CNN. The term is “used to describe a broad range of ideas [and] movements concerned with social justice,” including anti-racism, intersectional feminism, trans rights and critical histories of the British empire, he said.\n\nCultural institutions and academics have been targeted by members of the ruling Conservative Party for supporting those movements. In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson accused a charity set up in the name of Winston Churchill of trying to “airbrush” the “giant achievements” of the former wartime leader.\n\nThe charity’s mistake? Being accused in rightwing tabloids of being “woke,” for changing its name from the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust to The Churchill Fellowship and acknowledging that Churchill’s views on race would not be accepted today.\n\n“The Prime Minister has always been clear that whilst it’s legitimate to examine Britain’s history and we should aim to educate people about all aspects of our complex past, both good and bad, and not erase them,” the spokesperson said at the time according to PA Media. “We need to focus on addressing the present, and not attempt to rewrite the past and get sucked into the never-ending debate about which well-known historical figures are sufficiently pure or politically correct to remain in public view.”\n\nThese anti-woke government interventions have power. They “sharpen the public’s sense of moral purpose and help to galvanise voters in a country they perceive to be under siege,” wrote Nesrine Malik in the left-of-center newspaper, the Guardian, in October. “They include the defunding of academic institutions and museums, and even interfering in the appointment of senior personnel at the BBC.”\n\nMany in the French establishment view “woke” as a heinous US import of theories on race, post-colonialism and gender, which they say pose a risk to French values and identity, Samuel Hayat, a politics research fellow at French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), told CNN.\n\nA protester holds a banner on Champ de Mars, in Paris on June 6, 2020, as part of Black Lives Matter protests in the city. GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe term gained traction among French politicians and its press in 2021, say French observers. In May, Elizabeth Moreno, French President Emmanuel Macron’s party diversity minister, told Bloomberg that “woke culture is something very dangerous, and we shouldn’t bring it to France.” When asked in August whether “wokism [is] a just cause, in your opinion” by weekly political magazine Le Point, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is the socialist candidate in the upcoming presidential elections, said: “it is very important that journalists shed light on these emerging movements, but I will not be campaigning on them.”\n\nWhen a major French dictionary included a gender-inclusive pronoun in its online edition in November, French lawmaker François Jolivet, from Macron’s party, called the dictionary’s authors on Twitter “militants of a cause that has nothing to do with France: #wokisme.”\n\n“Woke is seen as a threat that comes from a society thought to be multicultural and violent and does not have the same values on secularism that France does,” Hayat said.\n\nThe word plays against the French egalitarian, anti-elitist mindset, said Hayat, placing all the theories someone might struggle to understand, such as intersectional feminism, “into a single phenomenon that came from outside France.”\n\nAs Franco-American relations plunged to new lows this fall over a security deal the US forged in secret with the UK and Australia, French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer opened a think tank to uphold French values against what he described as “wokeism.”\n\nSpeaking to France’s Le Monde newspaper about his think tank, Blanquer said “wokeism” is an ideology that “fragments and divides, and has conquered certain political, media and academic circles.” He added that the backlash to “wokeism” helped “bring Donald Trump to power; France and its youth must escape this.”\n\nNew bogeyman\n\nAccording to Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar from Toulouse Capitole University, woke’s arrival in France’s culture wars is part of a wider reaction among members of Macron’s party, La République en Marche (LREM), against left-wing and progressive views, rearing its head after the brutal murder of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020.\n\nPaty’s death followed multiple Islamic terrorist attacks on French soil. But the French government’s response to his beheading opened up a full-scale culture war over secularism, freedom of speech and Islamophobia as the country’s interior minister closed a Muslim group that tracked anti-Muslim hate crime.\n\nThat period also saw “Islamo-leftism” – a controversial yet ill-defined far-right term accusing left-wing academics and activists of enabling Islamic extremism or terrorism – enter the mainstream political discourse as Education Minister Blanquer blamed it for “wreaking havoc” in universities.\n\nHe was backed by 100 academics who, in an open letter to Le Monde, blamed imported “indigenist [sic], racialist, and ‘decolonial’ ideologies,” in French universities for “nourishing hatred of the ‘Whites’ and of France.”\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron is seen at a December 13, 2021, press conference, months before the country's presidential election. Atilla Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBy the start of 2021, France’s Minister of Higher Education Frédérique Vidal announced the launch of an investigation into French academic research on CNews, a French channel that has been compared to Fox News. It would look “at everything through the prism of wanting to fracture and divide,” while singling out colonialism and race studies, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe French research organization Vidal tasked with launching the inquiry agreed to carry out the research. It however noted that Islamo-leftism was not a scientific term and condemned “attempts to delegitimize different fields of research, such as postcolonial studies, intersectional studies,” Centre national de la recherche scientifique [CRNS] wrote in a press release.\n\nConflating academics and researchers with Islamic extremism amounts to McCarthyism, said Alouane, referring to the anti-Communist crusade in the early 1950s by US Sen. Joe McCarthy.\n\nWeaponizing woke is another attempt at bringing academics, researchers and human rights activists to heel, say critics.\n\n“This is a witchhunt against people who question the status quo,” Alouane added. “Instead of trying to make things better, to tackle issues related to discrimination, racial profiling, and the history of French colonization … these academics [and] researchers are considered to be a threat to so-called Republican values.”\n\nIt also raises questions about academic freedoms, Hayat told CNN. France only needs to look at how Hungarian leaders chipped away at its education sector, banning gender studies in colleges and forcing the Central European University (CEU) out of the country for failing to comply with their nationalist worldview.\n\nWhile crude racial stereotypes over genetics and skin color are frowned on in mainstream contemporary discourse, terms like wokeism and Islamo-leftism serve to reinforce dog whistles such as, “they do not belong to our culture. They do not abide by our Christian values,” Alouane told CNN. “It is just neo-racism.”\n\nThe anti-woke discourse comes just months ahead of France’s presidential election, where the main ideological threat to Macron comes from the right and far right, not the supposed woke left, said Alouane.\n\nAccording to some polls, Macron may end up facing off against either far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen or the rightwing Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse in the second round of voting.\n\nAnti-woke rhetoric may be part of an effort to neutralize Macron’s right-wing opponents. It is an effort Alouane finds ironic. “The funny thing is, if a far-right candidate makes it to the second round, we will [be told] to save the Republic against the far right – even though this administration has been playing with far-right ideologies the whole time,” she said.\n\nChilling effect\n\nAs in France, many experts say the British government’s anti-woke crusade is aimed at making electoral gains.\n\nAided by right-wing elements of the British media, Johnson’s government has used the so-called “war on woke” as an opportunity to score points with their mainly English and Brexit-supporting electorate – some of whom switched allegiance from the opposition Labour Party at the 2019 general election.\n\n“It is fertile territory for the Conservatives as they are pressing a button that has been pressed a few decades now in regards [denouncements of] political correctness,” Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, told CNN.\n\nIt also places Labour in a difficult position as its leader, Keir Starmer, attempts to “shake off the ‘far left’ tag” the party gained under his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, author Evan Smith said.\n\nJohnson’s culture war tugs at the split in Labour, between its socially conservative members, who think the party is too preoccupied with identity politics, rather than class, and its younger and more diverse base, who are happy for Starmer to do more, say experts.\n\nHistory has been the main battleground, where the Conservative government pits patriotism against any attempt to reckon with Britain’s colonial past.\n\nIt is a narrative that has played out in the education sector, which has seen a government-picked commission release a race report that fended off calls to “decolonize” Britain’s schooling curriculum. Instead, it advocated for “a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modeled African/Britain.”\n\n“British history is not solely one of imperial imposition – Commonwealth history and literature reveals a more complex picture, in which ideas traveled in multiple directions, cultures mixed and positive relations formed that today underpin diaspora around the world, which many ethnic minority children in the UK will feel part of,” the report wrote. Critics accused the report of being a whitewash that puts a positive spin on slavery.\n\nSpeaking to the House of Commons last year, Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said “any school which teaches these elements of critical race theory as fact, or which promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views is breaking the law.”\n\nBoris Johnson's government has announced plans to combat so-called \"cancel culture\" in universities. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe government has not shied away from threats of intervention when cultural institutions follow progressive causes. If they “go too woke, they risk going broke,” Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said in October, reiterating his warning that such institutions could be defunded if they cave to “an aggressive brigade” of social justice activists.\n\nIn the last 18 months, heritage charity the National Trust faced threats to its funding from Conservative lawmakers for exploring its properties’ links to slavery and colonialism, and the Royal Museums Greenwich, in London, found itself under the microscope when the government reportedly refused to reappoint a trustee who advocated decolonizing school curriculums.\n\nThe Museums Association, which represents thousands of people working in the sector, warned of “a climate of fear” among “museums and museum staff, especially those working on subjects relating to Britain’s imperial past,” in response to a February meeting between museums, heritage bodies and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS], which Dowden headed at the time. “We support the rights of everyone working on these issues to do so free of interference, threats and intimidation,” the Museums Association added.\n\nThe BBC has also come under scrutiny from Conservative lawmakers calling for the license fee, which funds the broadcaster, to be scrapped.\n\n“A lot of Conservatives don’t like the state funding of a media company, and they think the BBC crowds out sympathetic broadcasters,” Bale said. “The whole anti-woke agenda to some extent is cover to move BBC from a license fee model to a subscriber-based one.”\n\nThis atmosphere can have a chilling effect on cultural institutions that may feel compelled to think twice about what programs they support or which people they hire. This is alleged to have played out at the BBC, when media executive Marcus Ryder’s job application was reportedly blocked due to his support of anti-racism initiatives. The BBC has strenuously denied those reports.\n\nSupporting anti-racism causes should not be an impartiality issue, Ryder told CNN. “What the BBC needs to do is re-examine its [impartiality] guidelines and decide how it should define ‘controversial’ and whether that can be independent of party politics,” he said. “And it needs to see how this framing works with people whose very existence sits outside the ‘normative standards’ – and this can apply to gender, race, sexuality, etc.”\n\nA BBC spokesperson told CNN that “impartiality is a core value of the BBC and something we apply to all our news coverage.” The spokesperson added: “The BBC plays an important role in informing and facilitating debate about subjects of public interest, some of which are divisive. That being said, the BBC is not impartial on racism or any other characteristics protected by law.”\n\nThe policing of institutions by culture warriors acts as a way to undermine the real, lived experience of minorities. It allows for concerns about racism, transphobia or violence against women to be framed as not being of material concern to ordinary people, Neema Begum, a British politics professor at the University of Nottingham, told CNN. The long-term effect of this is just “more polarization,” she added.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nBritain’s anti-woke crusade sometimes borders on the farcical – from a “woke watch” segment on GB News, a British television news channel critics say was set up to find an audience amid the culture wars, to a lawmaker bemoaning that civil servants are still “woke-ing from home.”\n\nNor has every skirmish against social justice movements been a win for the government. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused England’s national football team of engaging in “gesture politics” for taking the knee before its matches in a protest against racism, and refused to condemn those who booed the players for doing so.\n\nBritish Home Secretary Priti Patel accused the England football team of \"gesture politics\" for taking the knee before matches. Mike Egerton/PA/Getty Images\n\nBut the tactic backfired when the country rallied around the team after some of its players experienced racial abuse online in the aftermath of England’s Euro 2020 final defeat in July. By the end of the Euros, polling showed most England football fans supported the team taking the knee.\n\n“You don’t get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as ‘Gesture Politics’ & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we’re campaigning against, happens,” England footballer Tyrone Mings wrote in a Twitter post responding to a tweet by Patel condemning the post-final racism.\n\n“It is clear the British public cares quite a lot [about] the equalities agenda, and it is quite easy for that kind of [government] mobilization to backfire,” Christopher Bertram, emeritus professor of social and political philosophy at Bristol University, told CNN.\n\nIt also shows that while the anti-woke messaging works with their base, British society is getting more multi-ethnic, tolerant and woke, Bale said.\n\n“The Conservatives are going to have to make a decision if they carry on railing against the way society is going,” Bale said. “There is a long-term risk for them as it alienates [younger] future voters who they need to keep on side,” Bale added. “There is a limited number of grumpy, older White men to get off on this kind of stuff.”\n\nEven the 73-year-old grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames, has heard enough, calling the furor over the Churchill Trust “so sad and so pathetic” in an interview with the Times. “Apparently anyone who modernizes anything or does anything to remotely bring it up to date is ‘woke.’” he said. “It’s absolute b****cks.”", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week", "text": "1.

The charges come with a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the chance of parole.\n\nGendron wore a red jumpsuit and had his hands cuffed in front of him in court Monday. He answered “yes” or “no” to several questions affirming he understood why he was pleading guilty and, on the individual counts, said the word “guilty.” He showed no emotion during the hearing.\n\nThe guilty plea ensures there will be no state trial and Gendron will not appeal, defense attorney Brian Parker said afterward.\n\n“This critical step represents a condemnation of the racist ideology that fueled his horrific actions on May 14. Before he is sentenced to life without the possibility of parole on February 15, the surviving victims and deceased victims’ family members will all have a chance to address the court, the community and our client directly,” he said. “It is our hope that a final resolution of the state charges will help in some small way to keep the focus on the needs of the victims and the community.”\n\nGendron’s parents said they remain shocked and shattered over the shooting.\n\n“Our hearts are broken over the devastation he caused to the innocent victims he killed and wounded, their families, and the African-American community in Buffalo and beyond,” said Paul and Pamela Gendron in a statement. “With today’s plea of guilty, he will be held accountable for his actions.”\n\n“We are thankful to the law-enforcement professionals who investigated this case and will continue to provide any assistance we can. We pray for healing for everyone affected.”\n\nPayton Gendron, seen here on May 19 in court, pleaded guilty on November 28 to charges of terrorism as a hate crime and murder. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nErie County District Attorney John Flynn described the attack as a racist hate crime and outlined the timeline of the mass killing.\n\n“In just over two minutes the defendant, with the intent to murder as many African Americans as he could, killed 10 innocent Black people and attempted to kill three others,” Flynn said in a news conference after the hearing.\n\nThe guilty plea comes six months after Gendron used an illegally modified semiautomatic rifle to carry out the mass shooting. Flynn said he got a letter from the defense a few weeks ago saying the defendant was willing to plead guilty.\n\nThe victims, including customers, employees and an armed security guard, ranged in age from 20 to 86. Eleven of the 13 people shot were Black and two were White, officials said.\n\nSocial media posts and a lengthy document written by the gunman reveal he had been planning his attack for months and had visited the Tops supermarket several times previously. He posted that he chose Tops because it was in a particular ZIP code in Buffalo that had the highest percentage of Black people close enough to where he lived in Conklin, New York.\n\nThe document outlined his goals for the attack, according to Flynn: “To kill as many African Americans as possible, avoid dying and spread ideals.”\n\nGendron also faces multiple federal hate crime charges, which carry the potential for the death penalty, in addition to several firearms charges. He has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\n\nGendron apologized to White man during spree\n\nFlynn on Monday outside court laid out the evidence against Gendron, which was primarily based on surveillance video from the Tops supermarket and from a camera attached to Gendron’s helmet that was live-streaming the attack.\n\nGendron arrived to the grocery store with a modified semiautomatic rifle and targeted people because they were Black, Flynn said. At one point, Gendron pointed his rifle at a White man but did not kill him and said “sorry” because the man was White, “thus further demonstrating the defendant’s racially motivated attack,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron shot four people outside the grocery store and nine more inside before surrendering to Buffalo Police officers who responded to the scene, according to the indictment.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said following the attack that the AR-15 style rifle used in the shooting was legally purchased in New York State, but was modified with a high-capacity magazine, which is not legal in the state.\n\nThe state charge of terrorism motivated by hate, passed in 2020, had never been used before in New York.\n\n“No individual in the history of the state of New York has been found guilty of domestic terrorism charge motivated by hate until today,” he said.\n\nHe made the case that the gunman had not achieved his goals.\n\n“This racist murderer did not fulfill what he set out to accomplish. He failed. He failed miserably because today this city, this community, is stronger and better than it ever was, and we have shown the world that racism has no part in our community.”\n\nFamilies of victims take issue with hearing\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I can feel pieces of that bullet in his back': Survivor's mom testifies before Congress 01:42 - Source: CNN\n\nSeveral families of the victims spoke alongside attorney Ben Crump on Monday and took issue with what they described as the legal system’s overly sympathetic treatment of the gunman.\n\n“I was angry how the judge was constantly talking to this (suspect) like he was a little prepubescent sixth grade boy,” said Mark Talley, 33, the son of Geraldine Talley. “I was angry that they didn’t have him look at the family of the victims’ faces that he scarred for life.”\n\nZeneta Everhart, whose son Zaire Goodman was shot in the neck but survived, said the gunman’s voice in court sounded “nonchalant.”\n\n“His voice made me feel sick,” she said. “This country is inherently violent. It is inherently racist, and his voice showed me that because he didn’t care. You could hear it in that voice. He didn’t care.”\n\nCrump said that Gendron – despite his expected life sentence – appeared to have achieved his goals: to kill as many Black people as he could, to survive, and to get mass attention for his 180-page document.\n\n“Even though I know this is a step in the right direction in our journey for justice, it still is very painful that the goals that he had set out for, he seems to be accomplishing,” he said.\n\nTerrence Connors, who represents the families of seven people who were killed in the shooting and two who were injured, spoke to CNN previously about the suspect’s plan to plead guilty.\n\n“This is a remarkable group of families that I speak for,” he said. “The tragedy is still heavy in their hearts, but they’ve turned this nightmare into positive action. From their standpoint, he has become irrelevant to their lives. Their lives have become about making something positive from this horrible tragedy.”", "authors": ["Mark Morales Eric Levenson Kristina Sgueglia", "Mark Morales", "Eric Levenson", "Kristina Sgueglia"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/opinions/hov-lane-texas-abortion-fetal-personhood-filipovic/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Stop cheering for a fetus's right to ride in an HOV lane | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nA pregnant Texas woman who was pulled over for driving alone in the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane, meant for cars carrying at least two people, has turned the state’s strict anti-abortion law on its head, claiming to police who stopped her in Dallas that she had a passenger in the car: her fetus.\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nBrandy Bottone got a ticket anyway. According to the Dallas Morning News, which first reported the interaction, Bottone told the officer there was another person in her car – her baby girl, due in early August.\n\nIn recalling the argument she made to police during the encounter, she told CNN, “I’m not trying to make a huge political stance here, but do you understand that this is a baby?” It seems Texas’s strict anti-abortion law, which defines an “unborn child” as “an individual living member of the homo sapiens species,” only applies when it can be used against women – not when it can help them get out of a traffic ticket.\n\nBottone told CNN that her own views on the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade aren’t “really why I made the stance that I did.” Nonetheless, some abortion rights supporters cheered her actions, using social media to broadcast how pleased they are to see a clear example of the absurdity of defining a fetus as a separate individual person. HOV lanes, after all, are supposed to incentivize carpooling to cut down on traffic congestion and environmental damage; a fetus doesn’t exactly have an option to be in a separate vehicle, or anywhere else.\n\nIt’s understandable, given how disheartening the last weeks have been for those of us who believe women have a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, to want to cheer for the moments that clarify just how dystopian anti-abortion laws really are. But as satisfying as this gotcha moment might be, establishing a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus as a separate person imbued with the same rights as you or I is a step down a dangerous path. It is absurd to be sure. But it’s also incredibly perilous for women’s rights and for a reality-based society more broadly.\n\nFetal personhood laws, which anti-abortion groups are pushing – and which would extend legal rights to fertilized eggs even before a pregnancy is established – would take us to farcical ends. They would make abortion murder and could very well also outlaw many common fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), as well as several of the most effective and popular forms of birth control.\n\nBut making a fetus a person under the law would call much more into question as well. For example: When does child support begin? America has birthright citizenship, but if birth is no longer the starting point of legal personhood, is any person conceived on US soil an American citizen (and how would one even prove the location of one’s conception)? Can a woman who had sex on a fertile day drive in the HOV lane 48 hours later if she’s pretty sure she’s pregnant, given that there’s no way to test to see if your egg was just fertilized? What kind of proof would a traffic cop need?\n\nMore seriously, given that as many as half of fertilized eggs don’t implant and are flushed out of a woman’s body before she even knows she’s pregnant, and that as many as one in five known pregnancies ends in miscarriage, what kind of legal investigations and criminal liabilities might women face when their fertilized eggs don’t become pregnancies, or their fetuses die?\n\nWhen a child dies unexpectedly and inexplicably, the state routinely investigates. And if a parent did something that led to the child’s death, they might be charged with murder or criminal neglect. Do we trust that states that have already criminalized women for having a miscarriage or using drugs while pregnant won’t prosecute pregnant women who miscarry if they do something that research suggests could pose risk to a fetus – for example, smoking, being under- or overweight, drinking several cups of coffee, eating deli meats, ordering a steak medium rare, sitting in a hot tub or cleaning the cat’s litter box?\n\nIf a fertilized egg is deemed a person, America’s mortality rate will immediately become the highest in the world – suddenly, a majority of Americans will die before they are ever born.\n\nImbuing a fertilized egg with full personhood rights would also put women’s health at risk. Take ectopic pregnancies, where the fertilized egg implants somewhere outside of the uterus, typically in the fallopian tube. These pregnancies will never turn into live births; instead, they risk rupturing the fallopian tube as they grow, putting the pregnant woman’s life at risk.\n\nThere are a variety of treatments for ectopic pregnancies, but the most responsible ones remove or stop the pregnancy while preserving the woman’s fertility. Establish a fertilized egg as a person, though, and it gets more complicated – stopping an ectopic pregnancy from growing with a shot of methotrexate, for example, may no longer be on the table.\n\nInstead, the only option may be what some religious Catholic practitioners recommend: Treat the woman and the fertilized egg as two patients with equal rights, which means that you can’t just remove a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy; you have to cut out a woman’s entire fallopian tube, and let the fertilized egg die as a result.\n\nAccording to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, “In certain cases, such as aggressive uterine cancer or an ectopic pregnancy, it is morally licit to remove the threat to the mother’s life by removing the cancerous uterus, or by removing part or all of the Fallopian tube where the child implanted, even though it is foreseeable that the child will die as an indirect and unintended effect of such surgery.”\n\nWhat is not allowed under this theory of “pro-life” medicine is preserving a woman’s fertility by simply removing the ectopic pregnancy. A pregnant woman diagnosed with, say, cervical cancer may not be allowed a full range of treatments, and may not be allowed to end a pregnancy in order for her cancer to be treated most effectively.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThis isn’t speculation: In 2012, a teenage girl in the Dominican Republic died from leukemia after being denied appropriate treatment because she was pregnant. Even in the US, Catholic hospitals have denied women the most appropriate care, instead compromising their health and risking their lives because they deemed a fetus, even one that was not going to survive, to be just as important – or more important – than the woman carrying it.\n\nPersonhood and other laws that imbue a fertilized egg with the same rights and liberties as a born person would extend these ridiculous and dangerous policies far and wide – and could go further still.\n\nNone of that seems worth a free ride in the HOV lane.", "authors": ["Jill Filipovic"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/04/11/russia-sends-u-s-dire-warning-tiger-woods-future-5-things-podcast/7273782001/", "title": "Russia sends U.S. dire warning, Tiger Woods' future: 5 Things podcast", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Russia warns of 'direct military confrontation' with US\n\nThe war in Ukraine continues.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Monday, the 11th of April 2022. Today, Russia's offensive in Ukraine's east, plus the changing conversation around sex, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nImran Khan has been pushed out of office as Prime Minister of Pakistan. His political opponents ousted him with a no confidence vote yesterday. The new Prime Minister is expected to be Shehbaz Sharif, brother of disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after a parliament vote later today. Incumbent Emmanuel Macron will face far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen in a winner takes all runoff for the French presidency. They both advanced yesterday in the first round of voting. And Scottie Scheffler is the 2022 Masters champion. It was the 25 year old golfer's first major win.\n\n♦\n\nRussia is warning of a direct military confrontation with the United States. Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov told Newsweek that the West is provoking Russia. And he added, \"We warn that such actions are dangerous. They can lead the US and the Russian Federation onto the path of direct military confrontation.\" His comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into a seventh week. The Russian diplomat also told Newsweek that the invasion came because Ukraine would not stop what he called the genocide of Russians, and that the invasion has its roots eight years earlier when an uprising toppled a Ukrainian government with close ties to Moscow and put a pro-West administration in charge. He said that was particularly problematic because the government has sought closer ties with NATO and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's new offensive in Eastern Ukraine could be a decisive chapter in the conflict. Russia has given up most of its military positioning in Northern and Western parts of the country, but looks determined to take control of the mostly Russian speaking Donbas region in the east. Western military analysts though say Russia is focusing on a larger region stretching from Kharkiv in the north, Ukraine's second largest city, to Kherson in the south. Russian forces shelled Kharkiv yesterday and also continued their assault on Mariupol, the Southern coastal city that's seen some of the war's worst and most consistent violence. In Kharkiv, resident Natalia described how she narrowly survived an attack on her residential building.\n\nTaylor Wilson translating for Natalia:\n\n\"I got hit on the head and the shockwave threw me back. The stairs collapsed, the windows and doors were knocked out. Miraculously, I survived.\"\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said yesterday in his nightly address that the coming week would be crucial in the war. He also accused Russia of trying to avoid responsibility for war crimes in Ukraine. Officials in Ukraine and around the west have accused Russia of war crimes for attacks on civilians. Zelenskyy said, \"When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. The day will come when they will have to admit everything except the truth.\"\n\n♦\n\nA Texas district attorney will file a motion today to dismiss a murder charge against a woman who was arrested in the death of an individual by self-induced abortion. 26-year-old Lizelle Herrera was arrested last week, but it's not clear whether she was accused of having a self-induced abortion or whether she helped someone else get an abortion. The Sheriff's Office didn't say which law Herrera was charged under. In Starr County, District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez ruled that under Texas law, Herrera should not be prosecuted. The case comes in the same state where a bill last year banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n♦\n\nTiger Woods returned to the Masters this week. The golf legend's status at the tournament was up in the air until the week of, but he played and made the cut to compete into the weekend. After his comeback, Tiger also announced when we'll be seeing him again, at least once later this summer. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with Golfweek's Adam Woodard about Tiger's future and how he performed this week at Augusta National.\n\nAdam Woodard:\n\nLook, a couple of years ago, when Tiger came back and won for the first time in the Masters in 2019, I kind of learned that you can't doubt this guy. He's always going to be able to have a trick up his sleeve. But then 14 months ago, he has that crash. We're not sure is he ever going to be able to walk again. And then let alone, he comes out here, plays four consecutive rounds, beats about five or six people, makes the cut. I mean, it's truly remarkable. Not enough can be said about what he's able to accomplish this week. He's not going to be happy about the result where he finished, but if anything, it's going to motivate him even more. And then today, he said he's going to play The Open Championship in July. He's going to try and play The PGA Championship in May. I mean, he's back and he's coming back, and he's only going to get better. And this week was a huge step forward for him.\n\nPJ Elliott:\n\nDid he talk about how he felt after four days of playing in the tournament without playing in one since the accident?\n\nAdam Woodard:\n\nTired, exhausted. I mean, his body was broken down. I mean, you could tell he had a hitch in his giddy up the entire second nine when he was walking today. He was telling us the other day that it's going to be a lot of ice baths, a lot of recovery. I mean, and that's a guy who's already had multiple back surgeries. He's had a spinal fusion, let alone the fact that he's got a bunch of rods, screws, and plates holding his ankle and right leg together. And the fact that he was able to walk Augusta National, which is a very hilly terrain, a very hilly course, for four days and then even shoot under par the first day was just truly incredible. But I think when you kind of saw him struggling the last few days, that was all his body fatigue and not being able to clear a few shots. But I mean, if anything, this was a great test for what's to come later this year.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor more, head to golfweek.com.\n\n♦\n\nThe conversation around sex is changing, and there's a new trend on social media around the topic of vanilla sex shaming. Wellness Reporter Jenna Ryu has more.\n\nJenna Ryu:\n\nYeah. So vanilla sex shaming is a trend on TikTok, mostly among younger people, but it's basically ridiculing or mocking people who enjoy conventional sex. So, kind of devoid of kinks and fetishes. Obviously, shaming people of any sort is not acceptable, but experts have said that it's interesting that this trend of vanilla shaming is showing how people are kind of opening up about their views on what healthy sex looks like. So for example, talking about sex has usually been something that's uncomfortable or considered taboo. And when we do talk about it, the only kind of permissible form of sex we talk about is vanilla sex. So kind of seeing people rejecting that with vanilla shaming and instead embracing more unconventional methods like consensual BDSM, swinging with other couples, threesomes, role play, sex toys, et cetera, kind of shows how people are expanding their views on a once taboo topic.\n\nI think a lot of people try to avoid talking about sex, just one, because it can be an uncomfortable and private topic. But also because they assume that if you don't talk about sex, people just won't have sex which isn't true. And experts say that it doesn't stop people from having sex, it stops people from having safe sex. So for example, it doesn't give them the opportunity to openly talk about STD transmission, or for example, how to have of safe sex, pleasurable sex, knowing when you're comfortable, when you're not. So that's why it's important to kind of have these healthy conversations about sex that go beyond this one dimensional view we used to have of what is healthy and what isn't, because the reality is that sex is not a monolith and there's a lot of ways you can have healthy sex even if it's not conventional.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find Jenna's full story in today's episode description.\n\n♦\n\nAn update has arrived for some US passports. Beginning today, US citizens will be able to select the letter X as the gender marker on their passport application instead of M or F. The State Department announced the move last year and added that transgender travelers would no longer have to provide medical certification if their gender identity doesn't line up with the marker on their birth certificate or other documents. A human rights campaign said more than 1.2 million non-binary adults in the US, 2 million transgender people, and 5.5 million people born intersex could be affected by the changes.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

It's also getting rid of its offices tackling HIV and improving minority health.\n\nStaff had to present their badges at the building entrance and those who had been fired were given a ticket and told to return home.\n\nMore than 100,000 federal workers have already lost their jobs in the last two months as part of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to shrink staffing levels in federal departments and agencies. Tens of thousands more are expected as more agencies implement their reduction in force, or RIF, plans in the coming weeks.\n\nCombined with earlier layoffs and people who accepted early retirement offers, the total Health and Human Services workforce is expected to drop from 82,000 to 62,000 people.\n\nFollow along for live updates.\n\nCuts will 'harm' Americans with infectious, chronic diseases, experts say\n\nInfectious disease experts, including those addressing HIV, argued the latest HHS cuts will make the country less safe from infectious and chronic diseases.\n\n“We cannot do the complex and serious work of protecting Americans from infectious diseases amid this chaos and confusion,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.\n\nThe cuts extended to HIV prevention division in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Colleen Kelley, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, explained in a statement. The office evaluated interventions, developed treatment guidelines and targeted resources to those who need it most, said Kelley, a professor at Emory University School of Medicine.\n\n“The randomness of today’s actions is reckless and will harm Americans rather than make them healthy,” she said.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nStories of justice and action across America: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nGOP lawmaker tells fired federal worker 'you probably deserved it'\n\nIt certainly wasn’t the viral moment that Mack Schroder expected during his trip to Capitol Hill.\n\nThe former Health and Human Services employee was among a small group of other fired federal workers protesting Tuesday, when he recorded an interaction with Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., telling him \"Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14th. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what’s happening?\"\n\nBanks replied, \"Uh, you probably deserved it.\" Schroeder asked him why, and the lawmaker replied \"Because you seem like a clown.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Schroeder told USA TODAY that he found Banks' comments shocking.\n\n“It felt very childish to hear someone in a leadership position whose constituents rely on these programs to say that,” Schroeder said. “I hope a lot of people in his state see the callousness that he demonstrated.”\n\nBanks’ office didn’t immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment. However, the senator is using an image from the interaction as a “#NewProfilePic” on his X account.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nNew 'fork in the road' offer for Defense Department employees\n\nCivilian employees at the Defense Department received an email reopening Elon Musk’s “fork in the road” buyout program for employees who opt to resign between April 7 and 14.\n\nAccording to the email, the department will oversee its own deferred resignation program through the deal. Musk offered federal employees who resigned full pay and benefits through the end of September.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the program was aimed at shrinking the Pentagon's civilian workforce.\n\n\"The net effect will be a reduction in the number of civilian full-time equivalent positions and increased resources in the areas where we need them most,\" the memo read, according to a Defense Department statement.\n\nTobacco prevention office takes a hit\n\nThe job cuts at FDA’s tobacco center came as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention made similar cuts to its tobacco control efforts.\n\nCuts to the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health and Global Health Center were “particularly concerning,” said Tom Frieden, who headed the CDC during the Obama administration.\n\nThe CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health aims to prevent tobacco use, especially among kids, Frieden said.\n\n“No other part of the federal government tracks tobacco use, supports comprehensive action at the community level, and counters threats such as new forms of tobacco products,” Frieden said. “Weakening tobacco prevention is a gift to Big Tobacco that would guarantee more addiction, disease, and death.”\n\nMitch Zeller, who headed the FDA’s tobacco center from 2013 to 2022, said firings at the FDA combined with CDC tobacco prevention cuts were alarming.\n\nHe said he doesn’t see a clear strategy in place for how the Trump administration will prevent smoking and tobacco use, which remains the leading cause of preventable death.\n\n“Every new administration should have the opportunity to come and take their time to reassess and figure out what things could be done better,” Zeller said. “But there's been nothing thoughtful about any of this. It's thoughtless.”\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump administration cuts FDA staff handling bird flu outbreaks\n\nThe Trump administration has fired Food and Drug Administration employees responsible for the federal response to the ongoing bird flu outbreaks, according to former staff and professional groups.\n\nOn Tuesday, leadership and administrative staff at the Center for Veterinary Medicine were among about 140 staff members fired as part of a larger \"reduction in force\" in the 700-person agency, according to two sources with first-hand knowledge.\n\nThe center regulates animal drugs, food and medical devices has played a key role in limiting the spread of the virus to protect people, pets and farm animals.\n\nIn response to questions about cuts to FDA, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred to public statements and a fact sheet from the agency and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nTrump views HHS layoffs as way to save taxpayer money: White House\n\nPresident Donald Trump has delegated the authority to hire and fire federal workers to his Cabinet secretaries and views the layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services as part of the strategy to save money for taxpayers, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n“The president has given the responsibility to his Cabinet secretaries to hire and fire at their respective agencies,” Leavitt told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“You saw the secretary of Health and Human Services announced more layoffs today. This is all part of the administration’s effort for a mass reduction in force in the federal bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C., to save American taxpayers money.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMassive NIH gene study program spared most layoffs so far\n\nA novel National Institutes of Health program that has analyzed the genes of about 150,000 volunteers survived the mass Trump administration layoffs on Tuesday, but the 20 people who do public communications for it have been placed on leave as a preliminary step toward being laid off, one official with the program said.\n\nThe federal All of Us Research Program shares the results of volunteers’ genetic analysis – information on things like how they metabolize medication, as well as their risks for certain diseases.\n\nThe communications division for “All of Us” was severely impacted by the reduction in force, with all of its communications staff being put on administrative leave, one NIH official who works on the program told USA TODAY.\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are now looking for work, said the move will undermine the program itself. The official said that is because some of those put on leave worked on the “All of Us” website, outreach to program volunteers and its website and social media accounts.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nAnti-tobacco group slams ouster of FDA center director\n\nAnti-tobacco groups blasted the removal of Brian King, who headed the Food and Drug Administration’s tobacco center since 2022. King was offered a position at Indian Health Services.\n\nThe layoffs at the FDA’s tobacco center are “deeply irresponsible” and will slow efforts to “protect kids and save lives from tobacco use,” said Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-tobacco group.\n\nRichardson said removing FDA center directors “indicates a troubling move away from science-based regulation to protect public health.”\n\nUnder King’s watch, the FDA cracked down on illegal vapes and proposed slashing nicotine levels in cigarettes, most cigars and other tobacco products.\n\n‒ Ken Alltucker\n\nFDA ‘as we’ve known it is finished’: former commissioner\n\nRobert Califf, a former FDA commissioner during the Obama administration, said Tuesday in a post on LinkedIn that the agency “as we’ve known it is finished,” and he predicted the loss of institutional knowledge would be “a huge mistake.”\n\n“OK, i'm on a coast to coast flight, but i'm overwhelmed with messages about the firings,” Califf wrote. “The FDA as we've known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed. I believe that history will see this (as) a huge mistake. I will be glad if I'm proven wrong, but even then there is no good reason to treat people this way. It will be interesting to hear from the new leadership how they plan to put ‘Humpty Dumpty’ back together again.”\n\n‒ Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Democrats launch probe into HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “lackluster response” to bird flu\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday launched an investigation into what they called HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “lackluster response” to the bird flu outbreak.\n\n“We write regarding the widespread outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and your recent comments appearing to minimize the health and economic threat that such outbreaks pose,” the lawmakers, including Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote in a letter to Kennedy. They also requested information about how the Department of Health and Human Services will address the outbreak and associated costs, including coordination plans with other federal agencies.\n\n“Not only has avian influenza infected 70 Americans and killed one, but this pathogen has killed more than 168 million birds since 2022 and is leading to skyrocketing egg prices for consumers as it spreads through poultry and cattle farms,” the lawmakers said.\n\nThe House Democrats questioned Kennedy’s proposal to let avian flu spread in an effort to create “immunity,” saying it contradicts the prevention plans previously announced by other federal agencies under the Trump Administration, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis “strategy” also coincides with the emergence of a new strain of a highly pathogenic bird flu known as H7N9, which surfaced at a poultry farm in Mississippi earlier this month and led to the deaths of 46,000 birds, they said.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nTransportation Department makes buyout offer\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department on Tuesday sent thousands of employees a new buyout offer to leave government service in exchange for pay and benefits through Sept. 30, according to Reuters.\n\nThe offer requires employees to decide by April 7. It exempts public safety positions like Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors as well as railroad safety inspectors, pipeline and hazardous materials safety inspectors and cybersecurity employees.\n\n‒ Reuters\n\nFDA’s chief tobacco regulator is out, amid sweeping cuts at the agency\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration’s chief tobacco regulator has been removed from his position amid deep cuts at the FDA and broader federal health agencies, the New York Times and The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nBrian King, the leader of the FDA’s tobacco division, was offered a job with the Indian Health Service in Alaska on Tuesday morning, “a clear ouster from the Trump administration,” according to the New York Times. It said that under King’s leadership, enforcement efforts ramped up against illicit vapes that appeal to teens and that the rates of e-cigarette use by teens fell consistently.\n\nPresident Trump “has pledged to stand up for people who vape and has accepted at least $8 million in campaign funds in recent years from tobacco companies,” the Times reported.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart and profound disappointment that I share I have been placed on administrative leave,” King said in an email to staff, according to the AP.\n\nDozens of other staffers in FDA’s tobacco center also received notices of dismissal Tuesday morning, including the entire office responsible for enforcing tobacco regulations, the AP said.\n\n‒ Josh Meyer\n\nStates sue over Trump administration attempts to claw back money\n\nA group of Democratic-led states on Tuesday sued Republican President Donald Trump's administration to challenge its cancellation of $11 billion in federal grants allocated to the states during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttorneys general and governors from 23 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island arguing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lacks the authority to unilaterally claw back funding the states had already built health programs around. States are using the grants to track, prevent and control infectious diseases, including measles and bird flu, as well as track mental health services and fund addiction treatment.\n\n– Reuters\n\nUSDA makes early retirement offer\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture is offering employees financial incentives to leave the agency this month, according to a Monday evening email sent to staff, according to Reuters.\n\nEmployees at the USDA who opt in to the Deferred Resignation Program by April 8 would be put on administrative leave with full pay and benefits through September 30, the email stated.\n\nThe agency is also offering early retirement to employees who are at least 50 years old with 20 years of federal service, or any age with 25 years of federal service, according to the email.\n\n– Reuters\n\nWhat do the mass layoffs at HHS mean?\n\nThe targeted federal agencies oversee how the nation pays for health care for older Americans and the poor. They also research infectious diseases and public health threats. The overhaul also will bring changes to the agency that scrutinizes the safety of prescription drugs, food and medical devices.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which oversees prescription drug approvals and medical devices in the United States, will terminate 3,500 full-time employees.\n\nHHS said in a news release that the reductions won't affect drug or medical device approvals, but several experts told USA TODAY that the move will overload employees who survive the cuts leading to slow downs in services.\n\n– Ken Alltucker and Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nHead of vaccine agency resigns\n\nAhead of the layoffs, Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine official at the Food and Drug Administration, resigned. In his resignation, Marks criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has questioned the effectiveness of vaccines for years and promoted debunked claims that certain vaccines are linked to autism.\n\n\"It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCory Booker delivers marathon speech to protests cuts\n\nU.S. Sen. Cory Booker is continuing what he promises to be a marathon speech on the Senate floor. On Monday night Booker took control of Senate floor to criticize actions Trump and Musk have taken in the first months of the administration.

The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/31/election-2024-live-updates-trump-harris-nevada/75943403007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Trump, Harris hold Nevada rallies; latest polls", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the election campaign trail for the 2024 election from Thursday, Oct. 31.

I believe that together we are the difference in this election. I know that together we are the difference in this election.”\n\nThe comments come after former President Donald Trump fell under fire after a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” Although Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, tried to distance himself from the racist joke, he was met with backlash from Puerto Rican and other Latino voters.\n\nLopez criticized the offensive joke, saying “it wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day. It was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nRecord turnout in Georgia? 50% of active voters have cast ballots\n\nAs of Thursday, more than 50% of active Georgia voters – about 3.7 million – have already cast their ballots in the Peach State, according to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office. Thursday was the seventeenth day of early voting, and the office said it expects turnout to increase on Friday, the last early voting day.\n\nThe current tally dwarfs early voting numbers from Day 17 in the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections, which were about 1.5 million, 2.3 million, and 1.9 million respectively, according to a Thursday press release.\n\nThe updated figure marks a continuation of what Raffensperger has described as record-breaking early turnout numbers: \"Georgia voters are smashing through every voting record, with more than 3 million for in-person early voting turnout, which is unprecedented in Georgia history,\" Raffensperger said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\nGabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office, suggested Wednesday that, with early turnout so high, Election Day polling places could be a \"ghost town.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nVance jabs Biden, says he's 'trying to help' Trump win\n\nJD Vance suggested during an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast that Joe Biden is “trying to help” Donald Trump win the election after the president’s “garbage” comments earlier this week. The president appeared to call Trump's supporters \"garbage,\" but he later said he was only talking about a comedian who told insulting jokes at a Trump rally over the weekend.\n\n“After we win, I'm gonna be convinced that Joe Biden was trying to help us the whole time,” Vance said, referencing a moment where Biden jokingly put on a Trump 2024 hat during a visit to Pennsylvania.\n\nEarlier, Vance told Rogan that he’d bet $20 that Biden was planning to vote for Trump and $100 that his son, Hunter Biden, would also back the Republican nominee over Kamala Harris. Biden immediately endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris ponders late mother's advice\n\nVice President Kamala Harris reflected at a stop in Phoenix on Thursday about what her late mother would think of her campaign for president against Donald Trump.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Harris was asked what advice her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would give her in the final days of the days of the campaign.\n\n“Just go beat him. That’s probably what she’d say,” Harris said. Laughing, she added, “Yeah, that’s my mother.”\n\nHarris has credited her mother as a major influence on her life. Shyamala Gopalan, who came alone to the United States from India when she was 19, was a biomedical scientist who wanted to cure breast cancer. She died in 2009.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTrump sues CBS News over '60 Minutes' interview of Harris\n\nTrump has filed a long-shot damages lawsuit against CBS News over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview of Harris.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the network of \"voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.\" Don't expect the lawsuit to go anywhere. Networks routinely edit taped interviews of newsmakers.\n\nIn this case, there was no effort to deceive, CBS said. In an Oct. 20 statement, 60 Minutes said it \"gave an excerpt of our interview to 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGaza protesters interrupt Harris rally in Phoenix\n\nProtesters against the war in the Gaza Strip interrupted Kamala Harris several times Thursday while she was speaking at campaign rally in Phoenix.\n\nA protester started shouting about five minutes into Harris’s speech but was quickly hustled out as the crowd chanted “Kamala.” Over the next few minutes, other protesters began shouting, prompting a response from the vice president.\n\n“Let’s talk for a moment about Gaza,” she said. “We all want this war to end and the hostages home. I will work on it full time when I am elected president, as I’ve been.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nTrump announces he would create new Cabinet post aimed at reducing costs\n\nTrump said at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday that he would create a new Cabinet position aimed at reducing the cost of living if he wins a second term.\n\n“I will create a new Cabinet position for a senior member of my administration who will be tasked exclusively with doing everything in the federal government’s power to reduce the cost of living,” he said.\n\nHe added that on day one of his presidency, he would sign an executive order that would direct every federal agency to remove regulations that are “driving up the cost of goods,” but didn’t provide specific government regulations he'd target.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBasketball legend LeBron James endorses Harris\n\nBasketball superstar LeBron James added his name to the list of celebrities from the sports and entertainment worlds who are endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers legend posted a video Thursday evening on the social media platform X featuring some of the disparaging remarks Harris’s opponent, Republican Donald Trump, has made over the years, including his claim that immigrants “are poisoning the blood of our country” and that the country would be “like Detroit” if Harris wins. The video also shows footage of protesters and Trump saying he’d like to punch them in the face.\n\n“What are we even talking about here??” James wrote on X. “When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nStormy Daniels honored in Salem with witch award\n\nPracticing witches gathered in Salem, Mass. on Thursday to honor adult film actress Stormy Daniels with a new award, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nThe group of witches, who gather in the spooky New England town every Halloween for their annual \"magic circle,\" gave Daniels the first ever \"Salem’s Witches’ Woman of Power Award.\" They said she was the victim of a modern-day witch hunt.\n\nDaniels was at the center of Donald Trump's New York hush money trial earlier this year. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in an effort to hide hush money payments to Daniels, who has alleged that they had an affair.\n\n\"I can't find the words to explain emotionally how big this is to me,\" Daniels told the Globe. \"No one understands what the last six years have been like for me... The persecution those witches felt hundreds of years ago feels very familiar to me.\"\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump aide: RFK Jr. will not be in charge of health agencies\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump “promised” to put him in charge of public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTrump's transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick said Wednesday Kennedy would be in no such position.\n\n“He’s not getting a job for HHS,” Lutnick told CNN.\n\n\"He's not going to be the (HHS) secretary, no,\" he added. \"That's not what he wants to do.”\n\nKennedy, a former 2024 presidential candidate, has earned a reputation for being anti-vaccine and spreading COVID-19 related conspiracy theories. Lutnick said Wednesday that Kennedy's real goal was not a cabinet position, but rather access to data from these agencies in an attempt to paint vaccines as unsafe and take them off the market.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump again claims to be 'father of IVF'\n\nTrump went a little more than 90 minutes Thursday in Nevada, bashing Harris, attacking immigration policy, and - twice - claiming parentage of in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"I feel like I'm the father of IVF,\" Trump said at one point during the rally at Henderson, Nevada, near Las Vegas; a little more than an hour later, he said that \"I'm like the father of IVF.\"\n\nTrump's comments, echoes of a joke he made at a Fox News town hall earlier this month, again drew rebukes from Democrats who say that Republican anti-abortion policies threaten IVF.\n\n\"IVF is under threat across the country because Trump ended Roe v. Wade and his Project 2025 plan could effectively ban IVF altogether,\" said an X post from the Harris campaign rapid response unit.\n\nTrump said Democrats are lying about his support for IVF, and that he wants the government or insurance companies to cover the costs of IVF treatments.\n\n- David Jackson\n\n‘Stay tuned’: Undated absentee ballots in Pennsylvania remain center of court fight\n\nA Pennsylvania court ruled that absentee ballots in Philadelphia with missing or incorrect dates should be counted in the Nov. 5 election despite a prohibition in state law, but advocates are waiting for the final word on the dispute from the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe stakes are potentially significant in the key swing state because 2.1 million requests for absentee ballots were approved and nearly 1.5 million have been returned through Wednesday, according to state Secretary of State Al Schmidt.\n\nThe portion with missing or wrong dates won't be known until the ballots are processed, but advocates say mistakes are decreasing as problems with the ballots are publicized.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nVance says he went home to 'load all my guns' after Trump was shot\n\nWhen Donald Trump was shot in the ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, JD Vance, his soon-to-be running mate, was mini-golfing with his family in Cincinnati. Vance told the story on Joe Rogan's podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" on Thursday.\n\n\"I actually thought they had killed him because when you first see the video he grabs his ear and then he goes down,\" Vance recalled after seeing the video of Trump's July 13 rally. \"I'm like, 'Oh my God, they just killed him.'\"\n\nAfter seeing the video, the Ohio senator said he brought his family back to their Cincinnati home and grabbed his guns.\n\n\"At first I was so pissed, but then I go into like fight or flight mode with my kids... We were at a mini golf place in Cincinnati, Ohio. I grab my kids up, throw them in the car, go home and load all my guns. And basically stand like a sentry in our front door, and that was my reaction to it,\" he said.\n\n– Victoria Moorwood\n\nHarris to spend election night at Howard University, her alma mater\n\nKamala Harris will spend election night at her alma mater Howard University, the campaign said Thursday.\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee, graduated from Howard, an HBCU in Washington, in 1986. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first Black sorority.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump will have an election night watch party at a convention center in West Palm Beach, Florida, his campaign has said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nCardi B to speak at Harris campaign concert event in Milwaukee\n\nInternational star and rapper Cardi B will campaign for the Harris-Walz ticket Friday in the battleground state of Wisconsin, the campaign announced Thursday.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign will hold a concert event, \"When We Vote We Win,\" in Milwaukee and Cardi B, along with other popular artists Flo Milli, GloRilla, MC Lyte, DJ Gemini Gilly and the Isley Brothers will perform.\n\nIn 2023, Cardi B said in an Instagram Live that she would not be endorsing in the 2024 presidential election after she openly supported President Joe Biden in 2020, citing concerns with spending in foreign conflicts.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nTrump asks voters whether they prefer to be called Hispanic or Latino at New Mexico rally\n\nDonald Trump during a campaign rally in New Mexico asked attendees whether they prefer to be called \"Hispanics\" or \"Latinos\"? The crowd cheered louder for \"Hispanic.\"\n\n\"First of all, Hispanics love Trump.\" the candidate said. \"I like them. They're smart.\"\n\nThe moment came as Trump has faced days of backlash over insulting jokes a comedian made about Puerto Ricans and other Latino people at his Sunday rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nKerry Washington, Bon Jovi to headline Kamala Harris campaign rally in North Carolina\n\nActress Kerry Washington and musician Jon Bon Jovi set to headline a Harris campaign rally Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina, three days before Election Day.\n\nWashington, star of the television series “Scandal,” will speak at the rally, dubbed “When we vote we win,” while Bon Jovi is among a slate of musical acts that also includes Brittney Spencer, Khalid and The War and Treaty.\n\nWashington made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention in August, and Bon Jovi has also endorsed the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe Harris campaign has worked to move North Carolina, which has 16 electoral votes up for grabs, back to the Democratic column for the first time since Barack Obama carried the state in 2008.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump visits New Mexico − a long shot state\n\nTrump began a western swing Thursday in a state that is more of a long shot than a battleground: New Mexico. At the start of an airport rally in Albuquerque, Trump said advisers told him \"you can't win New Mexico,\" but he disagreed.\n\n\"We can win New Mexico,\" Trump said; he acknowledged he lost the state in both of his previous elections, but claimed without evidence that those votes were \"rigged.\"\n\nPollsters don't give Trump much of a chance in the Land of Enchantment. Real Clear Politics' average of New Mexico polls has Harris with a solid lead over Trump, 49.7% to 42.3%. New Mexico has only 5 electoral votes, but that could be enough to decide a close election.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nJake Paul tells supporters to vote for Trump, even though he can't\n\nBoxer and controversial media figure Jake Paul urged his 80 million YouTube subscribers to vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a video on Thursday despite not being able to vote himself.\n\nThe 27-year-old former Disney Channel star, who now resides in Puerto Rico and cannot participate in presidential elections, told his audience the offensive \"floating island of garbage\" joke made Sunday at a Trump rally was not reflective of the former president's views and that shouldn't stop people from voting for him.\n\n\"Please, for the love of God, go, exercise your right to vote on my behalf and vote for Donald Trump in this election,\" Paul said in the 18-minute-long video also posted to his 4 million X followers. \"America depends on it.\"\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nGOP backlash after Mark Cuban says Trump is 'never' around 'strong, intelligent women'\n\nBillionaire and Harris-Walz campaign surrogate Mark Cuban told 'The View' on Thursday morning that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is intimidated by \"strong, intelligent women,\" saying that's why he has a soured relationship with former GOP candidate Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women, ever,\" Cuban said. \"He doesn't like to be challenged by them, and, you know (Haley) will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can't have her around, it wouldn't work.\"\n\nCuban's comments quickly garnered backlash from Republicans, claiming they were rooted in misogyny and divisive politics.\n\n\"@mcuban this is extremely insulting to the thousands of women who work for President Trump, and the tens of millions of women who are proudly voting for him. These women are mothers, entrepreneurs, and industry leaders. And yes, we are strong AND intelligent! #WomenForTrump,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign national press secretary said on X Thursday.\n\n- Sam Woodward\n\nDodgers (and Chiefs) win 2024 sports titles: Good omens for Harris?\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers became baseball champions Wednesday night by wrapping up the World Series - and some sports astrologists think that's a good omen for California native Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter all, the Dodgers last won the World Series in 2020, days before Donald Trump lost that year's presidential election. But wait sports fans: There's more.\n\nIn February, the Kansas City Chiefs won football's Super Bowl - just like they did in 2020.\n\nDemocratic strategist Ally Sammarco on the X social media site put it this way:\n\n\"2020: Chiefs win the Super Bowl ... Dodgers win the World Series ... Donald Trump loses the election\n\n2024: Chiefs win the Super Bowl ... Dodgers win the World Series ... ????\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nCo-conspirator in Trump Georgia 2020 election interference case has law license suspended\n\nA New York court suspended Kenneth Chesebro's law license on Thursday based on his guilty plea in former President Donald Trump's Georgia criminal case. Chesebro pleaded guilty in 2023 to a single felony, conspiring to file false documents, as part of a deal that requires him to do community service and testify against other defendants.\n\nNineteen defendants, including Trump, were originally charged in the sweeping indictment brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Chesebro is one of four to plead guilty so far.\n\nProsecutors alleged Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and elsewhere to help people pose as presidential electors in an effort to reverse President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nIn trying to protect his New York law license, Chesebro argued that the outcome in his Georgia case isn't yet final. He cited the Georgia judge overseeing his case, who said that under the state's First Offender Act Chesebro will be \"completely exonerated of guilt\" once he completes his five-year probation sentence.\n\nBut a group of five New York judges rejected that argument.\n\n\"In our view, it is of no moment that respondent may ultimately be 'exonerated' under Georgia law, as it (is just) as plausible that he may violate the terms of his probation and be subjected to additional criminal penalties as a result,\" they wrote.\n\nThe suspension isn't necessarily permanent. The judges directed Chesebro to make his case down the line for why they shouldn't enter a final order of suspension.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWaiting on Pennsylvania Supreme Court for status of undated absentee ballots\n\nAbsentee ballots that are undated or have incorrect dates will be counted in Philadelphia, under a state court decision Wednesday. But Republicans are expected to appeal the ruling and advocates are waiting to see what the state Supreme Court will do.\n\nThe case at stake involved 69 ballots with missing or incorrect dates from a September special election for state House seats. Judge Ellen Ceisler wrote for the 3-2 majority the ballots should be counted despite “meaningless dating provisions” in state law.\n\nBut Judge Matthew Wolf, who disagreed with the ruling, wrote that the decision risked causing confusion on the eve of the general election.\n\nThe Republican National Committee is expected to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case because the high court already ruled in September that undated ballots should not be counted.\n\nMarian Schneider, senior policy counsel for voting rights at the ACLU in Pennsylvania, said election officials in Philadelphia, which was a party to the lawsuit, expect to count absentee ballots on Election Day despite missing or incorrect dates unless the high court acts. She said the dispute could be resolved after the election.\n\n“Stay tuned,” Schneider said. “I do not expect this to be the last word on this issue. To the extent that it’s not resolved before the election, there will probably be proceedings after the election with regard to specific provisional ballots.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nNew polls: Harris and Trump essentially tied in Georgia and North Carolina\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are in a dead heat in both Georgia and North Carolina with Election Day closing in on Tuesday, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe polls found that 47% of likely voters in Georgia support Harris, while 48% back Trump. Forty-eight percent of likely voters in North Carolina support Harris, while 47% support Trump.\n\nThe poll was conducted between Oct. 23 and Oct. 28 among 732 registered voters in Georgia and 750 registered voters in North Carolina. Both candidates were within the margins of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\n‘Get pissed off’: Vance makes closing argument to young voters\n\nAt a town hall in North Carolina, Vance offered the crowd of High Point University students this closing message: “You should be pissed off.”\n\n“And why should you be pissed off?” Vance said. “You should be pissed off because you’re the first generation in the history of the United States of America that is unlikely to be able to own a home, that is unlikely to be able to earn a wage on which you can raise a family, that is more likely to be indebted than you are to accumulate wealth.”\n\nThe Republican vice presidential candidate focused on the economy, including high costs of living and college tuition debt, in his address to students Thursday morning. Vance also fielded questions from the young voters related to immigration and public safety.\n\n“We can make a different policy choice, but only if you guys get pissed off about the position you’ve been put in and vote for a change in leadership,” Vance said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWalz attempts to court male voters in Pennsylvania amid notable gender gap\n\nAt a campaign rally in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, Walz directly called out undecided male voters in his speech asking them to “think about the women in your lives you love.”\n\n“This election literally is about their lives,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. “Their lives are at stake in this election.”\n\nWalz’s comments come as the Harris campaign is trying to address a notable gender gap. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that women decisively Harris, 53% to 36%, while men overwhelmingly support Trump, 53% to 37%.\n\nThe Minnesota governor also criticized comments Trump made at a rally in Wisconsin last night where the former president vowed to protect women “whether the women like it or not.”\n\n“We trust women to make their own decisions. We trust them to go to their doctors. We trust them to make these types of decisions,” said Walz.\n\n“Here's what's going to happen on Tuesday. They are going to send a loud and clear message to Donald Trump on Nov. 5. They're going to send that message whether he likes it or not,” Walz added in his speech.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris: ‘Very offensive to women’ that Trump said he would protect women whether they ‘like or not’\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told reporters Thursday that Donald Trump’s vow to protect women “whether the women like it or not” was a “very offensive” statement.\n\n“It actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,” Harris told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe Harris campaign has capitalized on Trump’s comments, releasing an ad hours after Trump made those remarks on Wednesday.\n\nTrump during his rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday said that he wants to protect women, something he said his advisors urged him to not say.\n\n“I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not,” Trump said. “I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles.”\n\nHarris also said Trump will repeal the Affordable Care Act, pointing to comments House Speaker Mike Johnson made this week where he said there will be \"no Obamacare\" if Trump and congressional Republicans win the upcoming election on Nov. 5. Trump during this election cycle has vowed to improve upon the ACA but avoided proposing any specific policies.\n\n“He is not going to be fighting for women's reproductive rights,” Harris concluded. “He does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and health care for all Americans is on the line in this election as well.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nJosh Shapiro rebuts Trump, promises secure Pennsylvania election\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro promised a free and fair election after Donald Trump amplified claims of voter fraud in the state.\n\n\"They've already started cheating,\" Trump told the crowd at a rally in Allenstown Tuesday.\n\nOn social media this week, the GOP nominee continued laying the groundwork to claim voter fraud following the election.\n\n\"We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania. Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW!\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?\"\n\nThe state has asked for patience as investigations into thousands of potentially fraudulent voter registration applications filed in Lancaster and possibly other counties continue. Shapiro responded to Trump's claims in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday.\n\n\"Let’s remember, in 2020, Donald Trump attacked our elections over and over,\" Shapiro wrote. \"He's now trying to use the same playbook to stoke chaos, but hear me on this: we will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election — and the will of the people will be respected.\"\n\n- Sarah Wire and Rachel Barber\n\n‘Fingers crossed’: Viktor Orbán wishes Trump good luck for Election Day\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday that he spoke with Trump over the phone and wished him “the best of luck for next Tuesday.”\n\n“Only five days to go. Fingers crossed,” he wrote in the post.\n\nOrbán is a hard-right politician who has drawn controversy for his efforts to limit press freedom and political opposition. Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Orbán, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China at campaign rallies.\n\nHarris has previously knocked Trump for openly admiring these leaders and cast the former president as a threat to democracy.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Kinsey Crowley\n\nTrump and Harris in dead heat in crucial swing state\n\nTrump and Harris are neck and neck in Michigan, a key swing state, less than a week out from the Nov. 5 election, according to a new Washington Post poll released Thursday.\n\nThe poll found that 47% of likely voters would back Harris while 46% would back Trump. Among registered voters, 47% said they would back Trump while 45% said they would back Harris.\n\nSix percent of voters in both groups said they had no opinion or skipped answering who they would vote for.\n\nThe poll, conducted between Oct. 24 and Oct. 28 among 1,003 registered and likely voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump vows to \"protect women,\" Harris responds to the comment\n\nTrump told a crowd in Wisconsin Wednesday he would protect women – “whether the women like it or not.”\n\nCampaign advisers to the former president had urged him to not to say that, he said.\n\n“I want to protect the people, I want to protect of our country. I want to protect the women. 'Sir, please don’t say that.’ Why? They said, ‘We think it’s very inappropriate,’” Trump said.\n\n“Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them,” he added. “I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles.”\n\nThe Harris campaign jumped on the statement, releasing an ad hours later using clips of Trump’s comment side-by-side with headlines related to reproductive rights.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court judges that helped overturned Roe v. Wade. In turn, Trump has boasted about his role in upending a constitutional abortion right and returning limit decisions to the states.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nAmericans are anxious and frustrated about the 2024 campaigns\n\nMost Americans reported feeling anxious or frustrated about the presidential election in a new poll by The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released Thursday.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are similarly frustrated by the campaigns, but more Democrats reported feeling anxious about the race. The poll found 79% of Democrats said they were anxious compared to 66% of Republicans.\n\nA majority of Americans are not excited about the presidential contest. Only 24% of independents, 37% of Democrats, and 41% of Republicans said they feel excited about the election.\n\nThe survey of 1,233 Americans had a +/- 3.6 percentage point margin of error.\n\n-- Rachel Barber\n\nNFL owners' political donations surge to $28 million, lean Republican\n\nNFL owners have donated at least $28 million to federal political candidates and causes during the 2023-24 election cycle − a hefty sum that, according to USA TODAY Sports research, marks a sevenfold increase from the amount spent over the same time period four years ago.\n\nThe significant increase in owners' political giving can be attributed in large part − though not exclusively − to the addition of the Walton-Penner ownership group, which purchased the Denver Broncos in 2022.\n\nAtlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($3.3 million), Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper ($2.9 million) and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson ($1.8 million) are among the other NFL leaders who have eclipsed seven figures in donations.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy wrote in an email that \"it is up to club personnel to determine to which candidates and causes they will contribute.\"\n\n-- Tom Schad and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris campaign seeks to shore up support from Puerto Rican, Latino voters\n\nThe Harris campaign released a new ad Thursday aimed at targeting Puerto Rican and Latino voters in key battleground states just a few days out from the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe new Spanish-language ad, titled Somos Más, takes a direct hit at comments that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made at Trump’s Madison Square Rally on Sunday, where he called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”\n\n“Puerto Rico is an island of scientists, poets, educators, stars and heroes. ¡Boricua! We're not trash, we're more,” the narrator in the ad says.\n\nA press release from the campaign notes that the ad will air on Spanish language TV, including Univision, Telemundo and WAPA America, as well as social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube to reach voters.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow ballot counting will be protected on election night and beyond\n\nMore than a dozen county and city election officials spoke with USA TODAY about what they are doing to make sure they can count ballots at central ballot counting locations once polls close, no matter what happens outside.\n\nElection officials have built new warehouses where ballots will be counted under increased security. Local and state law enforcement have run through multiple scenarios for large crowds descending on the ballot counting locations.\n\nSome jurisdictions have reduced the number of observers allowed to attend and required them to obtain credentials far in advance.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Koch\n\nWho is ahead in the polls?\n\nIn the final days of the election, battleground states like Pennsylvania remain tightly-contested for Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump and could represent the key to an Electoral College victory.\n\nTwo recent polls show just how close the race is in Pennsylvania, which is among seven swing states that could determine a victory in the race for the White House. A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that in Pennsylvania, the race is tied, while a new poll from Quinnipiac University gave Trump a 1-point edge on Harris.\n\nNationwide, Trump and Harris are tied at 48% in the latest TIPP Tracking Poll.\n\nAs the nail-biter of a race approaches its conclusion in five days, Trump and Harris plan to both address supporters Thursday in Nevada, another key swing state.\n\n--Eric Lagatta\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger endorses Harris\n\nFormer California Republican Gov.

The White House listed Taiwan as a country, which it's not.\n\nChinese goods were already subject to a 20% levy at the U.S. border. Trump imposed an additional 34% tariff on Beijing on Wednesday − taking the total to 54% − as part of his program of \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeted at nations he says have been unfair to the U.S. The higher amount takes effect on April 9.\n\nLive updates Stocks crater as nations vow to retaliate against Trump's tariffs\n\nChina urged Washington to reconsider. It also vowed to retaliate if it didn't. Its commerce ministry called for Washington to \"immediately cancel\" the tariffs, saying they \"endanger global economic development.\"\n\n'Let down by our oldest ally': World leaders react to Trump's sweeping global tariffs\n\nBut listing Taiwan as a country on the tariff board Trump hoisted is a different kind of sting, and geopolitically awkward, because China's government claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. It views the island as a breakaway province. For decades, it's vowed to unite Taiwan politically with Beijing.\n\nToday, Taiwan is recognized as a sovereign and independent country by just 13 out of 193 United Nations member countries. The U.S. isn't one of them. Taiwan cannot join international organizations such as the United Nations, or its specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization.\n\nBeijing has claimed democratic Taiwan as part of its territory since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists lost to Mao Zedong’s Communists and rebased their government in Taiwan. China has not dropped the threat of force to unite the two sides. In recent years it's flown military planes over a corner of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone almost daily to signal its resolve.\n\nTaiwanese officials on Thursday didn't appear to know what to make of Taiwan being designated a country.\n\n\"The partnership between Taiwan and the U.S. is strong,\" Taiwan's office to the European Union and Belgium told Euractiv, a website that focuses on EU-related news and analysis. \"As for the naming, there are several possible reasons and we are not in the position to speculate about this.\"\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut China's ambassador to the U.S. did have something to say about it.\n\n\"Taiwan is China’s Taiwan,\" Ambassador Xie Feng wrote on X, shortly after Trump spoke about the tariffs. \"We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never allow any room for 'Taiwan independence' forces in whatever form.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's new tariffs also targeted a handful of remote Australian territories.\n\nPenguins and seals: remote islands hit with Trump tariffs\n\nOne of them, the Heard and McDonald Islands, have not been visited by humans in more than a decade, according to the BBC, the British broadcaster.

The game is available Oct. 16 for $99.99, and works with both the standard Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite.\n\nNintendo provided USA TODAY a sneak peek at Mario Kart Live, highlighting how the game will work, what's included and much more.\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nUpgrading to PS5 or Xbox Series X?: What to do with your old video game console\n\nWhat does Mario Kart Live include in the box?\n\nIt includes a kart with either Mario or Luigi as the driver, four gates, two arrow signs to help guide drivers on the track, and a USB-C cable to recharge the kart.\n\nHow easy is it to set up?\n\nThe software for the game is available through an online download on Nintendo's eShop. Players will take a QR code from the screen and capture it using the physical kart's camera to pair the kart with the Switch. Players then fold out the gates and place them where they choose.\n\nHow much space do I need?\n\nMario Kart breaks out into four speeds, from slowest to fastest: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and 200cc. For a 150cc race, players should carve out a 10 x 12 foot space for the course, says Nintendo. Slower speeds favor smaller tracks.\n\nHow's the battery life for the kart?\n\nNintendo says for 150cc racing, the kart can go 90 minutes on one charge. A drop in speed, or a bump up, can extend or shorten the battery life respectively.\n\nWhat kind of races can I enter?\n\nThere's a main Grand Prix mode, which is modeled off the variety of courses from previous Mario Kart games. There are also Time Trials where you try to complete a race in the fastest time, and multiplayer where each player with their own Switch and kart race each other.\n\nWhat are the races like?\n\nPlayers will see environmental effects like driving underwater or in the rain immediately impact the physical kart. Gates can be customized to add effects such as boosts, item boxes to pick up tools like banana peels, or obstacles including Piranha Plants that pluck Mario or Luigi from their vehicle.\n\nThe in-game effects impact the physical kart, too. If Mario gets pulled from the vehicle, the kart stops. If there's a sandstorm, the kart will veer left or right.\n\nThere are also augmented reality obstacles like lava on the course that players must drive around. Players can also add their own physical barriers to add creativity to the course.\n\nAfter races, players will earn coins they can use to unlock items within the game.\n\nUltimately, what will potentially make racing in Mario Kart Live fun is the imagination players use in crafting their courses.

Follow Technobubble poobah Jason Hidalgo’s shenanigans on Twitter @jasonhidalgo\n\nI am an unabashed product of pixel-based gaming. As someone who grew up during the heydays of Atari, Nintendo and Sega, my gaming experiences were shaped and formed by a veritable parade of games that were painstakingly put together pixel by pixel.\n\nIn fact, the gradual fall of hand-drawn games following the rise of 3D gaming was akin to a dark period for yours truly. I still remember desperately clutching onto games like Astal, Guardian Heroes and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which were veritable 2D stragglers amid a wave of new 3D games such as Tomb Raider and Tekken that started to define the future of gaming at the time. Being a fan of the exciting new world of 3D as well, I remember thinking to myself, “Why can’t we have both?”\n\nI find it interesting then that the rise of indie gaming has made retro-style games kind of like the craft beer of the video game world. All of a sudden, pixel-based games are cool once again. Shovel Knight, for example, showed that old-school graphics married to excellent gameplay still has a place in today’s gaming industry. Now we have Owlboy swooping in on the PC, a game that surprisingly manages to hit all the right notes as far as what a great game should be. Owlboy is not a game that’s simply content to bank on nostalgia. It’s a game that seriously tries to make a case that it can hang with the best of games out there, regardless of whether they’re built with pixels or polygons.\n\nIt starts with a compelling story. There’s a reason, for example, that the Ninja Gaiden series for the NES is my favorite of all time. While many of the best classics from that era served up awesome gameplay, story was usually an afterthought. Ninja Gaiden’s cut scenes may look rudimentary now but they were revolutionary at the time. As someone who loves to write, it showed me that videogames can be a great storytelling device, too. To its credit, Owlboy recognizes the importance of storytelling regardless of the medium. In doing so, it serves up a story that’s charming, heartbreaking and very much engaging at the same time.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNight and day: Pokemon Sun and Moon review | Technobubble\n\nKaio-ken times two: Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 review | Technobubble\n\nMissing Link: Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas review | Technobubble\n\nIn Owlboy, you play protagonist Otus, a young mute who’s training to be the next in a long line of owl protectors. Unlike the stars of many a video game adventure, Otus is not your brash, courageous protagonist brimming with powerful potential. Instead, he’s a flawed character who lacks the strength and confidence that his kind typically possesses. While he does have courage, there are also times when gets overwhelmed by fear and is practically paralyzed by it. Add a complex formed from all the bullying he has experienced as a mute and you have a protagonist that’s about as imperfect as you can get. Despite all his faults, which also includes an inability to damage foes, what Otus does possess is kindness. That kindness serves as his greatest strength allowing him to form friendships and relationships that help define who he is as well as the Owlboy game as a whole. It is also what ultimately pushes him to do heroic deeds even if his heart doesn’t necessarily have the courage to do so. In the end, weak and fragile Otus proves to be a much better owl than even his powerful, legendary ancestors of old, whose strength and power ironically end up making them more flawed than Otus.\n\nOne way that Otus compensates for his lack of battle prowess is through a reliable group of friends, who lend him strength literally and figuratively when he carries them. There’s best friend Geddy, a gearhead who’s physically even weaker than Otus but makes up for it with his gun. Eventually, your ragtag crew expands as you gain the friendship of other characters, each with their own skills and interesting personalities to add to the mix. I won’t name them to avoid spoilers but one, for example, specializes in heavy, burning damage while the other can send Otus hurtling across the screen to avoid damage. It’s almost akin to a Mega Man mechanic except you carry your “power-ups” around with you.\n\nThe gameplay, which is typically the hallmark of pixel-based classics, certainly does not disappoint, providing a nice mix of action, platforming, puzzle solving and even stealth. It doesn’t get quite as hard as some of the 8-bit and 16-bit classics I’ve played in my youth but it manages to strike a balance between not being too easy while still providing a good amount of challenge so the game does not get boring. This mix of tried-and-true mechanics done right makes the game engaging as you find yourself switching between employing your twitch skills to putting on your thinking cap in order to progress. The game also adds collectibles to hunt for via hidden coins that can be used at the Buccanery to receive upgrades that range from the cosmetic to the useful, including life bar upgrades. Add natural progression to its solid storytelling and you have incentive to continue soldiering on with Otus’ quest.\n\nThe visuals, meanwhile, represent pixel art design at its best. From the moving blades of grass to the impressive pirate ships and large bosses, Owlboy takes the best parts of retro gaming and puts them in full display for a new generation as well as older gamers who remember the good, old days of gaming. There was a time when pixel art was considered dated and limiting. Games such as Owlboy, however, show that pixel art is, well, art. It’s a look that’s both impressive and charming, adding a warmth that you sometimes don’t get from 3D. That charm extends to the characters as well. As someone who dropped poor Geddy more times than I can count, I just about busted a gut when one of your pals tries to assure a certain character that you won’t ever drop her. Your pal then seeks confirmation from Geddy, who says yes with just about as much confidence as a 99-pound guy in a weightlifting contest. These are the little touches that make Owlboy such a joy to play.\n\nOf course, as much as I loved Owlboy, it is not without issues. The controls can be handful at times, requiring deft character switching as well as twin-stick shooting, which can take a while to get used to. The game also has sequences where a single mistake or failure can lead to death whether it be by discovery or damage, which is par for the course of old-school gaming veterans but might frustrate some players who find themselves repeating certain sequences over and over. Some cutscenes also can’t be skipped, which can be frustrating when redoing a certain fight or sequence that comes after it. My biggest gripe, though, would be how the game resolves your struggle with Owlboy's main antagonist, which felt lacking.\n\nThen again, those issues are minor for a game that does so many things right. It’s essentially that rare title that makes you realize you’re playing something special as you go through the game. All in all, Owlboy is a perfect example that shows excellent gameplay design, regardless of the tools you use, is timeless.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nDon’t let its old-school look fool you. Owlboy is a game that is excellent regardless of the time period thanks to great gameplay, a compelling story and characters that will make you care. Add pixel art that is both visually stunning and emotionally touching and you have a game that will definitely fly with both younger gamers and folks like me who who grew up during the heyday of 8-bit and 16-bit gaming. Many times, I feel a sense of relief after finishing a game. In the case of Owlboy, I was sad to see it end because it was such a bonafide hoot to play.\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5\n\n4.5 out of 5 Cost: $24.99, PC\n\n$24.99, PC http://www.owlboygame.com\n\nThe Game Vault: Technobubble Video Game Reviews", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2015/08/24/entertech-old-devices-hold-little-significance-duh/32304901/", "title": "EnterTech: Old devices hold little significance — duh", "text": "Mitch LeClair\n\nmleclair2@stcloud.gannett.com\n\nNostalgia is powerful, but it has limitations.\n\nThe idea I developed for this column (my first in a few weeks; apologies for my absences, dear readers) was to talk about how electronic devices and Web services I used as a kid greatly affected my life.\n\nThen I realized the effects were minute.\n\nMy original Game Boy, first MP3 player and time spent with instant messaging platforms in the past have little significance to my career, mental state or development as a curious human. Each one brought me joy, frustrations and new knowledge. But in the giant scheme of a lifetime, they’re barely meaningful.\n\nThey’re not inconsequential, however — simply pieces of a large puzzle I’ll never fully solve. We all serve as hosts for the riddle: “How will this particular product or service shape my future?” My view is “barely at all, and that’s the fun of it.”\n\nInstead of bringing me despair, this epiphany inspired some unsolicited advice: Keep quantities and context in mind, and you’ll be just fine. (This applies to kiddos, too, so parents, pay attention.)\n\nGrowing up, my two older brothers and I never owned home video game consoles, but we did have two Game Boys and a Sega Game Gear (“Ecco the Dolphin” FTW). We must have played them for hundreds of hours on a family vacation to Oregon in the early 1990s, but the only memory I have of the handheld devices was dropping mine down a flight of concrete stairs. Museum exhibits, a lost sandal in the Pacific Ocean and other nondigital aspects of the trip stuck with, affected and ultimately shaped me more than all the 8-bit victories and defeats made visible through that small, yellow-green Game Boy screen.\n\nPerhaps the electronic displays hanging in vehicles on modern highways will affect backseat riders in a similar way. Or I could be wrong, and they are glowing signals of the continued deprecation of our oh-so-authentic American culture. Time will tell.\n\nA little later in life, around seventh grade, I bought a Rio PMP300, one of the first portable players of MP3 music files. It had a massive 32 megabytes of internal memory — enough for about eight full-quality songs. Upon starting the device for the first time in a decade the other day, I discovered one song was encoded at 64 kilobits per second. That audio quality is comparable to the ear-filling mud that used to seep from rotary telephones (OK, maybe not that bad), yet it was acceptable at the time. Basically, I liked crap.\n\nBut the next song still on the device is “Souljacker Pt. 1” by Eels — a tune I’ll defend till my death as being fun as heck and probably more powerful on its own than the other seven tracks on the device, the PMP300 itself and all the disgusting lyrics from Eminem songs that pulsed into my teenage brain put together.\n\nI repeat: Perspective is key. Focus solely on a particular good or bad aspect of a piece of entertainment technology, and you’re only viewing one point in a million-megapixel landscape (yes, that’s a trillion dots).\n\nThe world of digital amusement is incredibly complex, as is the reality that surrounds you. Remember that the next time someone tells you a device, website or app will change your life.\n\nUnless addiction, dependency or some other mental problem is a factor, I suggest smiling and replying, “Yeah, maybe a little.”\n\nThis is the opinion of Mitch LeClair.

Not all offer much of a steal.\n\nMany are in the $10-$20 off category, or closeouts on older merchandise. But if you're keen on substantial discounts for the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy smartphones, video-game consoles from Microsoft and Sony, a 50-inch 4K TV set or connected speakers from Amazon and Google, get your wallets ready.\n\nThe big box retailers, Target, Walmart and Best Buy, have revealed their \"doorbuster,\" promotions, designed to get massive crowds in the stores and online Thanksgiving evening and Friday, in pursuit of the handful of items offered at the lower prices. But unlike years past, many of the offers are available online as well, before the physical stores open.\n\n\"I tell people to put your stuff in the shopping cart online, and then hit the switch to pay once the sale starts,\" says Melissa Martin of the Blackfriday.com shopping site.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWe looked through ads. Here's where the discounts are meaningful.\n\n—Connected speakers: One of the hottest categories in tech is the voice-activated speaker, both from Amazon and Google, which is practically giving away the new Google Home Mini. It normally sells for $49.99, but Target, Best Buy and Walmart are selling it for $29. Walmart has a $25 gift card that effectively brings the price down to $4, while Target and Best Buy have a $10 gift card. Walmart also has the larger Google Home speaker (normally $129) for $79, with a $25 gift card.\n\n—Smartphones: The Apple iPhone is rarely, if ever discounted, but the big three retailers all have Black Friday specials, with Walmart's more generous than the others, offering a $300 gift card for purchasers of the new iPhone X ($999), 8 and 8 Plus, 7 and 7 Plus with a two-year leasing deal.\n\nTarget and Best Buy's deal is for the new 8 and 8 Plus only, with a $250 and $200 gift card, respectively. Walmart and Target say for this deal, you'll need to come into the store to complete and activate it, but Best Buy will allow for online shopping. For Android fans, Best Buy and Walmart both have the $300 gift card offer for the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+ and Note8 phones.\n\n—TVs. The best deal we've seen to date is Best Buy's in-store-only \"doorbuster\" — a 50- inch 4K TV with built-in Roku streaming from Sharp for $179.99. Most TVs in that class are $300-$500, and a few years ago, were near $1,000. Target has a similar TV from TCL for $349, but that's only $30 less usually marked.\n\n—Videogame consoles. The Microsoft Xbox One S unit and Sony PlayStation 4 units are both $100 off at Target and Walmart. Both are selling Xbox for $189.99, but Target is throwing in a $25 gift card as well.\n\nWhen it starts\n\nThe online sales for Target, Best Buy,, Amazon and Walmart start early Thursday morning; the companies won't offer specific opening times.\n\nThe Best Buy physical stores open at 5 p.m. on Thursday, 6 p.m. for Target and Walmart.\n\nAmazon opened a Black Friday \"store\" on its website November 1, but like the big box stores, it's reserved major deals beginning for the holiday. The best ones are for Amazon products, like the Echo (which was $149, then lowered to $99 this year) available for $79 or the smaller Dot, normally $49.99, now $29.99.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon says it will post a \"Deal of the Day\" at midnight on each day, while several limited \"Lightning\" Deals will be posted throughout the day for a specific period of time.\n\nAccording to Adobe Analytics, which tracks shopping habits, some $5 billion is expected to be spent online on Black Friday, up 16.4% from 2016. The \"Cyber Monday\" sales day, which follows Black Friday, is expected to become the largest online shopping day in history, with $6.6 billion in online sales, up 16.5% from last year, according to Adobe.\n\nAdobe says the most purchased gifts include Hasbro NERF guns, Apple AirPods bluetooth earbuds and the videogame consoles Nintendo Switch and Sony Playstation VR.\n\nThe retailers say they will reveal more deals next week. \"We tell people to be attentive early in the week, because the majority of the new deals will be announced by Wednesday,\" says Lindsay Sakraida of the Dealnews.com website.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2020/11/06/kohls-black-friday-sales-2020-deals-coupons-kitchenaid-mixer/6179090002/", "title": "Kohl's Black Friday Week deals revealed: Sale starts earlier with ...", "text": "Mark the calendar and grab your wallet, the holidays have arrived at Kohl's.

The console is expected to launch this holiday season.\n\nSony did not reveal details on pricing, or even a peek at what the new hardware will look like.\n\nThe most notable feature on display was a new DualShock 4 controller designed in tandem with a stereo camera, similar to Microsoft's Kinect. The device includes motion sensor, a touchpad on the front, and a light bar to easily identify players. There's also a Share button where players can easily distribute content such as videos to friends.\n\nSony also says the new system uses highly advanced graphics processing, akin to high-end PCs.\n\nThe PS4 will also have a heavily integrated social component, as well as a \"Remote Play\" feature that will take advantage of the company's PlayStation Vita mobile device.\n\nSony leverages its relationship with streaming game service Gaikai, offering players the ability to instantly try games on the PlayStation store, and broadcast their play sessions in real time with the option to even let a friend watch or pick up the action.\n\nMark Cerny, the lead system architect of the PS4, called the new console \"an evolution\" in video games. \"We wanted to make sure that nothing came between the platform and the joy of play,\" he says.\n\n\n\nSeveral high-profile studios appeared in support of the console, including Halo creator Bungie, who say its upcoming online action franchise Destiny will appear on the device, and World of Warcraft studio Blizzard, which will launch action role-playing game Diablo III for PS4. Square Enix also confirmed a new Final Fantasy title is in the works.\n\n\n\n\"We're already seeing tremendous consumer demand for this product,\" says Tony Bartel of video game retailer GameStop. \"We see this as a real game changer in the industry.\"\n\n\"Sony is taking their next-generation platform in the proper direction,\" says Jesse Divnich, analyst with Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. \"Judging by today's presentation, Sony is putting a strong focus on game content and connectivity, which is the lifeblood of any platform, and we are ecstatic that an entirely new generation of content is right around the corner.\"\n\nAfter dominating earlier console generations with its original PlayStation and 2001's PlayStation 2, which sold more than 155 million worldwide, Sony lost traction in the PS3 era to Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii.\n\nThe next console generation started last November, when Nintendo launched its Wii U device with a tablet-style GamePad controller. Global sales have topped 3 million.\n\nThe arrival of new hardware could not come at a better time for the video game industry, which finished last year with a 22% plunge in sales. One reason for the decline is a console cycle that's lasted longer than previous generations. The Xbox 360 is approaching its eighth year on store shelves, while the PS3 and Wii have been available for more than six years.\n\n\"Developers have really squeezed out every last bit of innovation they could out of the current hardware,\" says Divnich. \"Both developers and consumers are screaming for new technology.\"\n\nMeanwhile, home consoles must contend with the rising smartphone and tablet gaming market, which features a wide selection of games for a lower price, sometimes free. However, Digital World Research CEO P.J. McNealy says there is still plenty of opportunity for video game hardware makers.\n\n\"The death knell for the console business is a little premature,\" says McNealy. \"We've got at least one more good console cycle here. There's still an element of gaming on a console in front of a big TV that can't be replicated on a mid- or small screen.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/20"}]}

Although RSV does not typically send as many adults to the hospital, it can be a serious and even deadly disease for seniors and people with underlying health conditions.\n\nAnd with more kids getting RSV, the chances that adults will be exposed also rise. Some doctors say they are starting to see an uptick in adult patients.\n\nThis season, about 6 out of every 100,000 seniors has been hospitalized with RSV, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s significantly lower than the rate for children but still uncharacteristically high. In the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitalization rates for seniors were about 10 times lower at this point in the season.\n\nDr. Ann Falsey, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has published research on RSV in adults, said RSV rose somewhat in children in the summer and early fall last year, but the US did not see the usual proportional increase in RSV in older adults at the time.\n\n“I think that older adults were more cautious to continue public health measures like masks and social distance last year because they were still worrying about Covid,” Falsey said. “But this year, we’re starting to see older people ending up in the hospital again with RSV, because everyone is throwing caution to the wind.”\n\nVirus flies under the radar in adults\n\nToo often, RSV flies under the radar in adults, she said. Many people, even doctors, overlook its impact on adults.\n\n“They think of it as strictly a pediatric disease, but you know, if you don’t test for it, you’ll never know what somebody actually is sick with,” Falsey said.\n\nIn the United States, tracking viruses like RSV isn’t nearly as thorough as it is for Covid-19, so it is difficult to know exactly how many adults get sick with RSV. The numbers of RSV cases come from self reports that go to a few dozen labs that only represent about a tenth of the population, and reports are then shared with the CDC.\n\nBased on best estimates, there are between 10,000 and 15,000 adult deaths in the United States from RSV each year and around 150,000 hospitalizations for RSV, Falsey said.\n\nA 2015 study of older adults in industrialized countries said the disease burden of RSV is “substantial” and calculated that about 14.5% of the 1.5 million adults who caught RSV were admitted to hospitals. People who were 65 and older were more likely to be hospitalized than those ages 50 to 64.\n\n“When we compare it to influenza A, it’s not too far behind,” Falsey said, referring to one of the strains of seasonal flu that’s often linked with more severe illness.\n\nRSV symptoms in adults\n\nRSV shows up in adults the same way it does in kids. It can look like a common cold and include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. The symptoms typically last a week or two, and they clear up with rest and fluids.\n\nBut in some adults, RSV can become dangerous because it can lead to dehydration, breathing trouble and more serious illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs.\n\nAdults at risk for severe illness from RSV\n\nThe adults who are most seriously at risk for severe outcomes with RSV are those 65 and older. The virus can spread quickly through a nursing home or long-term care facility, just like Covid-19 and flu.\n\nAdults with weakened immune systems need to be careful in RSV season. This can include people undergoing treatment for cancer, transplant patients, people with HIV and those who take certain drugs that suppress the immune system for diseases like Crohn’s, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAdults with chronic heart or lung disease like asthma, COPD or heart failure are also more likely to have to go to the hospital if they catch RSV.\n\nHow RSV spreads\n\nAn infected person can pass on RSV through a cough or sneeze. If the respiratory droplets land on a surface like a doorknob or desk and someone else touches it and then touches their face, they can get sick.\n\nIt also spreads because healthy adults often won’t know they have it. It doesn’t typically cause fatigue like the flu or Covid does, so many adults will go to work or jump on a plane or bus, chalking up their symptoms to allergies. As they interact with others, it spreads further.\n\nRSV can easily spread from children to adults, too.\n\nWhat do you do if you get RSV\n\nIf you have been coughing or have any other RSV-like symptoms and you are in a high-risk category, you should go to your doctor and get it checked out, says Dr. Daphne-Dominique Villanueva.\n\n“We can’t test everybody right now – in an ideal world we would want to do that – but we want to concentrate on vulnerable people,” said Villanueva, an assistant professor in the School of Medicine at West Virginia University who has written studies about RSV.\n\nDoctors’ offices have swab tests that can determine whether an illness is flu, RSV or Covid.\n\nThere are specific antivirals for flu and Covid-19 but not for RSV. The trick is getting tested early, even to rule out RSV; getting started on Covid or flu antivirals right away can shorten the time you are sick and keep the virus from progressing to something more serious.\n\nWith RSV, the treatment is what’s called supportive care: Drink plenty of fluids. Get some real rest. Stay home so you don’t spread it. Wear a mask around others in your home.\n\nIf you start to wheeze and feel short of breath, Falsey said, those would be clear signals that you should see a doctor or maybe even take yourself to an emergency room quickly. At the hospital, they can give you supplemental oxygen if necessary.\n\nProtection from RSV\n\nThere’s no protection from a vaccine for RSV, but that could change by next season. In the US, there are four RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials. Some are designed to protect infants, and some are being tested in older adults.\n\n“Since we have very limited ways of treating it effectively, you should do whatever you can to prevent getting it in the first place,” Villanueva said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nProtective measures for this busy RSV season will sound familiar: Wash your hands frequently, disinfect surfaces, and wear a mask in crowded spaces.\n\n“You might want to put off that visit for a week to see your grandkids, or you might want to wear a mask if you are going into a crowded place,” Falsey said. “Masks and hand-washing work. I know people are kind of over it, but if you’re a frail person or you know you have underlying medical conditions, when we know that RSV is surging, you should do those things and use caution around children who are actively sick. It all helps.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/business/maersk/index.html", "title": "Maersk CEO sees more supply chain trouble ahead | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nMaersk has a front-row seat to global supply chains.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for comment.\n\nThe Michigan-based sanitation company, which participated in cleanup after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has been active throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, aiding sanitation efforts in hospitals, fire departments, arenas and airports, according to CEO Sheldon Yellen. BELFOR also helped to construct a drive-thru testing facility in South Carolina.\n\n\"This is what we do, not just during this COVID-19 time, this is what we do,\" Yellen told USA TODAY. \"We have approximately 9,200 employees around the world, and they are full-time employees. These are people with years and years and years of experience.\"\n\nCleaning the ship's 18 decks, 1,300+ cabins and numerous common areas on Diamond Princess took the efforts of 240 workers from the company's Japan and North American operations, including its environmental, HVAC and marine divisions. Yellen says all wore disposable biohazard suits, along with booties, gloves and full-face respirators. And it took nearly all of March to fully disinfect the ship.\n\nPrincess Cruises would not disclose the cost of the project.\n\nHow disinfection worked\n\nBELFOR disinfected all public and crew access areas, staterooms, crew cabins, dining and entertainment areas on the Diamond Princess.\n\nBecause the ship had a confirmed COVID-19 contamination, the company performed what is known as a \"level-three\" cleanup, the most thorough of all cleanings.\n\nBELFOR followed protocols established by the Arkansas-based consulting firm Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH), which served as the industrial hygienist on the job; the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; and Princess Cruises.\n\n\"'Level three' already existed in the cruise world,\" Kamali said, noting it was \"originally written in response to norovirus but includes disinfectant that disinfects against coronavirus, as well.\"\n\nThe CDC was not directly involved, given that the ship was not under U.S. jurisdiction when it was under quarantine in Japan. And the Japanese health ministry required that the sanitation of the vessel be completed there, Alivia Owyoung Ender, spokesperson for Princess Cruises, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"CDC provided feedback on the disinfection plan at the cruise line’s request,\" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY, adding the plan was reviewed by the World Health Organization and the Japan Ministry of Health.\n\n\"We followed an extensive protocol, which included worker safety guidelines; disinfection chemicals that were to be used for each type of space; methods to be used for applying the disinfectants; and process for documenting the disinfection process,\" David Watts, the senior industrial hygienist at CTEH, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe process included:\n\nRemoval of all linens, bedding and other material goods\n\nDisinfection of the entire vessel, including \"high-touch surfaces\"\n\nDisinfection of carpet and hard surface cleaning\n\nDisinfection and cleaning of HVAC systems throughout the ship\n\n\"Soft materials (linens, towels, etc.) were discarded and have been replaced,\" Owyoung Ender said.\n\nHigh-touch surfaces including doorknobs, lobby doors, handrails and corridors were wiped down, Yellen said. Then, \"low-contact nonporous surfaces\" were cleaned using an electrostatic sprayer or an aerosolized mister for broader application, which is used on flooring, walls, furniture and metal, among other surfaces. The carpets and HVAC systems and any associated mechanical systems and ductwork were also cleaned.\n\nFor all COVID-19 related projects, BELFOR uses an EPA-registered product suitable for COVID-19 but was unable to disclose any brand names.\n\nAs the process continued, each room was checked, cleared and then taped off to avoid any chance of recontamination. When the entire job was finished, Japan's health ministry signed off.\n\n\"Princess Cruises, CTEH, MHLW and BELFOR agreed on what would make the vessel safe for reentry, and this was monitored real-time during the process, and at the end of the cleaning it was determined and agreed that this had been accomplished,\" said Kirk Lively, director of technical services at BELFOR.\n\nAfter the disinfection process was complete, Diamond Princess moved from its location at Daikoku terminal in Yokohama harbor to a nearby shipyard for refurbishment projects including the replacement of mattresses, linens, games, toys and some other technical tasks. This is expected to be complete in May, according to the March 31 statement.\n\nA day in the life of a cruise ship cleaner\n\nCleaning was conducted seven days per week, Yellen said, with employees working first in two rotating 12-hour shifts, before moving to three rotating shifts of eight hours.\n\nTom Yacobellis, who leads the National Service Team of DUCTZ, the mechanical and HVAC division of BELFOR, was part of the cleaning effort and recounted his experience to USA TODAY. He said most workers began their days around 6:30 a.m. and finished by 7 p.m., though he wasn't done until 9 p.m. most nights.\n\nEach day began with employees taking chartered buses to the port in Yokohama where the Diamond Princess was docked. Once on site, employees went through medical checks and had their temperatures recorded.\n\n\"The teams would break into smaller workgroups and would all be assigned specific tasks through a strict supervisory structure,\" said Yacobellis. \"The workers had to be scanned into and out of the ship with ship-assigned name badges every time they got off and on.\"\n\nThen, after the laborious process of getting into their personal protective equipment (PPE), employees were inspected once again before entering the ship. PPE was to remain in place at all times while on board.\n\n\"The process of donning and doffing the PPE could take up to 45 minutes to be certain of proper protection,\" Yacobellis explained. \"This process had to be meticulously applied in order to maintain safety for everyone involved.\"\n\nWhile the PPE was necessary for the workers' safety, it also complicated their communication efforts.\n\n\"It was difficult for our managers to determine who they were speaking to while on board because everyone [had] a full white suit on and the full face respirator was covering most of their faces with only the ability to see their eyes,\" he recounted. So many of them ended up writing their names on their suits to help with identification.\n\nWhile working on the ship, CTEH implemented and monitored a computerized tracking system to ensure that the sanitization process was completed in order and in accordance with the Japan Ministry of Health.\n\nThroughout the process, BELFOR managers met with CTEH reps and Princess Cruises daily to keep them updated on the ongoing process and check on quality control.\n\nDespite his time on the ship, Yacobellis said he didn't have any concerns.\n\nBecause of all the health checks required, he said that many of the employees working on the ship's sanitization felt they \"were in the safest place on earth.\"\n\nSo is the cruise ship safe?\n\n\"Following recommended social distancing guidelines, crew members and the public should feel confident about boarding the Diamond Princess,\" CTEH's Watts said.\n\nAdditionally, any traces of coronavirus would likely be dead by now, according to officials, he noted.\n\n\"The vessel has now been empty for more than 45 days – significantly beyond health officials' predictions for how long the virus is able to live on surfaces,\" he added.\n\nJust how long that is ranges from hours to days depending on the surface in question and the humidity of that environment, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC's study found that genetic material from the coronavirus had stayed on surfaces aboard the Diamond Princess as long as 17 days.\n\n\"Not a single space – not a room, a closet or a cubby hole on the Diamond Princess ship went without completing the disinfection protocol with scrutiny on several levels,\" Yacobellis said. \"The cleaning checks and cross-checks were above reproach.\"\n\nHow confident is Yellen about the sanitation job his team did? He accepted Princess' invitation to sail on the Diamond Princess' first voyage after the pandemic has passed and says he plans to be on board – without any PPE this time.\n\nWill the cruise industry make lasting changes?\n\nLooking forward, Yellen said the best way to avoid another outbreak similar to the one that occurred on the Diamond Princess is to take preventative measures. Ongoing maintenance and housekeeping is \"key,\" he said.\n\nGoing forward, Princess Cruises said that new health protocols are going to be put in place.\n\n\"In addition to the sanitation efforts, our team of medical experts is actively developing a comprehensive set of new health protocols,\" spokesperson Kamali told USA TODAY.\n\nSome protocols have been enhanced or added since the COVID-19 outbreak began, such as health screenings including a thermal scan, free flowing hand sanitizer and increased cleaning. The enhancements are posted on the Princess Cruises website.\n\nThe Diamond Princess was not the only ship to be ravaged by coronavirus: the CDC released a report that identified more than 20 ships affected by the virus that made port calls or disembarked in the U.S., including other Princess ships.\n\nAt least 100 cases were linked to the Grand Princess with at least two people dying in March, and the Coral Princess had more than a dozen cases and at least two COVID-19 deaths when it docked in Miami earlier this month. A third died at a local hospital shortly afterward. And the Ruby Princess prompted a criminal investigation after it docked in Australia and disembarked 2,700 passengers and crew. It became the largest source of coronavirus in the country with more than 300 cases and more than 20 deaths linked to the ship.\n\n'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe – and will they change?\n\nWhen cruise lines do begin sailing once again, after the CDC's no-sail order expires this summer, there could also be industrywide steps taken to help avoid or deal with this kind of outbreak in the future.\n\nThough the industry's leading trade organization has not announced any long-term changes on ships in response to the coronavirus outbreak, some may be on the table.\n\n“As cruise lines begin planning for the future, they are exploring ways to go further still to improve upon their already robust public health protocols, including additional screening requirements and enhanced sanitation measures,\" Bari Golin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications for Cruise Lines International Association, said Monday.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that it is working on plans for preventing and containing further outbreaks of COVID-19 and other viruses on board cruise ships and noted they will be similar to its Vessel Sanitation Program, a protocol for dealing with gastrointestinal illnesses on board.\n\nIn fact, when the CDC issued its no-sail order extension on April 9, it required all ships that sail in U.S. waters to create plans to address coronavirus prevention and response.\n\n\"Ships are currently formulating similar plans to address outbreaks of COVID-19, and these plans could also be modified to prevent and respond to other communicable illnesses in the future,\" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY.\n\nIt remains to be seen what those tougher measures might entail. If rapid testing for the coronavirus becomes more readily available, that's a possibility. It's also unclear whether crew or passengers would be required to wear masks on board.\n\nCruise lines \"have a duty to mitigate foreseeable risks,\" said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in representing travel companies. It \"requires a plan, screening people, kicking off people who are sick.\"\n\nWould former passengers get back on?\n\nJohn and Melanie Herring were on board the Diamond Princess when the ship was quarantined in Japan after the first few cases surfaced in early February. Over the course of the next two weeks, hundreds of people tested positive, including John.\n\nJohn became ill during that period and was transported to Chiba University Hospital on Feb. 13, where he tested positive for coronavirus. He later recovered and returned home to Utah. Melanie left Japan on a U.S. charter flight on Feb. 16 and spent two weeks in isolation at Travis Air Force Base in California, along with other American passengers from the Diamond Princess. The couple didn't see each other again until Melanie was released from quarantine and flew home to Utah in early March.\n\nDespite that ordeal, John told USA TODAY that they would be willing to sail on the Diamond Princess again. (They are able to do so for free, thanks to Princess' offer of a full cruise credit.)\n\n\"We are not afraid and look forward to traveling again as soon as possible,\" he said. \"If the Diamond Princess was going to ports we wanted to see, we would go back aboard.\"\n\nDiamond Princess, Grand Princess: Cruise line had high rates of illness even before coronavirus\n\nContributing: Chris Woodyard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/24"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFossils of early human ancestors from a South African cave are 3.4 million to 3.6 million years old – making them a million years older than previously suspected and shaking up the way researchers understand human origins and evolution.\n\nThis new date makes the Sterkfontein Cave fossils older than the famed Lucy fossil (also known as Dinkinesh) from Ethiopia. Found in 1979, Lucy represented the species Australopithecus afarensis and lived 3.2 million years ago.\n\nThe freshly dated fossils also belong to the genus Australopithecus, an ancient hominin that was initially thought to live 2 million to 2.6 million years ago. Researchers used a new technique to date the sediments of the Sterkfontein Caves, which are part of the Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage Site, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Johannesburg.\n\nThe caves included in this network have revealed details about human and environmental evolution that span about 4 million years.\n\nThe site is home to a treasure trove of fossils that help tell the story of human evolution – a story that seems to shift with each discovery.\n\nA new study detailing the findings was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe importance of the Sterkfontein Caves came to light in 1936, when the discovery of the first adult Australopithecus fossil was made by paleontologist Dr. Robert Broom.\n\nHundreds of Australopithecus fossils have been found there since, including the famous Little Foot, who lived 3.67 million years ago. Today, she represents the most complete Australopithecus skeleton and is helping researchers to learn more about our chimpanzee-like ancestors.\n\n“Sterkfontein has more Australopithecus fossils than anywhere else in the world,” said lead study author Darryl Granger, professor of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences in Purdue University’s College of Science, in a statement.\n\n“But it’s hard to get a good date on them. People have looked at the animal fossils found near them and compared the ages of cave features like flowstones and gotten a range of different dates. What our data does is resolve these controversies. It shows that these fossils are old – much older than we originally thought.”\n\nA new look at ancient ancestors\n\nThe researchers determined that all of the cave sediments including Australopithecus fossils date from 3.4 million to 3.6 million years old, which places them toward the beginning of the Australopithecus era, rather than the end of it. They now predate other hominins at nearby sites by over a million years.\n\nMany of Sterkfontein fossils were found in Member 4, the richest deposit of Australopithecus fossils found anywhere in the world. Previous research had suggested the deposit could be as young as 2 million years ago – younger than when the genus Homo, to which we (Homo sapiens) belong, first appeared about 3 million years ago.\n\nThose dates suggested that Australopithecines overlapped with members of the Homo genus, as well as a large-toothed hominin called Paranthropus. Based on that idea, researchers up until now have accepted that South African Australopiths were descended from East African species, like Lucy and other members of Australopithecus afarensis.\n\n“What our age shows is that this cannot be true, because they are virtually the same age,” Granger said. “There must be an older common ancestor. It also gives much more time for the South African species to evolve, and reopens discussion about the role of the South African species into later hominins such as Paranthropus.”\n\nReassessing the age of the Sterkfontein Australopiths has important implications for how South Africa played a part in the diversification and expansion of our early human ancestors, said study coauthor Dominic Stratford, director of research at the caves and a professor at University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\nLooking into the past\n\nTo date cave sediments, Granger applied a method he first developed in the mid ’90s that’s now used by many researchers in the field.\n\nGranger works with cosmogenic nuclides, “very rare radioactive particles that are produced inside mineral grains by cosmic rays coming from space,” he said. Aluminum-26 and beryllium-10 are two examples of cosmogenic nuclides, both found in the mineral quartz. Aluminum-26 forms when a rock is exposed to cosmic rays while sitting on the Earth’s surface. But that can’t happen once it’s inside a cave.\n\nThe PRIME Lab FN tandem accelerator at Purdue University was used to secure the new dates of the fossils. John Underwood/Purdue University\n\n“Their radioactive decay dates when the rocks were buried in the cave when they fell in the entrance together with the fossils,” Granger said.\n\nPreviously, he used his method to date the Little Foot fossil. But the age of the other Australopith fossils within the Sterkfontein Caves has been debated, mainly because the deep, complex cave system has a long history of occupation by hominins who lived in the area at the time.\n\nEast Africa is another location rich with early hominin fossils, and many have been found in the Great Rift Valley, where volcanoes have created layers of ash that are easier to date.\n\nThe same isn’t true for South Africa’s caves, where researchers must rely on using animal fossils to help determine the age of other bones they are close to, or calcite flowstone. When water flows on cave walls or floors, it can deposit sheetlike layers of calcite or other carbonate minerals.\n\nDating cave sediments is tricky – and it becomes even more difficult as rocks and bones shift and tumble from different layers in the cave. And younger flowstone can sometimes be found mixed in with old sediment.\n\nRather than the straightforward peeling back of the layers, it’s more like sorting through a mixture.\n\nGranger made a breakthrough in 2014 while working in the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory, and the researchers discovered they could measure small quantities of aluminum-26 very accurately – opening the doors to sites that were previously much harder to date, he said.\n\nGranger and his team studied the breccia, the concrete-like substance where the fossils are embedded, and used his method to determine the new dates of the fossils. The researchers also made maps of cave deposits and showed how some of them became mixed together during excavations that took place during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n“Part of the misconception about its age came from mixing of fossils from different layers during early excavations,” Granger said. “Using this method, we can more accurately place ancient humans and their relatives in the correct time periods, in Africa, and elsewhere across the world.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/07/asia/australia-fossil-site-scn/index.html", "title": "Fossil site discovery tells of Australia's 'origin story' | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

It has everything that we hope for, exceptionally well-preserved fossils from a time that we don’t know a lot about,” said Matthew McCurry, a paleontologist at the Australian Museum Research Institute, who was an author of a study of the site that published in the journal Science Advances on Friday.\n\nA fossilized feather found at the site is shown. Scientists believe it would have been dark brown or black. Dr Matthew McCurry\n\n“The Miocene was the point in time when most of the modern Australian environments were established, and so this fossil site is really Australia’s origin story.”\n\nDuring the Miocene, reduced precipitation caused rainforests around the world to shrink, leading to increasingly arid landscapes, the study said.\n\nThe site, named McGraths Flat and located in the Central Tablelands, near the town of Gulgong, was discovered by a local farmer, who found fossilized leaves in one of his fields, McCurry said.\n\nMcCurry and his colleagues visited and excavated the site seven times.\n\nCache of well-preserved fossils\n\n“The fossils are amazingly pretty to look at, and by using a microscope we can look at the detail for the surfaces of the fossils that are also amazingly well preserved,” he said via email.\n\n“Features like the individual cells and even organelles within the cells can be seen. This level of detail allows us to say so much more about what these ecosystems were like.”\n\nFor example, melanosomes discovered in a fossilized feather mean that the scientists can determine the feather’s color. In this case, they believe it was dark brown to black.\n\nPaleontologist Matthew McCurry (above), of the Australian Museum Research Institute, and his colleagues visited the fossil site seven times. Dr Matthew McCurry\n\nThe site, formed from iron-rich rock, was destined to be regarded as a Lagerstätte, McCurry said, a German term paleontologists use to describe an exceptional site with many perfectly preserved fossils.\n\nThe plants and creatures were fossilized when iron-rich groundwater drained into a billabong, or water hole.\n\nMcCurry said that his favorite fossil was a type of spider, which was the most well-preserved spider fossil ever found in Australia.\n\n“It’s an extremely beautiful specimen.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/europe/flying-reptile-pterosaur-fossil-skye-scotland-scn/index.html", "title": "Fossil of giant flying reptile discovered on Scottish island | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWinged reptiles known as pterosaurs – airplane-size creatures that swooped through the skies as dinosaurs walked the Earth – were the first vertebrate animals to evolve powered flight.\n\nA spectacular three-dimensional fossil of one previously unknown pterosaur has been discovered on the shore of the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland.\n\nWith a wingspan of more than 2.5 meters (8.2 feet), it’s the biggest pterosaur ever discovered from the Jurassic period and last flapped its wings 170 million years ago. Its sharp teeth, which would have snapped up fish, still retain their shiny enamel.\n\nIn the Cretaceous period, immediately before the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, pterosaurs like Quetzalcoatlus reached the size of fighter jets, with a 12-meter (40-foot) wingspan.\n\nA close-up of the pterosaur's claw is shown. Gregory Funston/University of Edinburgh\n\nHowever, this fossil discovery confirms pterosaurs, sometimes popularly known as pterodactyls, were already very large much earlier in their evolutionary history.\n\n“Pterosaurs preserved in such quality are exceedingly rare and are usually reserved to select rock formations in Brazil and China. And yet, an enormous superbly preserved pterosaur emerged from a tidal platform in Scotland,” said Natalia Jagielska, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh. She was the lead author of a paper on the fossil that published Tuesday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nThe fossil was discovered during a field trip in 2017, after a University of Edinburgh doctoral student, Amelia Penny, spotted its jaw protruding from the rock at an area of Skye known in Gaelic as Rubha nam Brathairean, or Brothers’ Point.\n\nThe pterosaur has been given the Gaelic name Dearc sgiathanach (pronounced jark ski-an-ach), which translates to “winged reptile.”\n\n“This is a superlative Scottish fossil. The preservation is amazing, far beyond any pterosaur ever found in Scotland and probably the best British skeleton found since the days of Mary Anning in the early 1800s,” said Steve Brusatte, professor and Personal Chair of Palaeontology and Evolution in the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nThe pterosaur fossil is the biggest known from the Jurassic period, said Steve Brusatte, University of Edinburgh professor of palaeontology and evolution. University of Edinburgh\n\n“Dearc is the biggest pterosaur we know from the Jurassic period, and that tells us that pterosaurs got larger much earlier than we thought, long before the Cretaceous period when they were competing with birds, and that’s hugely significant.”\n\nAnning, an unsung pioneer of paleontology, discovered the 3-meter-long (9.8-foot-long) Plesiosaurus in Dorset, southern England, in 1823. The incredible fossil, the first of the species to be found intact with its snakelike neck, wowed the world, setting in motion a dinomania that gripped Victorian England and continues to this day.\n\nAn illustration depicts the pterosaur, which had a wingspan of more than 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). Natalia Jagielska/University of Edinburgh\n\nA number of astounding discoveries have been made in this area of Skye in recent years, including the footprints of Stegosaurus and other dinosaurs. Paleontologists believe it was once a subtropical lagoon and home to a thriving community of dinosaurs.\n\nJagielska will continue to study the skeleton to understand how the ancient creature lived and flew.\n\n“To achieve flight, pterosaurs had hollow bones with thin bone walls, making their remains incredibly fragile and unfit to (preserve) for millions of years,” she said.\n\n“And yet our skeleton, 160 million years on since its death, remains in almost pristine condition, articulated and almost complete … as if he were alive mere weeks ago.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/21/2020-amazing-science-space-discoveries/3922477001/", "title": "COVID vaccine wasn't only amazing discovery 2020: A year in science", "text": "In 2020, incredible scientific discoveries didn't stop because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFirst and foremost was the phenomenal work done by scientists to study the disease and develop vaccines in record time to put the brakes on the global pandemic. It was a truly Herculean effort by literally thousands of scientists around the world.\n\nOtherwise, while nothing can compare to the vaccine effort for impact, we discovered there could be water on the sunlit surface of the moon, potentially life on Venus, \"Marsquakes\" on Mars, and the chance that dozens of intelligent civilizations could be scattered across our Milky Way galaxy.\n\nCloser to home, we uncovered prehistoric evidence of a ferocious tyrannosaur in Canada, a car-sized turtle in South America, and the oldest bird fossil ever found, dubbed the \"wonderchicken.\"\n\nAnd as for us humans, we listened to a mummy speak after 3,000 years, found Africa's oldest human footprints, and even realized that Neanderthals were skilled fishermen.\n\nHere are just a few of the amazing science stories of 2020:\n\nWe heard the voice of an ancient mummy\n\nIn January, scientists re-created the voice of an ancient, 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy using 3D printing, medical scanners and an electronic larynx, a study said. They were able to reproduce a single vowel sound, which sounds like something between the vowels in the words \"bed\" and \"bad.\" Listen for yourself below.\n\n'Boiling' plasma was spotted on the sun\n\nAlso that month, we saw the most detailed photos of the sun ever taken. One of the images showed a pattern of turbulent \"boiling\" plasma that covers the entire sun. The cell-like structures – each about the size of Texas – are the signature of violent motions that carry heat from the inside of the sun to its surface.\n\nScientists discovered the fossil of a giant turtle\n\nIn February, paleontologists discovered what they called the \"reaper of death,\" a fearsome new species of dinosaur that was the \"oldest occurrence of a large tyrannosaur in Canada.\"\n\nAlso in February, scientists announced the discovery of a huge turtle fossil in South America. It's \"one of the largest, if not the largest, turtle that ever existed,\" scientists said, noting that the colossal, long-extinct beast lived 5 million to 10 million years ago and measured 9½ feet, roughly the size and shape of a midsized car.\n\nNASA's robot detected hundreds of 'marsquakes'\n\nAnd that month we also heard about \"marsquakes,\" and the fact that our red neighbor planet had hundreds of quakes over the past year. The marsquakes were recorded by NASA's InSight, a robot spacecraft that landed on Mars in November 2018. \"We've finally, for the first time, established that Mars is a seismically active planet,\" said NASA's Bruce Banerdt.\n\n'Wonderchicken' becomes oldest bird fossil ever\n\nIn March, our attention turned to a creature dubbed the \"wonderchicken,\" a seagull-size shorebird with features of ducks, chickens and turkeys. The nearly complete skull was hidden inside nondescript pieces of rock, and it dates to more than 66 million years ago – which makes it the oldest bird fossil ever discovered. (That's less than 1 million years before the asteroid impact that killed off all the large dinosaurs.)\n\n\"The moment I first saw what was beneath the rock was the most exciting moment of my scientific career,\" said study lead author Daniel Field.\n\nWe also learned about an ancient wormlike creature that's the ancestor of all animals. The tiny thing, about the size of a grain of rice, lived about 555 million years ago.\n\nWe learned Neanderthals were actually skilled fishermen\n\nAlso in March, the reputation of Neanderthals got a boost when we found out that they weren't just the club-wielding brutes of popular legend, hunting and eating only woolly mammoths in frozen northern climates.\n\nA study, for the first time, suggested that they were skilled fishermen and that seafood was a key ingredient in their diets.\n\nA comet from outside our solar system paid a visit\n\nIn April, we tracked an unusual visitor from outer space: Comet 2I/Borisov, which astronomers described as a \"snowman from a dark and cold place,\" because “comets are leftover building blocks from the time of planet formation.\"\n\n“This is the first time we’ve ever looked inside a comet from outside our solar system,” said NASA astrochemist Martin Cordiner.\n\nBizarre mammal called 'crazy beast' fossil discovered in Madagascar\n\nAlso in April, we learned about the fossil of a bizarre mammal, called \"crazy beast,\" which was discovered in Madagascar. The skeleton is the most complete for any Mesozoic mammal yet discovered in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe 66-million-year-old opossum-size fossil represented a new species, which the study authors have named \"Adalatherium hui,\" from a Malagasy word meaning “crazy” and the Greek word for “beast.”\n\nScientists spot 'incredibly rare' Super-Earth\n\nMeanwhile, in May, scientists announced the discovery of an incredibly rare \"Super-Earth,\" which they said was a \"one in a million\" find. Also calling it \"incredibly rare,\" New Zealand astronomers say the planet \"is one of only a handful that have been discovered with both size and orbit comparable to that of Earth.\"\n\nAfrica's largest group of human fossil footprints were uncovered\n\nMay also was when we found out about Africa's largest group of human fossil footprints, which were discovered in Tanzania. Thousands of years ago, a group of 17 people took a walk through the mud in eastern Africa. Amazingly, their footprints are still there today, and were recently identified by archaeologists.\n\nWe learned there could be 'dozens' of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy\n\nIn June, we got the news that we're probably not alone in our galaxy: There could be \"dozens\" of intelligent civilizations scattered throughout the Milky Way.\n\n“There should be at least a few dozen active civilizations in our galaxy under the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent life to form on other planets, as on Earth,” University of Nottingham astrophysicist Christopher Conselice said.\n\nThis estimate assumes that intelligent life forms on other planets in a similar way as it does on Earth.\n\nAn asteroid impact, not volcanoes, killed off dinosaurs\n\nAlso in June we learned for sure that an asteroid impact – not volcanic eruptions – killed off the dinosaurs. The asteroid strike would have released particles and gases high into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun for years and causing permanent winters, a study said.\n\n\"Our study confirms, for the first time quantitatively, that the only plausible explanation for the extinction is the impact winter that eradicated dinosaur habitats worldwide,\" said study lead author Alessandro Chiarenza of Imperial College London.\n\nScientists confirmed the universe is 13.8 billion years old\n\nThe discoveries continued in the second half of the year: Scientists confirmed in July that the universe is 13.8 billion years old. While this estimate had been known, in recent years other scientific measurements had suggested instead the universe may be hundreds of millions of years younger than that. The scientists studied an image of the oldest light in the universe to confirm its age of 13.8 billion years.\n\nComet Neowise made a rare appearance\n\nAlso in July, folks got a rare chance to spot another interstellar interloper: Comet Neowise. “Discovered on March 27, 2020, by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) mission, Comet Neowise is putting on a dazzling display for skywatchers before it disappears, not to be seen again for another 6,800 years,” NASA said in July.\n\nGreenland's melting ice sheet passed the point of no return\n\nAlso in August, in unsettling news, scientists said Greenland's melting ice sheet had passed the point of no return. In fact, glaciers on the island have shrunk so much that even if global warming were to stop today, the ice sheet would continue shrinking, a study suggested.\n\n\"Glacier retreat has knocked the dynamics of the whole ice sheet into a constant state of loss,\" said study co-author Ian Howat, an earth scientist from Ohio State University.\n\nAstronomers see hint of life on Venus\n\nScientists in September announced the discovery of a possible sign of life high in the clouds of Venus. Using telescopes based in Chile and Hawaii, astronomers spotted in Venus' clouds the chemical signature of phosphine, a noxious gas that on Earth is associated only with life. Based on the many scenarios the astronomers considered, the team concluded there is no explanation for the phosphine in Venus’ clouds other than the presence of life.\n\nWater discovered on sunlit part of the moon for the first time\n\nIn October, we learned that water had been discovered on the sunlit surface of the moon for the first time. NASA said this was an important revelation that indicates water may be distributed across the lunar surface – and not just limited to its cold, shadowed places such as the poles. This is good news for astronauts at future lunar bases who could tap into those resources for drinking and rocket fuel production.\n\n“We had indications that H2O – the familiar water we know – might be present on the sunlit side of the moon,” said Paul Hertz, director of the astrophysics division in the science mission directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. “Now we know it is there. This discovery challenges our understanding of the lunar surface and raises intriguing questions about resources relevant for deep space exploration.”\n\nThere's a metal asteroid out there worth $10,000 quadrillion\n\nThis isn't your typical space rock. Also in October, we found out that the asteroid 16 Psyche – one of the most massive objects in the main asteroid belt orbiting between Mars and Jupiter – could be made entirely of metal, according to a study.\n\nEven more intriguing, the asteroid's metal is worth an estimated $10,000 quadrillion (that's 15 more zeroes), more than the entire economy of Earth.\n\nRadio bursts were detected from within our Milky Way for first time\n\nFor the first time, astronomers in November discovered a \"fast radio burst\" that came from within our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThey also believe they have found a source of one of the bursts, which are extremely bright flashes of energy that last for a fraction of a second, during which they can blast out more than 100 million times more power than our sun.\n\nIt appears the radio pulses were produced by a magnetar – a type of neutron star with a hugely powerful magnetic field.\n\nA 50-year-old science problem was solved\n\nAnd in December, we learned about the arcane field of \"protein folding.\" A new discovery about the field could unlock a world of possibilities into the understanding of everything from diseases to drugs, researchers say. The breakthrough sent ripples of excitement through the science and medical communities because it deals with the shapes tiny proteins in our bodies – essential to all life – fold into.\n\nThe \"protein-folding problem\" has puzzled scientists for five decades, and the discovery from the London-based artificial intelligence lab DeepMind was heralded as a major milestone.\n\n\"This computational work represents a stunning advance on the protein-folding problem, a 50-year old grand challenge in biology,\" said Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the U.K.'s Royal Society.\n\nWe learned mass extinctions of Earth's land animals follow a cycle\n\nAlso in December, we found out that mass extinctions of life on Earth appear to follow a regular pattern, according to a study. In fact, widespread die-offs of land-dwelling animals – which include amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds – follow a cycle of about 27 million years, the study reports. The study also said these mass extinctions coincide with major asteroid impacts and devastating volcanic outpourings of lava.\n\n\"The global mass extinctions were apparently caused by the largest cataclysmic impacts and massive volcanism, perhaps sometimes working in concert,\" said study lead author Michael Rampino of New York University.\n\nMore news from 2020 you don't want to forget\n\nAstronomers say 'disappearing planet' may never have existed\n\nWalking sharks discovered near Australia but there's no need to head for the hills\n\nNASA is dropping racially insensitive nicknames from cosmic objects\n\nWarm water discovered beneath Antarctica's 'doomsday' glacier, scientists say", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/world/ichthyosaur-fossil-swiss-alps-scn/index.html", "title": "'Fish lizard' fossils found in Swiss Alps belonged to some of the ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe fossils of giant, extinct marine reptiles have been found in an unlikely place: within the high altitudes of the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe fossils belong to three ichthyosaurs, and they may have been some of the largest animals that ever lived on Earth, according to a new study. The ancient creatures could reach 80 tons and 65 feet (20 meters) in length, rivaling modern sperm whales.\n\nThese “fish lizards” first appeared in the ocean about 250 million years ago, looking a bit like dolphins with elongated bodies and small heads. They emerged after the Permian mass extinction wiped out more than 95% of marine species. But by 200 million years ago, the giant ichthyosaurs were extinct and only the smaller, more dolphin-like ones lived until 90 million years ago.\n\nA study detailing the discovery published Thursday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\nSo how did the remains of massive sea creatures, including one longer than a bowling alley, end up at an altitude of 9,186 feet (2,800 meters)?\n\nAbout 200 million years ago, those rock layers were the floor of a wide lagoon.\n\n“We think that the big ichthyosaurs followed schools of fish into the lagoon. The fossils may also derive from strays that died there,” said study coauthor Heinz Furrer, retired curator at the University of Zurich’s Paleontological Institute and Museum, in a statement.\n\nBut the folding of the Alps, which began 95 million years ago when the African tectonic plate began to push up against the European tectonic plate, created piles of rock layers about 30 to 40 million years ago. The fossils were “tectonically deformed,” squashed by the tectonic plate movements that pushed them to a rock formation at the top of a mountain.\n\n“You have to be kind of a mountain goat to access the relevant beds,” said lead study author P. Martin Sander, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bonn in Germany, in a statement. “They have the vexing property of not occurring below about 8,000 feet (2,438.4 meters), way above the treeline.”\n\nAlthough these creatures once ruled the seas, fossils are rare, which has created a great mystery for paleontologists. But the remains of these ichthyosaurs have shed new light on these enigmatic, extinct creatures.\n\nOne huge tooth\n\nThe fossils belonged to three different ichthyosaurs. One was about 65 feet (20 meters) long while the other was 49 feet (15 meters) long. But the most exciting find associated with these fossils is the largest ichthyosaur tooth ever found.\n\n“This is huge by ichthyosaur standards: Its root was 60 millimeters in diameter — the largest specimen still in a complete skull to date was 20 millimeters and came from an ichthyosaur that was nearly 18 meters (59 feet) long,” Sander said.\n\nScientists know that smaller ichthyosaurs had teeth, but most of the giant ones were toothless, and it was assumed they fed on cephalopods, like squid, through suction.\n\nGiant ichthyosaurs with teeth were likely similar to sperm whales and killer whales today, using their teeth to capture prey like giant squid.\n\nBut the tooth presents a challenge because it was broken off at the crown. While researchers know it was an ichthyosaur tooth because of unique features, like the infolding of dentin in the tooth root, they can’t be sure that the size of the tooth reflects the size of the animal.\n\nThis is the thickest ichthyosaur tooth found so far. Rosi Roth/University of Zurich\n\n“It is hard to say if the tooth is from a large ichthyosaur with giant teeth or from a giant ichthyosaur with average-sized teeth,” Sander said.\n\nThis is because, according to researchers, being giant and being a predator (with teeth) don’t align – which is why the blue whale, which weighs 150 tons and can reach 98 feet (30 meters) long, doesn’t have any teeth. Instead, it filters out tiny creatures from the water.\n\nMeanwhile, sperm whales, which weigh 50 tons and reach 65 feet (20 meters) in length, are hunters.\n\n“Marine predators therefore probably can’t get much bigger than a sperm whale,” Sander said.\n\nGiants in the mountains\n\nThe fossils were first discovered during geological mapping of the Alps between 1976 and 1990. Furrer was part of the original team that recovered the fossils from the rocks, known as the Kössen Formation, and remembers holding the fossils in his hand as a doctoral student at the University of Zurich.\n\nStudy coauthor Heinz Furrer is pictured holding the largest ichthyosaur vertebrae. Rosi Roth/University of Zurich\n\nOver time, the fossils were largely forgotten.\n\n“Recently, though, more remains of giant ichthyosaurs have appeared,” Furrer said. “So it seemed worthwhile to us to analyze the Swiss finds again in more detail as well.”\n\nIchthyosaur fossils have been found around the world, but the remains of giant species have been concentrated in North America. Finding these specimens in modern-day Switzerland expands their range.\n\nPrevious evidence has suggested that some of them could reach the size of blue whales, the largest animal in the world.\n\n“In Nevada, we see the beginnings of true giants, and in the Alps the end,” Sander said. “Only the medium-to-large-sized dolphin – and orca-like forms survived into the Jurassic (Period),” between 145 and 201 million years ago.\n\nSander wonders if there are more “giant sea creatures hidden beneath the glaciers.” But these fossils help fill a knowledge gap about the giant marine lizards.\n\n“It amounts to a major embarrassment for paleontology that we know so little about these giant ichthyosaurs despite the extraordinary size of their fossils,” Sander said. “We hope to rise to this challenge and find new and better fossils soon.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/09/13/complete-dinosaur-skeleton-skin-mummy/10369447002/", "title": "Researchers believe they found a preserved dinosaur with skin intact", "text": "Researchers in Canada have discovered parts of what they believe to be a full \"dinosaur mummy\" lodged in a hillside, the University of Reading in the United Kingdom announced last week.\n\nThe two exposed fossils, a foot and part of a tail clad in fossilized skin, are believed to belong to a juvenile duck-billed Hadrosaur dinosaur that died somewhere between 77 million to 75 million years ago, roughly 10 million years before dinosaurs went extinct, researchers said. Scientists began excavation of the site to remove the entire remains from the hill.\n\n“It’s so well preserved you can see the individual scales, we can see some tendons and it looks like there’s going to be skin over the entire animal,” Brian Pickles, a paleontologist and ecology professor at the University of Reading, told USA TODAY. “Which means, if we’re really lucky, then some of the other internal organs might have preserved as well.”\n\nIf the remains are in as good of shape as Pickles hopes, it would be one of the best preserved dinosaur fossils ever discovered and would provide scientists with a clearer picture of what the dinosaur looked like when it roamed the Earth.\n\nIn the best case scenario, the creature’s stomach contents might be preserved, allowing scientists to determine the animal’s last meal, Pickles said.\n\n'Perfectly preserved'\n\nA member of a field team led by Pickles, paleontologist Caleb Brown of Canada’s Royal Tyrrell Museum and scientists the University of New England in Australia first spotted the fossil poking out of a cliffside while on a scouting trip for an international field school last year at the Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine. This animal died 76 million years ago. It’s been perfectly preserved since then and it just happened to be just starting to erode out of this cliff when we were walking by,” Pickles said.\n\n\"This animal probably either died and then immediately got covered over by sand and silt in the river,\" Pickles said. \"Or it was killed because a river bank fell onto it.\"\n\nHadrosaur fossils are common in North America, but finding juveniles is rare.\n\n“Dinosaurs actually grew quite quickly so finding juveniles in the fossil record is important because it can tell us a lot about how their lives progressed,” Pickles said.\n\nPickles estimates the dinosaur to be about 13 feet long, around the length of a car. Adult Hadrosaurs were about 32 feet long, Pickles said.\n\nDrought fossils: Dinosaur tracks made 113 million years ago revealed by severe Texas drought\n\nIt’s too early to identify the exact species. Scientists will need to analyze the skull, Pickles said.

A small Psittacosaurus in Germany was found with much of its skin and tissue, including its cloaca (functionally, an anus) preserved.\n\nAnd a Borealopelta displayed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum was found with much of its skin intact in Canada a few years ago, the Atlantic reported.\n\nBut the dinosaur in Germany was rather small, and the some of the Borealopelta remains were missing.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nPterosaurs ruled the skies during the age of the dinosaurs, but scientists have long debated if they actually had feathers.\n\nNow we know. Not only did these flying reptiles have feathers, but they could actually control the color of those feathers on a cellular level to create multicolor plumage in a way similar to modern birds, new research has revealed.\n\nThese color patterns, determined by melanin pigments, may have been used as a way for pterosaur species to communicate with each other. A study detailing these findings published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nResearchers analyzed the fossilized headcrest of Tupandactylus imperator, a pterosaur that lived 115 million years ago in Brazil. Upon closer inspection, the paleontologists realized that the bottom of this huge headcrest was rimmed with two kinds of feathers: short, wiry ones that were more similar to hair, as well as fluffier ones that branch like bird feathers.\n\n“We didn’t expect to see this at all,” said lead study author Aude Cincotta, a paleontologist and postdoctoral researcher at the University College Cork in Ireland, in a statement.\n\n“For decades, palaeontologists have argued about whether pterosaurs had feathers,” Cincotta said. “The feathers in our specimen close off that debate for good as they are very clearly branched all the way along their length, just like birds today.”\n\nThe research team studied the feathers with electron microscopes and were surprised to find preserved melanosomes, or granules of melanin. These granules had different shapes, depending on the types of feathers they were associated with on the pterosaur fossil. Patchy color was also found in the preserved soft tissue.\n\n“In birds today, feather colour is strongly linked to melanosome shape,” said study coauthor Maria McNamara, professor of paleontology in the University College Cork’s School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, in a statement.\n\n“Since the pterosaur feather types had different melanosome shapes, these animals must have had the genetic machinery to control the colours of their feathers. This feature is essential for colour patterning and shows that coloration was a critical feature of even the very earliest feathers.”\n\nPreviously, scientists understood that pterosaurs had some kind of whisker-like fluffy covering to help keep them insulated. The new research confirms that this fuzz was actually made from different types of feathers. These feathers and the surrounding skin had different colors, like black, brown, ginger, gray and other tones associated with the different melanin granules.\n\n“This strongly suggests that the pterosaur feathers had different colours,” McNamara said. “The presence of this feature in both dinosaurs (including birds) and pterosaurs indicates shared ancestry, where this feature derives from a common ancestor that lived in the Early Triassic (250 million years ago). Colouration was therefore probably an important driving force in the evolution of feathers even in the earliest days of their evolutionary history.”\n\nSome of these colors helped the pterosaurs to share visual signals with one another, but the team isn’t quite sure what those signals would have meant.\n\nThis artist's reconstruction of Tupandactylus shows dark monofilaments and lighter-colored branched feathers along the crest. Julio Lacerda\n\n“We would need to know the precise hue and pattern to work this out,” McNamara said. “Unfortunately we can’t do either at the moment, with current data. We need to look at melanosomes in feathers across the body to work out whether they were patterned, and we need to figure out whether traces of non-melanin pigments can be detected.”\n\nTupandactylus was an odd-looking creature, with a wingspan of 16 feet (5 meters) and a huge (albeit lightweight) head with toothless jaws. Its giant crest had irregular blooms of color.\n\n“Perhaps they were used in pre-mating rituals, just as certain birds use colourful tail fans, wings and head crests to attract mates,” wrote Michael Benton, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol’s School of Earth Sciences, in a News and Views article that published with the study. Benton was not involved in the research.\n\n“Modern birds are renowned for the diversity and complexity of their colourful displays, and for the role of these aspects of sexual selection in bird evolution, and the same might be true for a wide array of extinct animals, including dinosaurs and pterosaurs,” Benton wrote.\n\nMaria McNamara holds a sample of the tiny pterosaur feathers. Daragh Mc Sweeney/Provision\n\nThe discovery could allow for a better understanding of pterosaurs, which first appeared about 230 million years ago and went extinct along with the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\n“This finding opens up opportunities to explore new aspects of pterosaur behaviour, and to revisit previously described specimens for further insights into feather structure and functional evolution,” McNamara said.\n\nThe fossil, originally recovered from northeastern Brazil, has been repatriated to its home country thanks to efforts by the scientists and a private donor.\n\n“It is so important that scientifically important fossils such as this are returned to their countries of origin and safely conserved for posterity” said study coauthor Pascal Godefroit, paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, in a statement. “These fossils can then be made available to scientists for further study and can inspire future generations of scientists through public exhibitions that celebrate our natural heritage”.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/world/dinosaur-tail-whips-sonic-boom-scn/index.html", "title": "Could these dinosaurs whip their tails faster than the speed of sound ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nDiplodocids were a family of dinosaurs with long necks and, often, even longer tails — some species’ tails reached 50 feet in length. They were wide-ranging, but especially flourished in what’s now the western US around 152 million years ago.\n\nFor decades, scientists have debated whether these dinosaurs could whip their tails faster than the speed of sound, creating a sonic boom.\n\nThe sound of a cracking whip is actually a sonic boom. When something — a whip, a plane, or a dinosaur tail, for example — moves through the air, it creates pressure waves. If the moving object is traveling faster than the speed of sound, around 767 miles (or roughly 1,235 kilometers) per hour, then the pressure waves can’t keep up with the object, and they are compressed together like water in the wake of a speedboat. This compression produces a shock wave, and when that shock wave reaches an observer’s ear, they will hear all the compressed pressure waves associated with the object’s movement at once: a sonic boom.\n\nThe most recent study, published in Scientific Reports, suggests that while these dinosaurs’ tails couldn’t break the sound barrier, they could still move very fast — and be used to defend against predators.\n\nDueling dinosaur tails\n\nFor more than a century, scientists hypothesized diplodocid dinosaurs like Diplodocus and Apatosaurus (debatably, the more correct name for Brontosaurus) might have whipped their long, skinny tails around as a means of defense or even communication, but it wasn’t until 1997 that researchers published a case for the tails making a whip-crack sound. Then-chief technology officer of Microsoft and amateur paleontologist Nathan Myhrvold had become interested in the physics of cracking whips, and reached out to University of Alberta paleontologist Philip Currie to ask if a diplodocid’s tail could make a similar sound.\n\nDiplodocus skeletons at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. Sabah Ahmed/Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\n“I gave him all kinds of information on measurements for sauropod tails,” said Currie. “He started computer modeling it to see what he could do with it. And ultimately, it showed, certainly to my satisfaction, that these things almost certainly broke the sound barrier.”\n\nTo go along with the computer model published in 1997, Myhrvold and Currie built a 12-foot-long working model of a diplodocid tail out of steel and aluminum, and added a fringed “popper” from the tip of a bullwhip, which helps a whip attain its sound barrier-breaking speeds. Their model, which they unveiled in 2015, was indeed able to make a whip-cracking sound: a sonic boom.\n\nBut the new research has a bone to pick with this model: namely, that metal behaves differently than bone (and flesh and skin).\n\n“It would break apart”\n\nA few years after Currie and Myhrvold unveiled their metal model, Simone Conti, a doctoral student in a joint paleontology-engineering program with Portugal’s Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Italy’s Politecnico di Milano, began building his own. Conti’s model was digital; he wanted to practice multibody simulation, a method for studying how different materials move. As proof of concept, Conti looked to Currie and Myhrvold’s sound barrier-breaking dinosaur tails.\n\nUsing open-source software, he tried to simulate a diplodocid tail moving at the speed of sound and included hypothetical constraints for the biomechanical properties of the dinosaur’s skin, bone, and flesh. He was surprised to see that it didn’t work.\n\n“I kept getting errors that my simulation was not able to complete itself,” said Conti. “During the simulation, the joints were not able to hold in place. Basically, the tail would be disarticulated if we transferred the data from the model to life.”\n\nThe results puzzled Conti, because Myhrvold and Currie had argued the tail should be able to surpass the speed of sound. But he wasn’t able to successfully run a motion simulation without significantly lowering the speed at which the digital tail was being whipped.\n\nHe was finally able to get the dino tail to whip without breaking by significantly lowering the speed. “It was like 30 meters per second, so it’s not so slow, it’s like 100 kilometers per hour,” he said. That speed (roughly 69 miles per hour) is fast, but nowhere near the speed of sound.\n\nSimone Conti's model of a diplodocid tail.\n\nConti and his colleagues also examined the possibility of adding the fringed “popper” hypothesized by Myrhvold and Currie at the tip of the tail, even though no fossil evidence of such a tail tip has been found. That didn’t work. Neither did playing with the size of the tail or adding more tissue to its base.\n\nUltimately, Conti concluded in the new paper that the problem was the previous models, both metallic and computer-simulated, didn’t reflect the realities of what a dinosaur’s body could achieve, or withstand. “They have built this amazing metallic model of aluminum and steel, but the real problem is that organic materials are not able to sustain the same stresses that aluminum or even steel are able to sustain.”\n\nA new start for tail research\n\nDespite not being able to produce a sonic boom, Conti said it’s still plausible that a diplodocid’s tail would have been a useful tool in a fight and may have been used defensively.\n\nVerónica Díez Díaz, a paleontologist at Berlin’s Museum für Naturkunde who was not involved with either Currie’s or Conti’s studies, said the new research is “amazing,” especially as it pertains to her work in dinosaur biomechanics. “Tails in general for dinosaurs have been somehow neglected in the biomechanical studies,” she said, and with the analyses in Conti’s paper, “now we have something more experimental.”\n\nMyhrvold is far less complimentary. “They have no ‘findings’ of any value. Their model was not driven properly to demonstrate a cracking whip. So, what they proved is that they do not know how to model a bullwhip,” said Myhrvold, who told CNN he plans to respond to Conti’s paper with an updated model of his own.\n\nCurrie maintains it’s still possible that a dinosaur tail could have moved at sound barrier-breaking speeds, perhaps thanks to stronger skin or other soft tissues at the tip of the tail that paleontologists have yet to discover. However, he emphasized that the scientific process depends on researchers exploring and testing each other’s work; their conflicting findings ladder up to a better understanding of life on Earth.\n\n“It’s important because we really don’t have a good sense of all of the specializations that dinosaurs got into,” he said. “Dinosaurs did some absolutely amazing things. And if we want to answer the big questions, sometimes you’ve got to answer the small questions as well.”", "authors": ["Kate Golembiewski"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}]}

It usually causes fever and throat infections, and many people carry it without any symptoms. However, they can still spread it to others through coughs, sneezes and close contact.\n\nSymptoms of infection include pain when swallowing, fever, skin rashes and swollen tonsils and glands, with infection common in crowded settings such as schools and daycare centers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its website.\n\n“(Infection) tends to be fairly harmless,” Beate Kampmann, professor of Paediatric Infection & Immunity, and director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said in a statement on Friday.\n\n“(But) in very rare circumstances when the bacterium produces a toxin it can gain access to the bloodstream and cause really serious illness” such as sepsis, heart inflammation and toxic shock with organ failure, she said.\n\nShe advised parents to seek medical advice immediately if a child looks “very ill” with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, muscle aches or a rash.\n\nTo confirm a Strep A infection, clinicians usually either use a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or a throat culture, according to the CDC. A culture is when a sample such as mucus or skin is taken from a person and tested to see if it contains a bacterial infection, like Strep A. Due to the varying sensitivities of RADTs, a throat culture is the preferred diagnostic test.\n\nSimilarly in the UK, infections are typically diagnosed with a culture taken from the infected site – for example, the throat, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).\n\nUsually treatable with antibiotics\n\nInvasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) is the term used when the bacteria invade the body, overcoming its natural defenses to enter areas such as the blood, and is more dangerous, the UKHSA explains on its website.\n\nWhile there is no vaccine to prevent Strep A or iGAS infections, antibiotics are usually effective at treating them.\n\n“We are seeing a higher number of cases of Group A strep this year than usual,” Colin Brown, deputy director at UKHSA, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe increase in iGAS this year has particularly been observed in children under 10, the UKHSA added. Five children have died in England. One death has been reported in Wales, according to Public Health Wales.\n\nData from UKHSA shows that there were 2.3 cases per 100,000 children aged 1 to 4 between mid-September and mid-November, compared with the average of 0.5 in the pre-pandemic seasons (2017 to 2019).\n\nFor children aged 5 to 9, there were 1.1 cases per 100,000, compared with the pre-pandemic average of 0.3.\n\nThe last period of high infections was between 2017 to 2018, with four children under 10 dying in the equivalent period, the statement added.\n\nThe UKHSA said it doesn’t believe a new strain is circulating, with the increase in infections likely a result of “circulating bacteria and social mixing.”", "authors": ["Hafsa Khalil"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/health/cdc-covid-guidance/index.html", "title": "CDC expected to ease Covid-19 recommendations, including for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to update its guidance for Covid-19 control in the community, including in schools, in the coming days, according to sources familiar with the plan.\n\nA preview of the plans obtained by CNN shows that the updated recommendations are expected to ease quarantine recommendations for people exposed to the virus and de-emphasize 6 feet of social distancing.\n\nThe agency is also expected to de-emphasize regular screening testing for Covid-19 in schools as a way to monitor the spread of the virus, according to sources who were briefed on the agency’s plans but were not authorized to speak to a reporter. Instead, it says it may be more useful to base testing on Covid-19 community levels and whether settings are higher-risk, such as nursing homes or prisons.\n\nThe changes, which may be publicly released as early as this week, were previewed to educators and public health officials. They are still being deliberated and are not final.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the agency said, “The CDC is always evaluating our guidance as science changes and will update the public as it occurs.”\n\nAs part of the expected changes, the CDC would also soon remove a recommendation that students exposed to Covid-19 take regular tests to stay in the classroom. The strategy, called “test to stay,” was recommended by the agency in December, during the first Omicron wave, to keep unvaccinated kids who were exposed but didn’t have symptoms in the classroom instead of quarantining at home.\n\nTest-to-stay was resource-intensive for schools, and some districts had voiced concerns about having enough money to continue, one source said.\n\nIn schools and beyond, the agency will no longer recommend staying at least 6 feet away from other people as a protective measure. Instead, the new guidelines aim to help people understand which kinds of settings are riskier than others because of things like poor ventilation, crowds and personal characteristics like age and underlying health.\n\nThe CDC is also set to ease quarantine requirements for people who are unvaccinated or who are not up to date on their Covid-19 vaccines. Currently, the agency recommends that people who aren’t up to date on their shots stay at home for at least five days after close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid-19. Going forward, they won’t have to stay at home but should wear a mask and test at least five days after exposure.\n\nPeople who are sick with Covid-19 should still isolate, the agency is expected to say.\n\nThe agency also plans to re-emphasize the importance of building ventilation as a way to help stop the spread of many respiratory diseases, not just Covid-19. It plans to encourage schools to do more to clean and refresh their indoor air.\n\nSources say the tweaks reflect both shifting public sentiment toward the pandemic – many Americans have stopped wearing masks or social distancing – and a high level of underlying immunity in the population. Screening of blood samples suggests that as December, 95% of Americans have had Covid-19 or been vaccinated against it, reducing the chances of becoming severely ill or dying if they get it again.\n\nThe CDC’s recommendations are not legally binding. Many cities, states and school districts will review them but may ultimately follow different strategies.\n\nOne example of this is masks in schools.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMore than 200 million people – about 60% of the total population – live in a county with a “high Covid-19 community level” where the CDC warns of a risk of strain on the health care system and recommends universal indoor masking.\n\nYet most schools have kept masks optional for students this year. Among the top 500 K-12 school districts, based on enrollment, about 98% do not require masks, according to the data company Burbio’s school policy tracker.\n\nStill, the agency’s guidance continues to be important as a baseline.

TB is a disease spread through the air from one person to another. While a lot of work has been done to control and cure TB within the US, people still get sick and die from it every year. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, TB is the top infectious disease killer worldwide.\n\nThis year the Centers for Disease Control selected the theme “Find TB. Treat TB. Working together to eliminate TB.” This highlights that it takes an entire community of people working together to end the spread of TB disease. It also reveals the sad fact that TB is still a life-threatening problem and current efforts to find and treat TB disease are not enough. A united effort is needed to identify new strategies to improve testing and treatment options.\n\nThe good news is we don’t have to fight TB alone. There are things you can do to help protect those most vulnerable.\n\nGet tested for TB if you have spent time with someone who has TB disease, you have HIV infection or a medical problem that weakens the immune system, you have symptoms of TB disease such as fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss, you are from or have spent time in a country where TB disease is common such as Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia, and you live or work where you may be exposed to the disease such as homeless shelters, jails or some nursing homes.\n\nAnother way to prevent the spread of TB disease is to complete treatment for Latent TB Infection. Latent TB Infection is when you have tested positive for the TB germ but are not presently spreading the illness. This treatment will decrease your risk of progressing to active TB disease in your lifetime and decreases your need for lengthy and difficult treatment for TB disease in the future. It will also decrease the chance that you will make other people sick with TB disease later in your life.\n\nIf you are want to learn more about TB visit www.cdc.gov/tb.

I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’\n\n“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”\n\nStrathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nWhat she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.\n\nThen she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.\n\nNext, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.\n\nYet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.\n\nTheir story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.\n\n“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28 - Source: CNN How this 'perfect predator' saved his life after nine months in the hospital 04:28\n\nA terrifying vacation\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.\n\nFound in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”\n\n“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”\n\nToday, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.\n\n“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”\n\nWith the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”\n\nPatterson's body was systemically infected with a virulent drug-resistant bacteria that also infected troops in the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname \"Iraqibacter.\" Steffanie Strathdee\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack\n\nAfter that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nA phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.\n\n“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”\n\nBuoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.\n\nOne stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.\n\n“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”\n\n‘No problem’\n\nWhile the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.\n\nBut the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”\n\nIn fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.\n\nDr. Robert \"Chip\" Schooley (left) and Dr. Randy Taplitz after injecting Patterson with the first round of phages at UC San Diego Medical Center. Carly DeMento\n\nBack in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.\n\n“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”\n\nPurifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”\n\nMore hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.\n\n“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.\n\n“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”\n\n‘It was just miraculous’\n\nThe purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.\n\n“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”\n\nTwo days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.\n\n“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\n“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”\n\nPatterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee\n\nDamaged but not broken\n\nToday, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.\n\n“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.\n\n“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”\n\nTo prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.\n\n“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.\n\n“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”\n\nA legacy\n\n\"The Perfect Predator\" is a blow-by-blow account by the couple of the fight to save Patterson's life. Hachette Books\n\nPatterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.\n\n“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.\n\nSome of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.\n\n“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.\n\nIn San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.\n\nSchooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.\n\nAnd a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19 - Source: CNN How naturally occurring viruses could help treat superbug infections 23:19\n\n“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”\n\nStrathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.\n\n“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’\n\n“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/novavax-fda-eua-request/index.html", "title": "Novavax seeks FDA emergency use authorization of its coronavirus ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNovavax announced Monday that it has formally submitted a request for the US Food and Drug Administration to authorize its coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in the United States.\n\nThe request is based on data that includes the results of two large clinical trials that demonstrated an overall efficacy of about 90% and a “reassuring safety profile,” according to the company.\n\n“We believe our vaccine offers a differentiated option built on a well-understood protein-based vaccine platform that can be an alternative to the portfolio of available vaccines to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic,” Stanley Erck, Novavax’s president and chief executive officer, said in the announcement Monday.\n\nNovavax announced in June that its vaccine candidate was found to have an overall efficacy of 90.4% in a Phase 3 trial conducted across the United States and Mexico; the trial took place before the Omicron variant dominated in the United States.\n\nIn December, the company said it had finished its final submission package to the FDA for emergency use authorization of the vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373.\n\nThe vaccine can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius (about 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), and has a shelf life of about nine months, according to the company. Erck told CNN in November that if the FDA gives the green light for the EUA, the first 100 million doses of the protein-based vaccine will be ready to ship.\n\nNovavax’s vaccine – administered as two doses, three weeks apart – is made using small, laboratory-built pieces of the coronavirus to stimulate immunity, a more traditional approach for vaccine development that some people may be more familiar or comfortable with, compared with the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.\n\n“In the US, the primary market I think in 2022 is going to be to supply a vaccine, our normal two-dose regimen, to a lot of people who have been hesitant to get other vaccines,” Erck said in November. “And to provide a booster.”\n\nNovavax’s coronavirus vaccine relies on recombinant nanoparticle technology and Novavax’s adjuvant, called Matrix-M, to stimulate an immune response and high levels of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nWhen the genetic sequence for the coronavirus was first published, Novavax scientists identified the gene for the spike protein and created a modified version of that gene.

Our limited newsletter series guides you on lifestyle changes to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou probably know that composting banana peels and eggshells can help reduce your negative impact on the environment. But did you know that, once you die, you can do that with your body, too?\n\nHuman composting — also known as natural organic reduction or the reduction of human remains — is the practice of placing a dead body in a reusable vessel with biodegradable materials that foster the transformation into nutrient-dense soil that can be returned to loved ones or donated to conservation land.\n\nThe notion of going green even in death might sound far-fetched, but California has become the latest state to sign a human composting bill into law, set to go into effect in 2027. Washington became the first state to legalize human composting in 2019, followed by Oregon, Colorado and Vermont.\n\nAdvocates of human composting hope it can help slow the climate crisis driven by burning fossil fuels that produce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Cremations require lots of fuel — cremating one corpse emits an estimated 418 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, the equivalent of driving 470 miles in a car, according to Chemical & Engineering News, a publication of the American Chemical Society. In the United States, cremations account for 1.74 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to Green Burial Council Inc., an organization that oversees certification standards for cemeteries, funeral homes and product providers engaged in sustainable burial practices.\n\n“Human composting … uses much less energy than cremation, which uses fossil gas to create heat of over 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit,” said Katrina Spade, founder and CEO of Recompose, a licensed green funeral home in Seattle. “When human composting transforms the organic material of our bodies, carbon is also sequestered in the soil created. Rather than being released as carbon dioxide gas through exhaust during a cremation, the carbon matter contained in each body returns to the earth.”\n\nCristina Garcia, the California Assembly member who introduced the state legislation, said wildfires and extreme drought are reminders that climate change is real, and that methane and carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. “For each individual who chooses (natural organic reduction) over conventional burial or cremation, the process saves the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon from entering the environment,” Garcia said in a September news release.\n\nRecompose, Spade’s company, became the first human composting facility in the US when it opened in December 2020. Spade thought of human composting in graduate school after learning about livestock mortality composting, when farm animals are recycled back to the land, she said.\n\nHuman composting happens in steel cylinders known as vessels at Recompose. Sabel Roizen\n\nThe industry is new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials, cremation or green burials. And the process isn’t carbon-free since it still involves machinery operated by electricity and transportation of bodies, materials and remains, said Ed Bixby, president of the Green Burial Council.\n\nAs interest in more sustainable end-of-life options grows, transparency about the practice is crucial, Bixby said. A recent National Funeral Directors Association survey that found 60.5% of respondents were interested in exploring “green” funeral options because of potential environmental benefits, cost savings or other reasons.\n\n“With our families, we never want them to be disturbed or upset believing something that isn’t,” Bixby said. “If you’re going to do something, if it’s environmentally conscious, we think that’s wonderful. But we want to be sure that people understand what they’re buying into.”\n\nReducing death’s environmental and financial impact\n\nAt Recompose, human composting happens in a steel cylinder that’s 8 feet long and 4 feet tall, Spade said. A body is placed in the vessel on a bed of wood chips, alfalfa and straw.\n\n“Human composting creates an environment in which beneficial microbes thrive, with a specific moisture content and ratio of carbon and nitrogen materials,” Spade said.\n\nOver the next 30 days, everything inside naturally decomposes. One body creates a cubic yard of soil amendment — a substance added to soil to improve its texture or health — which is removed from the vessel and cured for two to six weeks. Afterward, it can be donated to conservation projects, or a certain amount can be returned to loved ones. But the amount loved ones receive can depend on what a state allows since the soil would still be legally considered human remains with regulations on what people can do with them, Bixby said.\n\nThe practice also avoids the introduction of nonbiodegradable materials — such as concrete or plastic vaults, steel caskets or lacquers — to the atmosphere or land, and forest depletion for wood caskets, Bixby said. Human composting would also protect funeral home workers from exposure to high levels of formaldehyde, which has been found to cause myeloid leukemia and rare cancers.\n\nHuman composting could lower the financial footprint of end-of-life arrangements, too. The median cost of a funeral with cremation in the US in 2021 was $6,971, and the median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. But the median burial estimate doesn’t include a plot, headstone or other cemetery costs associated with a traditional burial, which can often double the cost, Spade said.\n\n“Recompose strives to keep the price for human composting comparable to other death care options,” Spade said.\n\nRecompose has composted more than 200 corpses into soil since opening nearly two years ago and has more than 1,100 people signed up for Precompose, the company’s prearrangement program, Spade said.\n\n“We hear from our clients that knowing that their body — or that of their loved one — will be able to return to the earth is deeply comforting,” Spade said.\n\nNot everyone is eligible for human composting. Natural organic reduction destroys most harmful pathogens, but there are three rare diseases that disqualify a body from undergoing human composting, Spade said: Ebola, tuberculosis and diseases caused by prions, which are abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that can cause abnormal folding of certain brain proteins.\n\nThe list of states allowing human composting may soon grow longer. A bill in New York state has passed both legislative houses and is on its way to the governor’s desk, Spade said. And in Massachusetts, state Reps. Jack Lewis and Natalie Higgins are leading a bill to legalize human composting there.\n\nMost funeral homes, however, might not be quick to adopt the practice, Bixby said. Once a permit is issued, direct cremation can be done the same day, he added. A burial typically takes three to five days, while human composting can take up to 120.\n\n“The problem I see, as far as this growing, is that you can’t do high volume,” Bixby said. “As long as this process is, having five or six (vessels) doesn’t do a lot of good. … As a businessman, my feeling is this really won’t gain much ground for that main reason.”\n\nHe added, “It doesn’t make a lot of practical sense. And I hate to make things about money because it shouldn’t be, but at the end of the day, when you’re providing a service, it has to be about the income because you have to keep the lights on.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/health/cdc-remote-work-khn-partner/index.html", "title": "CDC's remote-work policy may hinder efforts for agencywide reform ...", "text": "Earlier this year, top leadership at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began a monumental task: turning the sprawling, labyrinthine organization known for its highly specialized, academically focused scientific research into a sleek, flexible public health response agency primed to serve the American public. It’s an attempt to keep the CDC from repeating the mistakes it made while responding to covid-19.\n\nBut agency veterans, outside public health officials, and workplace organization experts said the current workplace structure could be a major barrier to that goal. Like directors before her, agency head Dr. Rochelle Walensky spends a considerable amount of time away from the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta. The agency has also embraced a workplace flexibility program that has allowed most of its scientists to stay remote.\n\nAs of October, 10,020 of the CDC’s 12,892 full-time employees — 78% of the full-time workforce — were allowed to work remotely all or part of the time, according to data that KHN obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nExperts said the lack of face-to-face work will likely be a substantial obstacle to the top leadership’s effort to overhaul the agency after its failures during the pandemic — a botched testing rollout, confusing safety guidance, the slow release of scientific research, and a loss of public trust.\n\nThey also wondered whether Walensky, who frequently works remotely while traveling, can bring about that change from afar and whether a virtual workforce might experience more challenges battling infectious diseases than one working together in person.\n\n“One of the things that a really strong new leader would do is they’d be visible, they’d be walking the halls, they’d have the open door,” said Pamela Hinds, a professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University. “That’s much harder to accomplish when nobody’s there.”\n\nKey to the effort to reform the CDC is changing its institutional culture, which the agency says is at the core of all its work — from how it interacts with other agencies to how it shares its research. Walensky has said the CDC needs to be faster and nimbler in the face of emergencies and more communicative, both internally and with the public.\n\nA flexible, responsive, and collaborative culture thrived not too long ago — during the Obama administration, when the agency handled crises such as the H1N1 flu pandemic and the Zika virus outbreak, said Dr. Stephen Cochi, who worked at the CDC for four decades before retiring this year. “I would like to see every effort made to try to restore that culture to the extent possible, because CDC will potentially lose some of its excellence if it can’t,” he said.\n\nChanges, such as the transition to a largely remote workforce and a ballooning bureaucracy, he said, made it “almost impossible to get anything done” in his later years at the agency.\n\nChris Collins, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said that institutional culture includes “the unwritten rules of how work gets done” and that those are hard to learn in a remote work environment.\n\nA largely remote workplace, Collins said, can lead to weaker social connections among staffers, which can ultimately result in less understanding of and investment in the institution’s values. A loss of personal interaction can also suppress innovation. “If you believe great new ideas come from people bumping ideas up against each other, you want to try and create an environment where that happens as often as possible,” he said.\n\nA document that outlines the CDC’s policy and that was last updated in April says remote work can help recruit and retain staffers, keep workers happy, and reduce the cost of leased office space. It followed updated guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management encouraging agencies across the federal government to consider remote work options for staff, considering their utility during the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAs of early 2020, much of the workforce of the FDA and the National Institutes of Health was working remotely. Today, the NIH is mostly back in the office, but the FDA said many of its employees continue to work remotely when possible. And while the White House COVID-19 Task Force huddled in the early days of the pandemic and held in-person news conferences, its briefings became largely remote events.\n\nStill, Walensky has recently faced pointed skepticism about the workforce flexibility policy from lawmakers, who questioned her ability to remake the CDC with a dispersed staff.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing in September, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) quoted remarks that a former acting CDC director had made to The New York Times: “‘I don’t know how you motivate and inspire culture change when people aren’t together.’”\n\n“People at the CDC are working well, they’re working hard, and they don’t necessarily need to be on-site in Atlanta,” Walensky responded. “In fact, oftentimes, they’re more productive off-site.”\n\nWalensky added that agency staff deployments are common and that many lab staffers, who can’t work from home, are reporting to CDC offices.\n\nLeading the agency also isn’t a traditional office job.\n\n“The role of CDC director has historically involved a significant amount of official travel around the globe; requiring the director to be mobile and able to work from anywhere,” Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesperson, said in a statement. “Dr. Walensky splits her time between CDC domestic sites around the country, Washington, D.C., state health departments, and internationally where CDC has a presence in 60 countries.”\n\nKHN spoke with multiple CDC employees working remotely. They declined to speak on the record because of concerns about job security.\n\nThey said the remote work policy had no impact on their work but acknowledged that reduced opportunities for in-person interaction could make some CDC staff members feel less connected to their managers and peers — and to the agency’s mission.\n\nThat lack of personal connection can lead to a lack of trust, which can keep important conversations from happening, said Hinds, the Stanford professor. “We’re much more willing to be open, ask difficult questions, bring up problems when we have actually sat down with somebody face-to-face and gotten to know them a little bit better,” she said.\n\nA remote work environment also makes it harder for an incoming leader who has no experience inside an organization to truly understand its quirks, Hinds said. Walensky was an external hire and worked at Massachusetts General Hospital before her appointment as CDC director. And booking time for a video or phone call with a new boss to help them learn about an institution is “a big hurdle,” Hinds said, compared with bumping into them in the hallway or at the coffee cart.\n\nIn her early days working at the CDC, Dr. Anne Schuchat said, she relished informal interactions with co-workers and called such unscheduled time creative and productive. “I think you lose some things when you don’t have the informal mentoring and the visibility, perhaps the greater sensitivity to who’s struggling, who needs help,” Schuchat said.\n\nShe spent more than three decades at the agency, including two stints as acting director, before retiring in summer 2021. Her departure came on the heels of that of another high-level CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier.\n\nSchuchat said that working remotely part time was encouraged at the CDC before the pandemic because of a lack of office space. She said she imagined that many staffers were indeed more productive while working remotely, despite the possible costs to the agency’s culture.\n\nMany people have fled the U.S. public health workforce in recent years, burned out from the covid-19 response. Public health experts said that keeping talent requires offering benefits such as remote work — especially when it’s hard to offer competitive salaries — and getting staffers to believe in an agency’s mission.\n\nBut, the experts said, in-person interactions can lead to strong allegiances and investment in an organization, which can translate to better retention.\n\n“They generally want to feel like their work is important and that they’re valued,” said Dr. Manisha Juthani, who has led the Connecticut Department of Public Health since July 2021. “And the workplace allows for that a little bit more so than just sitting in front of the computer.”\n\nWalensky has said that transforming the CDC’s culture from one that’s methodical and academic to one that’s focused on quick action won’t be easy. Other experts agree on the need for the pivot.\n\n“They tend to be an agency that studies things and then, in their own sweet time, responds, versus being an emergency response agency,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverhauling that culture will be a big challenge, with high stakes, for the agency tasked with protecting the public health of all Americans. Benjamin said the CDC would likely have made its pandemic stumbles even if staffers hadn’t been working remotely. But coming to terms with those mistakes — and rebuilding the agency to keep them from happening in the future — could be easier and more sustainable if more people were working together in person, he said.\n\n“How do you become part of a culture, how do you become part of a holistic organization, if you’re not together?” he said. “While I’m not disturbed that they’re not back, my advice is to get there as quickly as they can.”", "authors": ["Sam Whitehead"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/", "title": "Inside America's Secretive Biolabs | USA Today", "text": "Alison Young and Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY\n\nVials of bioterror bacteria have gone missing. Lab mice infected with deadly viruses have escaped, and wild rodents have been found making nests with research waste. Cattle infected in a university's vaccine experiments were repeatedly sent to slaughter and their meat sold for human consumption. Gear meant to protect lab workers from lethal viruses such as Ebola and bird flu has failed, repeatedly.\n\nA USA TODAY Network investigation reveals that hundreds of lab mistakes, safety violations and near-miss incidents have occurred in biological laboratories coast to coast in recent years, putting scientists, their colleagues and sometimes even the public at risk.\n\nOversight of biological research labs is fragmented, often secretive and largely self-policing, the investigation found. And even when research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security breaches — as more than 100 labs have — federal regulators keep their names secret.\n\nOf particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working with the world's most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs — the two highest levels of containment that have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Yet there is no publicly available list of these labs, and the scope of their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state health departments charged with responding to disease outbreaks. Even the federal government doesn't know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office has warned for years.\n\nA team of reporters who work for the USA TODAY Network of Gannett newspapers and TV stations identified more than 200 of these high-containment lab facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia operated by government agencies, universities and private companies. They're scattered across the country from the heart of New York City to a valley in Montana; from an area near Seattle's Space Needle to just a few blocks from Kansas City's Country Club Plaza restaurant and shopping district.\n\nHigh-profile lab accidents last year with anthrax, Ebola and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the discovery of forgotten vials of deadly smallpox virus at the National Institutes of Health raised widespread concerns about lab safety and security nationwide and whether current oversight is adequate to protect workers and the public. Wednesday the Department of Defense disclosed one of its labs in Utah mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax -- instead of killed specimens – to labs across the USA plus a military base in South Korea where 22 people are now being treated with antibiotics because of their potential exposure to the bioterror pathogen. As many as 18 labs in nine states received the samples, the CDC said Thursday.\n\n\"What the CDC incidents showed us ... is that the very best labs are not perfectly safe,\" says Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology. \"If it can happen there, it certainly can happen anywhere.\"\n\nSome people find little reassurance that nobody was sickened in the CDC accidents or in the historically low numbers of serious infections among lab workers generally, or that infections spreading into communities surrounding labs have been rarer still.\n\n\"Many of us think that's really a matter of good fortune,\" said Beth Willis, who chairs a citizen lab advisory panel in Frederick, Md., home to one of the nation's largest high-containment research campuses at the Army's Fort Detrick.\n\nThe country's best labs have robust safety programs, said Kenneth Berns, co-chair of a panel of outside lab safety advisers currently examining biosafety at CDC and other federal labs. Yet the systemic safety problems identified at the CDC's prestigious labs have raised questions about what's happening elsewhere. \"It's a matter of some concern,\" said Berns, a distinguished professor emeritus of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida.\n\nThe consequences could be devastating if accidents were to occur with lab-created strains of deadly influenza viruses that are purposely engineered to be easier to spread than what's found in nature, said David Relman, a microbiology professor at Stanford University who is a federal adviser on lab safety and a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"You're talking about something that has the ability to take off, and we could not be confident of being able to contain it,\" he said.\n\nRelman said that not enough is known about the state of safety at labs that perform infectious disease research but emphasized that the kinds of labs drawing concern are the same ones the public needs to discover important new treatments and vaccines. \"We have to find some happy blend of minimized risk and enhanced benefit,\" he said.\n\nAt the high-containment labs identified by USA TODAY, experiments are underway involving drug-resistant tuberculosis, exotic strains of flu, the SARS and MERS viruses, plague, anthrax, botulism, ricin and the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, according to interviews and more than 20,000 pages of internal lab safety records and incident reports obtained from labs across the country.\n\nStudies are also being done on a wide range of bioterrorism pathogens that are less known to the public, such as the agents that cause exotic diseases like tularemia, Q fever and melioidosis. Still others are focused on pathogens that pose serious economic risks to agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and \"mad cow\" disease.\n\nAt a few labs, experiments have been done with strains of flu and other viruses purposely made to be more dangerous in studies that seek to understand how they might mutate naturally. White House science advisers called for a temporary halt of that kind of \"gain of function\" research last fall while expert scientific panels spend the next year studying its risks and benefits.\n\nThe research at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs — which use special equipment, negative air pressure and numerous safety and security procedures — seeks to better understand how organisms cause disease and ways to protect against them. It's the kind of work that the public doesn't give much thought to until people with Ebola arrive on planes in the United States from an outbreak in Africa, or the current avian flu outbreak forces farmers to kill millions of chickens raising the specter of higher egg prices.\n\nIt's impossible to obtain a full accounting of lab accidents or lab-acquired infections because there is no universal, mandatory requirement for reporting them and no system to analyze trends to assess emerging biosafety risks and disseminate lessons learned on a regular basis.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program, which inspects and regulates the subset of research labs that experiment with about four dozen types of pathogens deemed to pose bioterror threats, requires labs to report potential exposure or release incidents, as well as thefts or losses of specimens.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2013, labs notified federal regulators of about 1,500 incidents with select agent pathogens and, in more than 800 cases, workers received medical treatment or evaluation, limited public data in program annual reports show. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections and there were three unintended infections of animals, according to the reports, which do not identify labs and mostly provide aggregated counts of incidents by type. Reported incidents involve events ranging from spills to failures of personal protective equipment or mechanical systems to needle sticks and animal bites.\n\nThe program, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, refuses to release copies of detailed incident reports, citing a 2002 bioterrorism law.\n\nIncident records the USA TODAY Network obtained directly from individual labs provide a window on the kinds of mistakes that happen. An animal caretaker in Georgia was potentially exposed to a bird flu virus that kills 60% of the people it infects when a defective respirator hose supplying purified air detached from its coupling in September. A researcher in Wisconsin was quarantined for seven days in 2013 after a needle stick with a version of the same H5N1 influenza virus. A lab worker in Colorado failed to ensure specimens of the deadly bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping them in May 2014 to a co-worker in a lower-level lab who handled them without critical protective gear. None of the workers was infected.\n\nThe public and the lab community tend to learn only about the rare instances of serious or fatal lab infections, which sometimes are published as case reports in scientific journals or make national news.\n\nIn 2009, Malcolm Casadaban, a University of Chicago scientist with an underlying medical condition, died from an infection with a weakened strain of plague bacteria. In 2012, 25-year-old researcher Richard Din died after being infected during vaccine research involving Neisseria meningitides bacteria at a lab inside San Francisco's VA medical center. Both of their deaths involved research in biosafety level 2 labs, where pathogens are considered to be less dangerous than those worked with in high-containment labs.\n\nDin, who became a researcher to cure diseases like the cancer that killed his mother, developed a fever and started feeling dizzy while out to dinner with friends. He had no idea how serious his symptoms were, his friends and family told USA TODAY. By morning, Din was covered in a splotchy rash and could barely talk, recalled Lawrence Tsai, who raced to Din's apartment to help.\n\nTsai carried his friend down two flights of stairs and drove him to the hospital. \"His body was very hard, very straight,\" Tsai said. \"Only his eyes were open. He could not say anything.\"\n\nA few hours later, Din was dead. And Tsai said he and his friends were told they, too, were at risk and needed to take antibiotics because of their close contact with him. The bacteria that killed Din can spread from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. About two dozen emergency room workers also were treated with antibiotics as a precaution, according to a presentation about the case at a scientific conference. Nobody else was sickened.\n\nFederal workplace safety investigators, who investigated because the case involved a death, said Din died because the VA failed to adequately supervise and protect workers in the research lab. Among the \"serious\" issues they cited: Din and other workers in the lab were manipulating specimens of the dangerous bacteria out on tabletops — not inside protective biosafety cabinets that would have reduced potential exposures to droplets or splashes. The lab also failed to train workers about warning signs of infection, violation records show.\n\nAlthough lab-created outbreaks that spread to people or animals in the surrounding community are rare, they have happened.\n\n\"That's what you would worry about,\" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, of the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent think tank that studies biosecurity and epidemics. \"But even then the consequences up to now have been limited to the very close contacts of the person who was infected.\"\n\nA small, deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2004 was traced to lab workers at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. In 2007, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease among cattle in England that required herds to be slaughtered was blamed on leaking drainage pipes at a nearby research complex.\n\nIn Louisiana, tests are underway to make sure a deadly bioterror bacterium hasn't colonized the soil and water around the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans. Late last year, the bacteria got out of one of the center's BSL-3 labs, likely hitching a ride on workers' clothing, sickening two monkeys that lived in outdoor cages and later infecting others. Tulane will spend the next five years testing its outdoor monkey colony as well as wildlife and feral cats around the 500-acre facility to ensure the bacteria haven't contaminated the environment. The CDC and Tulane say they think the bacteria spread only inside the center's buildings, and so far tests outdoors have not detected the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause severe and difficult-to-treat illness in people and animals infected by coming into contact with contaminated soil or water.\n\nOn a global scale, a lab accident is considered by many scientists to be the likely explanation for how an H1N1 flu strain re-emerged in 1977 that was so genetically similar to one that had disappeared before 1957 it looked as if it had been \"preserved\" over the decades. The re-emergence \"was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source,\" according to a 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHowever, most pathogens studied in labs, unlike the flu, don't spread easily from person to person. Often, to become infected a person needs to have direct contact with a pathogen, which is why lab workers are most at risk, experts said. For example, people can become infected with anthrax by inhaling the bacterium's spores, but once sickened they are not contagious, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think the public needs to be too concerned,\" said Marian Downing, president of the American Biological Safety Association. \"There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place.\"\n\nBeyond accidental lab-associated outbreaks, federal auditors consider the deliberate theft and misuse of a deadly pathogen to be one of the most significant risks of biolab research. That's what the FBI says happened in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17. Bruce Ivins, a biologist and anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Md., was the perpetrator, the FBI concluded.\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has issued repeated warnings since 2007 that the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased the aggregate risk of accidental or intentional releases of viruses, bacteria or toxins.\n\nNo single agency tracks the overall number or location of these labs, the GAO has said. Little is known about high-containment labs working with dangerous pathogens such as tuberculosis, the MERS virus and others that aren't on the select agent list and tracked by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nNational standards for constructing and operating these kinds of labs are lacking, which means labs vary by local building requirements. While voluntary guidance exists for safe lab design and operations, the GAO has found it is not universally followed.\n\nThe documents obtained by USA TODAY show power failures at BSL-3 labs at Texas A&M University repeatedly resulted in the labs losing their negative air pressure during 2013, a key safety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. The CDC's labs in Atlanta also have had airflow problems over the years, the newspaper previously reported.\n\n\"The public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have disastrous consequences,\" the GAO's Nancy Kingsbury told Congress at a hearing on the CDC lab incidents last summer.\n\nLab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program — whose departments often fund the research they oversee — would not grant interviews despite repeated requests since last year. The program oversees about 262 organizations that operate BSL-3 and eight organizations that operate BSL-4 labs.\n\nThe two federal agencies that jointly run the program — the CDC and USDA — operate their own labs, which have been involved in recent high-profile incidents.\n\n\"We believe the current system of inspecting/overseeing laboratories is adequate, but we are always open to continued improvements,\" the CDC said in an emailed statement. USDA officials also declined to be interviewed.\n\nLab safety officials at the National Institutes of Health, a major research funding agency that operates its own labs and helps set national biosafety guidelines, also declined interview requests.\n\n\"There is no 'zero-risk' proposition in the conduct of research,\" the agency said in a statement. \"NIH works extremely hard to minimize all research-related risks.\"\n\nMore than 100 labs experimenting with potential bioterror agents have been cited by regulators at the CDC and USDA for serious safety and security failings since 2003, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nYet so much of select agent oversight is cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to assess regulators' effectiveness in ensuring safety. In several instances, troubled labs and even federal regulators appeared to misrepresent the significance of the government's enforcement efforts.\n\nSince 2003, the CDC has referred 79 labs for potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. It has levied fines against 19 of them totaling more than $2.4 million, the CDC said in response to questions.\n\nSome are repeat offenders. Five labs have had \"multiple referrals\" for enforcement actions, the CDC said. Two labs have been kicked out of the program, and five labs have been suspended from doing any select agent research, the agency said.\n\nWhich labs repeatedly failed to address safety problems? The CDC won't name names — not even for the two labs kicked out of the select agent program. The CDC and its regulatory partners at the USDA say the 2002 bioterrorism law requires keeping this information secret.\n\nYet earlier this year, the CDC publicly announced its suspension of the Tulane National Primate Research Center — after the center's accidental release of a bioterror bacterium became publicly known and was the subject of news reports. The CDC said it balances the public's right to transparency with the risk posed by information being made available to those who might use it to threaten public health or security.\n\nCurrently seven labs are under the extra scrutiny of a federal select agent lab performance improvement program, the CDC said. The program is offered as a voluntary alternative to suspension or other regulatory action, the agency said, for labs with a \"repeated failure to correct past observation, biosafety and security concerns\" or failures to comply with extra security requirements for work with \"Tier 1\" select agents. Tier 1 agents are those deemed to pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating economic effects.\n\nWhile under scrutiny of the program, an individual researcher or project must halt the research that has been found in violation, but other select agent research at the institution generally is allowed to continue, the CDC said.\n\nThirty-three labs have been put on performance improvement programs since 2008, CDC said. Their names are secret too.\n\nDozens more labs have faced regulatory actions from the USDA, which takes the lead overseeing select agent labs primarily working with animal or agricultural pathogens. The USDA says it has conducted 48 investigations that have resulted in $116,750 in fines.\n\nThe USDA said all of its enforcement records about these fines are required to be kept secret because of the 2002 bioterrorism law. The USDA did release a spreadsheet it says documents its actions, but the agency redacted almost all the information on it: lab names, violation types and even dates. Only a few references to warning letters and fines were spared the agency's black marker.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program says no law or regulation bars the labs themselves from discussing their select agent research. And universities and other research institutions routinely publish their research on select agent pathogens in scientific journals.\n\nRegistered labs just aren't supposed to share details of specific security measures, such as locations of keys and codes, that would give access to pathogens. The CDC and USDA said there is nothing that prohibits labs from releasing information or answering questions about any regulatory problems they've had. Yet few were willing to readilydiscuss violations or failed inspections.\n\nLabs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa are among those in the federal performance improvement program, at least as of January, records obtained by USA TODAY show. Although the secrecy provisions of the 2002 bioterrorism law apply only to certain federal agencies, officials at the state-run university cited that law among its reasons for denying requests for records about safety violations and the performance improvement program.\n\nThe university inadvertently confirmed that its Honolulu labs had been put in the performance improvement program in records it filed in January with Hawaii's Office of Information Practices, which is deciding USA TODAY's public records appeal. The university wrote that being put on a PIP is something it is \"proud\" of.\n\n\"We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,\" the university wrote to the appeals agency, adding that it \"has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.\"\n\nUniversity of Hawaii officials declined to be interviewed.\n\nLast year, two labs agreed to pay fines handed down by the HHS Office of Inspector General for select agent violations, records show.\n\nA lab that federal officials would describe only as an \"Arizona research university\" agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens they worked with. The lab, the USA TODAY Network's reporting found, was Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Lab director Paul Keim said the issues date back to 2010 when the university had difficulty keeping up with changing federal regulations. Since then the university's labs have passed several inspections, he said.\n\nAn unnamed Florida laboratory agreed to pay $50,000 to resolve violations that included failing to ensure accurate inventories of select agents and failing to notify the CDC and appropriate law enforcement agencies after discovering a missing select agent.\n\nThe inspector general's office, citing regulations stemming from the 2002 bioterrorism law, redacted the names of these labs, as well as all other labs receiving fines, in documents it provided to USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Other labs that have been fined over the years for select agent violations are located in Alabama, California, Missouri, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, records show.\n\nAs a way of providing some oversight, Congress requires a report each year on the number of thefts, losses and releases of bioterror pathogens at labs regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nYet regulators provide scant details of their activities and the problems identified at labs. Usually just three pages long plus a cover page, the reports contain only aggregated counts of lab incidents by type, plus vague information on a few serious incidents.\n\nThe select agent program told Congress it had \"imposed a $425,000 civil money penalty\" on an unnamed lab where a serious biosafety lapse in 2008 had resulted in a cow in a nearby disease-free herd becoming infected with Brucella bacteria, which cause brucellosis.\n\nBrucellosis is a contagious and economically significant agricultural disease — which causes cattle and other livestock to abort their fetuses, produce less milk, suffer weight loss, infertility and lameness. It has been the subject of eradication efforts for decades.\n\nThe $425,000 fine would have been one of the largest in the overall select agent program's history — if it had actually been imposed.\n\nBut it wasn't imposed, USA TODAY's investigation found, and the USDA never corrected the record with Congress.\n\nUSA TODAY was able to identify the Brucella research program at Louisiana State University's AgCenter in Baton Rouge as the likely recipient of the $425,000 fine by examining USDA animal health reports that tallied what states reported brucellosis cases in 2008. Louisiana, which had a case that year, had been declared brucellosis-free in 2000.\n\nLSU officials spent months denying USA TODAY access to its records about the incident, citing among other things select agent regulations unrelated to the requested information. In statements and interviews, LSU downplayed its violations and provided information that was later contradicted by federal records.\n\n\"The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,\" LSU officials said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY.\n\nYet, in December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the incident investigation reports from the USDA and Louisiana's state agriculture department, the documents showed no uncertainty.\n\nUSDA records show that investigators documented serious violations. In levying the $425,000 fine, regulators cited LSU for failing to have adequate biosafety measures, resulting in the release of the bacteria that caused the cow's infection. The USDA also cited LSU for violating regulations by sending Brucella-infected cattle that had been part of select agent vaccine experiments to an unregistered slaughter facility where their meat was sold for human consumption.\n\nLSU's Phil Elzer, who at the time ran the Brucella studies and now is a university administrator, said in an interview the practice of sending research cattle to slaughter was declared in the lab's operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators. \"To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,\" Elzer said. LSU appealed, and the USDA eventually dropped the fine, he said.\n\nIn January 2010, records show, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed but reiterating the issues with the infected cow and the use of the unauthorized slaughter plant.\n\nUSDA officials acknowledge that they never imposed the $425,000 fine and made a mistake touting it in their report to Congress.\n\n\"It should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine,\" said Freeda Isaac, USDA's director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, in an emailed statement. Isaac added that the USDA suspended a portion of LSU's select agent registration because of the Brucella incident and \"that portion of the registration is still suspended,\" Isaac said last fall.\n\nFor those labs not in the select agent program — and even those that are — self-policing is the front line of biosafety. Biosafety committees at research institutions, often staffed by scientists' colleagues, assess the risks of proposed research and grant or deny approval for studies. Labs also have other safety staff who may do internal inspections and lab audits, plus additional committees overseeing the use of animals in research.\n\nYet some researchers appear ignorant of their institutions' biosafety rules. Others brazenly ignore repeated requests by biosafety staff to stop experiments and address issues.\n\nDocuments obtained by the USA TODAY Network include at least 50 incidents since 2012 in which researchers were conducting experiments with genetically manipulated organisms without proper approval from internal safety committees. In some cases, records show researchers flaunting their institutional rules.\n\n• At the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in, biosafety staff concluded in a 2013 report that the root causes of a researcher failing to get her experiments approved included \"general indifference of the investigator to institutional rules governing the need for biosafety compliance\" as well as a \"lack of oversight of research activities.\" The scientist, the investigation revealed, knowingly launched unapproved experiments — exposing mice to a genetically manipulated strain of Burkholderia thailandensis — in a quest to get a vaccine study manuscript published that reviewers said needed additional data. The research was halted after veterinarians found several cages containing dead and dying mice, yet none of the cages was labeled with the infectious agent and they were in an area not approved for experiments with a BSL-2 pathogen. The incident was \"an extremely unusual event,\" said Sheila Champlin, an assistant vice chancellor at the center, noting corrective actions were taken before the scientist was allowed to resume research.\n\n• At the University of Iowa, a biosafety officer in February 2014 discovered that a scientist had been conducting experiments with a genetically manipulated strain of the MERS virus since September 2013 without biosafety committee approval. The biosafety officer ordered the investigator to stop all experiments, and the scientist was put on probation and received increased safety monitoring. The work was being done in a BSL-3 lab at the time it was discovered, but started in a BSL-2 lab, the safety officer's investigation found. The university concluded that the scientist did not \"effectively communicate\" to his staff the importance of getting safety committee approval before starting the experiments with the virus, which can cause a deadly, contagious respiratory disease in people.\n\n• At the University of California-Irvine, a researcher ignored repeated notices from biosafety staff during 2012 and 2013 that a research project's approval had expired, that it needed further revisions and that all work must cease — yet the scientist continued the experiments with a lentivirus, anyway, in the BSL-2 lab. As a result of the incident, the university now sends researchers four notices starting 90 days before approvals expire, said James Hicks, the university's associate vice chancellor of research. As the deadline nears, Hicks is copied on the notices so he can intervene if necessary. \"We take a very strong view and a very correct view of the importance of following the regulations and the guidelines,\" he said in an interview.\n\n• At the University of Nebraska, a biosafety officer in 2013 found that a researcher had continued growing plants as part of an experiment using a transgenic tobacco rattle virus vector — despite being told repeatedly over two months that additional approval was needed from the biosafety committee before research could begin. As a result of the incident, the university said it revised its biosafety guidelines to describe consequences of unapproved research and sent a letter to faculty. \"This was an isolated instance that was fully and successfully resolved,\" the university said.\n\n• At the University of Hawaii-Manoa, biosafety staff discovered a scientist was doing a type of cancer research in 2012 despite being denied biosafety committee approval and being repeatedly told not to do the experiments. Separately, at a March 2013 biosafety committee meeting at the university, members discussed the need for penalties when researchers fail to comply with biosafety rules, stating \"there must be some consequence and corrective action other than an email\" to the scientist, the minutes say.\n\nLabs that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other federal agencies are required to report incidents to the NIH involving certain types of genetically engineered organisms and recombinant DNA technology. From 2010 through 2014, the NIH received 644 reports of lab incidents during this kind of research.\n\nMost of the reports the NIH receives are for what it says are non-serious incidents, such as small spills, splashes, cuts and equipment failures. Failure to obtain required biosafety committee approvals to do this type of research are among the more common types of non-compliance.\n\nAlthough it is not a regulatory agency, the NIH said in a statement that agency staff have made site visits to 100 institutions in recent years in an effort to help improve biosafety committee resources and adherence to the NIH Guidelines for operating their labs.\n\n\"Most instances of non-compliance result from a lack of full understanding of the requirements of the NIH Guidelines, rather than willful disregard, and our emphasis has been on corrective actions through education, which institutions seem uniformly responsive to,\" the NIH said.\n\nIn September 2014, the NIH contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had knowingly failed to report lab incidents as required, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told the NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to the NIH but should have been, the records show.\n\nThe records indicate that University of Louisville biosafety officials were aware of some of the unreported incidents as much as six months before the NIH opened its inquiry. William Pierce Jr., the university's executive vice president for research and innovation, in a statement to USA TODAY, said \"there was apparent confusion regarding the authority and responsibility for reporting violations to the NIH.\" Pierce said the university has hired an outside firm to oversee its biosafety committee and created training courses for scientists. \"We feel confident the current system is working,\" he said.\n\nThe NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency's questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future.\n\n\"In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance,\" the NIH said in response to USA TODAY's questions.\n\nFor some residents living near labs, the lack of transparency is frustrating — and worrisome. It's not enough to tell the public the labs have robust safety procedures. \"What people are really interested in is how well it's working,\" said Beth Willis, the citizen lab safety representative near Fort Detrick. \"The more people in the community feel that there's secrecy, the more they're distrustful, whether their distrust is warranted or not.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/02/amphibian-ranavirus-infection-delaware/9887847/", "title": "Killer ranavirus threatens frogs, turtles in Delaware", "text": "Molly Murray\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nA virus partially blamed for a worldwide amphibian decline has made its way to Delaware, killing tadpoles and raising fears it will spread to reptile species.\n\nThe ranavirus, a type of virus that affects cold-blooded species, has been found in wood frog tadpoles in all of Delaware's counties and eight in Maryland. And there is concern it could impact iconic reptile species like the Eastern box turtle or endangered species like the bog turtle.\n\n\"Of 23 Delaware ponds tested in 2013, ranavirus was detected in 14 – 61 percent – and amphibian die-offs were recorded for two of those during the sampling period,\" said Holly Niederriter, wildlife biologist with the state's Species Conservation and Research Program.\n\nIn addition, a dead bog turtle found three years ago in Delaware likely died from a predator attack but it was infected with ranavirus, herpes and mycoplasma, she said.\n\nTracking the potential impact on relatively secretive turtle species is difficult, why is why Niederriter has been out again this year re-sampling ponds. She is finding similar signs of the virus.\n\nShe said that infectious diseases such as ranavirus – which is likely spread by contact with water or sick or dead tadpoles – are a large cause of the worldwide amphibian decline.\n\nThe disease is found throughout the United States in both frogs and turtles but it has not been found in birds or mammals. With some tadpole frog species, the mortality rate is as high as 99 percent.\n\n\"The virus can also be spread via water, in soil and on the boots, nets and gear of humans,\" Niederriter said.\n\nThe ranavirus was identified in Maryland in 2001 in Prince George's County, said Scott Smith, a wildlife ecologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\nDelaware officials began looking for the disease in wooded ponds last year as part of a regional effort, prompted by a turtle die-off discovered as part of a study on the impact of a proposed new highway in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.\n\nA researcher at Towson University put radio transmitters on Eastern box turtles to see how they would fair if they were moved to new locations as part of a road construction mitigation project.\n\nBut the transmitters turned up something unexpected.\n\n\"They'd be sick one day and dead the next,\" Niederriter said.\n\nSmith said the researcher lost both his control site and his two test plots to ranavirus in the study that took place from 2008 to 2011.\n\nOne reason for the concern, Smith said, is that box turtles are long-lived and have reproductive strategy that differs from frogs. Frogs typically lay eggs in woodland ponds by the hundreds.\n\nBut box turtles, while laying several clutches of eggs, may only lay three to eight at a time.\n\nSmith said with frogs, especially wood frogs, the disease seems to have highest impact on the tadpoles but doesn't kill adults. That means the adults, which typically live five to eight years, can return to breed again the following year.\n\nThere are species, like bullfrogs, that appear more resistant to the disease, he said.\n\nSo far, researchers believe the disease in our area has the greatest impact on wood frogs and spotted salamanders. No one is certain how it spreads from pond to pond, though there is some thought that other wildlife may spread it, including bullfrogs, which can travel three miles to breeding pools.\n\nResearchers have found that one day a pond can seem fine and then the entire wood frog tadpole population can be wiped out in as little as five days.\n\nOver several days in late May, Niederriter and research assistant Christine Tilton set out to sample wood frog tadpoles.\n\nThe two scientists waded into slightly less than knee deep water at Blackbird State Forest. In March, they marked the areas where wood frogs laid their egg masses with orange survey tape.\n\nLast week, they took long-handled nets and swept through the leaves and water in the survey area, searching for inch-and-a-half long tadpoles.\n\nThey needed 30 animals, which they collected in a bucket and took back to a test site in a cleared area in the woods.\n\n\"They have to be a certain age,\" Niederriter explained. The telltale sign is that the tadpoles are starting to develop legs. At this stage of development, the tadpoles may even show signs of the disease – red splotches.\n\nFor this study, the tadpoles are killed with a numbing agent before being examined because they must be sent out to a lab for positive confirmation of the disease.\n\n\"This year we're finding die-offs in more of the ponds,\" Niederriter said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/perspectives/cvs-mental-health-business/index.html", "title": "Opinion: CVS Health CEO: It's time for business leaders to get ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Karen S. Lynch is the president and CEO of CVS Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nEven though mental health challenges aren’t anything new, we are living in a time with a series of unique stressors that are impacting every one of us, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as a pandemic that has stretched two-and-a-half years and continually reminds us that as much as we want to be done with it, we’re still living with a public health emergency that none of us has experienced in our lifetimes. It’s no wonder that people are reporting “alarming” levels of stress, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\nMental health challenges can truly impact anyone. I understand this on a personal level — my mother wasn’t able to get the help that she needed to address her struggles, and it tragically led to her taking her own life. Because of her experiences, I’m driven and committed to helping increase access to mental health services for everyone.\n\nMental health has been the collateral damage of the pandemic, but the uncertainty and social isolation of this time has at least raised awareness and increased our willingness to openly discuss things like depression, loneliness and burnout. A once hidden, private and even shameful topic, our mental health and the steps we take to preserve it has become a much more regular part of our daily lives, discourse and decisions.\n\nBut, even as we’ve learned to seek treatment for mental health challenges more readily, it’s clear that our needs are outpacing the growth of quality care solutions. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US among children and adults, with nearly 46,000 people dying by suicide in 2020.\n\nBoth the public and private sector have been taking steps to address this issue, with the federal government establishing the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, for instance. And CVS Health has committed to a goal of reducing suicide attempts by 20% among Aetna members by 2025 through a number of different approaches, including direct outreach to the families of high-risk youth, as well as partnering with outpatient programs uniquely focused on suicide prevention and risk reduction.\n\nWhile these are steps in the right direction, we also need to shift how we think about mental health — away from crises and toward mental well-being.\n\nBusiness leaders have a tremendous role to play here. They have an opportunity to not only do the right thing for their employees, but also serve as a catalyst for change in how mental health is recognized as an everyday health issue. Here are several ways that they can help move our collective mindset in that direction:\n\nBe transparent and open\n\nAs one of the country’s largest employers, we offer a number of resources to our colleagues to support their mental health at all stages. Our Resources for Living program is available to all of our employees and their families and provides varying levels of support for mental health, including stress reduction and help with crisis situations. But the quality of the resources only matters if we’re leading by example, talking about mental health issues directly with our employees and making sure they feel comfortable using the resources available to them.\n\nBusiness leaders should be comfortable talking openly with their employees about their own mental health, whether during a large team meeting or a one-on-one conversation. By taking that first step, they can demonstrate the importance of speaking openly about mental health and give employees the support needed to open up about their own experiences.\n\nIncrease access to mental health care\n\nBefore the pandemic, CVS Health had about 20,000 virtual mental health visits. In 2020 and 2021, we had 20 million. We need to continue to break down barriers so people can easily locate the right resources to get the care they need, whether that is virtual or in-person. This can also help reach populations, such as young adults, that might be more comfortable talking about these types of issues in a virtual setting.\n\nOf course not every company is in the health care industry, but every company will be impacted by health care and mental health in some way. The programs that we provide to our employees are available to anyone, but companies can also consider offering trainings like Mental Health First Aid or Talk Saves Lives, a program developed by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention that provides research on risks and prevention.\n\nEncourage peer support\n\nYour employees can be your greatest advocate in this area. In addition to offering colleague support groups that are facilitated by clinicians, we publish a quarterly mental well-being resource guide for our leaders and managers. Each issue of this guide covers a specific topic — such as addressing burnout with resilience or suicide prevention — and includes relevant articles, tools and tips to help leaders better understand the topic. We also recently introduced a program through Thrive Global to support employees’ physical, mental and emotional well-being. The Thrive platform will enable our colleagues to manage stress, improve focus, strengthen connections with others and support their overall well-being.\n\nAnother key approach to encouraging peer support is to provide a forum where employees can connect on shared experiences. We’ve set up a program to allow employees to voluntarily share inspiring stories on our company intranet site about how they’ve overcome their personal mental health challenges. These stories always generate an overwhelmingly positive response from across the organization.\n\nThis is the time for us to start building on the mental health awareness that the pandemic brought with it, and to make the most of our hard-won lessons. We need to take those everyday conversations about well-being and turn them into real action.", "authors": ["Opinion Karen S. Lynch For Cnn Business Perspectives"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

He served a single term as president from 1929 to 1933.\n\nOtto Frederick Rohwedder\n\nBorn: Davenport\n\nLifetime: 1880-1960\n\nWhat he's known for: The commercial bread-slicing machine\n\nIt would be inaccurate to say Otto Frederick Rohwedder invented the best thing since sliced bread since, well, Rohwedder effectively did invent sliced bread. In 1928, despite being a jeweler by trade and losing some of his initial plans in a Monmouth factory fire, Rohwedder created a device that sliced and wrapped loaves of bread.\n\nHarry Hopkins\n\nBorn: Sioux City\n\nLifetime: 1890-1946\n\nWhat he's famous for: Advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nBorn in Sioux City and a 1912 graduate of Grinnell College, Hopkins grew up to work on remedying the ripple effects of the Great Depression and become an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt. After Roosevelt became president in 1933, he named Hopkins the administrator of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and, when the United States entered World War II, Hopkins became a key figure in the efforts of the Allied powers. After surviving stomach cancer, Hopkins died due to liver failure months after receiving the Distinguished Service Medal from President Harry S. Truman.\n\nGrant Wood\n\nBorn: Anamosa\n\nLifetime: 1891-1942\n\nWhat he's known for: American painter who created \"American Gothic\"\n\nGrant Wood studied various art forms in France and Germany through the 1920s and went on to display his most recognizable work, \"American Gothic,\" in the Art Institute of Chicago in 1930. Wood went on to teach at the University of Iowa from 1935 to 1940, and during that time he instructed a young Elizabeth Catlett.\n\nW. Edwards Deming\n\nBorn: Sioux City\n\nLifetime: 1900-1993\n\nWhat he's famous for: Statistician and educator\n\nSioux City's William Edwards Deming made his way into the field of statistical analysis that he applied to achieve better industrial quality control. In the 1950s, Deming's skills helped Japan as the nation economically recovered from the fallout of World War II and became the namesake for The Deming Prize, an annual award given to Japanese corporations with exceptional quality control.\n\nMeredith Willson\n\nBorn: Mason City\n\nLifetime: 1902-1984\n\nWhat he's famous for: Composer of \"The Music Man\"\n\nRobert Meredith Willson was himself a music man from a young age when he began playing flute in the Mason City Municipal Band, setting him on track to begin his musical career. In 1958, Willson's musical \"The Music Man,\" the most widely known of his works, was given a Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nLeon 'Bix' Beiderbecke\n\nBorn: Davenport\n\nLifetime: 1903-1931\n\nWhat he's famous for: Jazz musician\n\nLeon Beiderbecke is a Davenport-born musician more widely known under the name \"Bix.\" As a jazz musician, Beiderbecke became known for the quality of his improvisation in his performances. He joined the Jean Goldkette group in Detroit in the latter half of the 1920s, but, only a handful of years later, died after suffering from lobar pneumonia at the age of 28.\n\nMildred Day\n\nBorn: Durham, a hamlet near Knoxville\n\nLifetime: 1903-1996\n\nWhat she's known for: Helping create Rice Krispies Treats\n\nMildred Day, born Harriet Mildred Ghrist, is an Iowan credited with helping to create Rice Krispies Treats after taking a job in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the Kellogg's cereal company. In that job, she and co-worker Malitta Jensen would develop the recipe for Rice Krispies Treats featured on boxes of the cereal in 1941.\n\nMildred Wirt Benson\n\nBorn: Ladora\n\nLifetime: 1905-2002\n\nWhat she's known for: Penned many of the original Nancy Drew books\n\nMildred Wirt Benson is one of many authors who have taken on the pseudonym \"Carolyn Keene\" to write some of the earliest Nancy Drew mystery novels published since 1930. The University of Iowa graduate penned not only the first teen sleuth adventure \"The Secret of the Old Clock,\" but was also responsible for 22 of the first 25 Nancy Drew books.\n\nJohn Wayne\n\nBorn: Winterset\n\nLifetime: 1907-1979\n\nWhat he's known for: Oscar-winning actor in American Westerns\n\nBorn Marion Michael Morrison, the actor and director we know as John Wayne only took up the name with his first starring role in the 1930 film \"The Big Trail.\" His five-decade film career that spanned parts in Westerns and war films eventually led to Wayne's Oscar for the 1969 film \"True Grit.\" Ten years later, the actor passed away as a result of stomach cancer.\n\nNorman Borlaug\n\nBorn: Cresco\n\nLifetime: 1914-2009\n\nWhat he's famous for: Nobel Peace Prize-winning agronomist\n\nBorlaug was educated at the University of Minnesota, studying to be a forester and eventually returning to study plant pathology and receive his doctorate. He spent a large portion of his professional life working to solve wheat production problems in Mexico. It was 1970 when Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize, recognized for years spent improving food production.\n\nVirginia Christine\n\nBorn: Stanton\n\nLifetime: 1920-1996\n\nWhat she's famous for: Radio and film actress\n\nOriginally named Virginia Kraft, Virginia Christine is perhaps best remembered as Mrs. Olson, a character who appeared in television advertisements for Folgers Coffee.
