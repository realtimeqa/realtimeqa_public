We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"Disney needs to see some change here, but the individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it's time for them to step up and say this, you know, garbage to the extent that that's what comes down the pipe in the future isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.\"\n\n\"There's calls for Kimmel to be fired,\" he added. \"I think you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this.\"\n\nFollowing Carr's comments, Nexstar Media Group Inc. said it would stop airing the show on its 32 ABC affiliates. \"Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division.\n\nShortly after Nexstar announced its decision, ABC, which holds FCC-approved licenses for the local broadcast affiliates it owns, also stated that Kimmel would be pulled from the air.\n\nJimmy Kimmel timeslot replaced with Charlie Kirk special\n\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group announced plans to replace Kimmel's ABC timeslot with a remembrance special honoring Kirk on Friday, Sept. 19. The special will air at all Sinclair stations and be offered to ABC affiliates nationwide, the broadcast company said in a Sept. 17 statement.\n\n\"Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,\" Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement. \"We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities. We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.\"\n\nIt clarified that Sinclair stations will not air \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" until \"we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform.\"\n\nThe company also called for Kimmel to issue a direct apology to Kirk's family and to make a personal donation both to the family and Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA.\n\nDonald Trump reacts to 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' suspension\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who had attended a state dinner earlier Wednesday evening, took to Truth Social at 1 a.m. in the UK, writing, \"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.\" Trump wrote in his social media statement that Kimmel was cancelled, while ABC called it a suspension.\n\nTrump has repeatedly pressured broadcasters to stop airing content he has found objectionable. \"That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,\" Trump added. \"Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.\"\n\nIn July, Stephen Colbert announced that Paramount, CBS' parent company, planned to cancel \"The Late Show.\" It sparked a heated debate in the entertainment industry over whether the decision was a thinly veiled political favor, as Paramount awaited approval for a merger before the Federal Communications Commission. Like Kimmel, Colbert is a frequent critic of the president.\n\nA similar conversation is brewing after ABC, in December, paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump over anchor George Stephanopoulos' on-air description of the president's conduct in the E. Jean Carroll case.\n\nWhat else did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk's death?\n\nIn a Sept. 11 episode of his show, Kimmel criticized Trump for saying Democrats were responsible for the fatal shooting of Kirk. \"With all these terrible things happening, you would think that our president would at least make an attempt to bring us together, but he didn't,\" Kimmel said.\n\nHe then mentioned statements issued by former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton regarding Kirk's death, adding that they tried to bring Americans together after tragedy.\n\n\"President Trump did not. Instead, he blamed Democrats for their rhetoric,\" Kimmel said.\n\nOnline reactions to Charlie Kirk's killing test First Amendment limits\n\nOutside of Hollywood and the entertainment industry, judgment has come quickly for some social media commenters across the country over posts about Kirk in the days after his assassination.\n\nRepublican leaders and conservative commentators have warned Americans to mourn Kirk respectfully or suffer consequences, and some people have been fired or suspended after discussing the killing online.\n\nA Phoenix sportswriter, a University of Mississippi faculty member, school employees in Idaho, Indiana and South Carolina, emergency workers, a theater professor and other university employees in Tennessee, and a Marine Corps recruiter have been among the professionals fired, suspended or put on leave over social media posts some people found offensive.\n\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Clemson University, The Joe Burrow Foundation and the Carolina Panthers were among organizations across the country that took action over social media posts by employees. In Nashville, leadership of a prominent restaurant group said staffers' comments had led to their terminations.\n\nContributing: Pamela Avila, Keith Sharon, Angele Latham, Cate Charron, USA TODAY; David Shepardson and Daniel Trotta, Reuters\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information and video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/17/jimmy-kimmel-fired/86211522007/", "title": "Was Jimmy Kimmel fired?

Here's what we know.\n\nThe full transcript: What did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk?\n\nDid Jimmy Kimmel get canceled?\n\nAs of Wednesday, Sept. 17 − when news broke of the fate of Kimmel's late-night talk show − the host has not been fired and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" has not been canceled. Instead, the talk show \"will be pre-empted indefinitely,\" an ABC spokesperson said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press and CNN, Kimmel's contract with ABC is up in May 2026. The network has aired Kimmel's late-night show since 2003.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Kimmel's representatives for comment.\n\nNexstar Media Group Inc. said on Wednesday, Sept. 17, it would stop airing the show on its 32 ABC affiliates. \"Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, in a statement.\n\nWhat has the FCC chairman said about Jimmy Kimmel?\n\nBrendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, had seemingly threatened ABC, Disney and Kimmel over his monologue about Kirk during a YouTube episode of commentator Benny Johnson's show on Sept. 17. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said.\n\nIn a Fox News interview Wednesday, Carr said it is time for broadcasters and the FCC to fulfill its \"unique obligation\" of operating in the public interest. He criticized late-night shows for \"enforcing a very narrow political ideology\" instead of \"being court jesters that would make fun of everybody in power.\"\n\n\"And Nexstar, as you noted, stood up and said, 'Look, we have the license, and we don't want to run this anymore. We don't think it serves the interests of our community.' Sinclair did the same thing,\" Carr said. \"So, there's more work to go, but I'm very glad to see that America's broadcasters are standing up to serve the interests of their community. We don't just have this progressive foie gras coming out from New York and Hollywood.\"\n\nWhat does 'preempt' mean?\n\nPreempting in the context of television programming is when one show is substituted for another. In this case, it's a euphemism for pulling \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" from the air.\n\nWhy did ABC News also fold to Trump?\n\nABC News settled a Trump lawsuit in 2024. Trump had sued for defamation after anchor George Stephanopoulos said on air that Trump had been found liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll; Trump was found guilty of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. Many legal experts believed ABC News had a good case.\n\nContributing: Reach Goodykoontz, The Arizona Republic", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/17/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-comments/86209731007/", "title": "What did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk?", "text": "Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show has been pulled from the airwaves following comments he made about Charlie Kirk's assassination.\n\nWalt Disney-owned ABC confirmed on Wednesday, Sept. 17, that it will indefinitely suspend \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the head of the Federal Communications Commission condemned comments made by the Emmy-winning comedian.\n\nIn his show's opening monologue on Sept. 15, Kimmel said supporters of President Donald Trump were \"desperately trying to characterize\" Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged in Kirk's murder, as \"anything other than one of them.\" Last week, Kimmel also criticized Trump for saying Democrats were responsible for Kirk's death at a Utah campus on Sept. 10.\n\nHere's what Kimmel said about Kirk on his show on Sept. 15.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

In between the finger-pointing, there was, uh, grieving on Friday − the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this.\n\nYes, he's at the fourth stage of grief: construction. Demolition, construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend; this is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish, OK? And it didn't just happen once. And then we installed the most beautiful chandelier. Responses you wouldn't believe. Who thinks like that, and why are we building a $200 million chandlier in the White House? Is it possible that he's doing it intentionally so he can be bad about that instead of the (Jeffrey) Epstein list? …\"\n\nWatch Jimmy Kimmel's monologue about Donald Trump, Charlie Kirk\n\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 17, the president celebrated Kimmel's show being pulled off-air on TruthSocial, writing, \"Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.

Kimmel has not been officially fired, though it remains unclear if, and when, his show will return to the air.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

The indefinite suspension of Kimmel's show by ABC was announced soon after.\n\nLetterman slammed Carr while speaking at The Atlantic Festival, quipping, \"Who's hiring these goons? Mario Puzo?\"\n\nSeth Meyers says freedom of speech has been threatened\n\nIn a Sept. 18 episode of \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" the \"SNL\" alum echoed sentiments that the First Amendment right to freedom of speech is under threat following Kimmel's suspension. \"This is a big moment in our democracy and we must all stand up for the principles of free expression,\" Meyers said.\n\nDespite a sarcastic bit where he said he has always \"admired and respected\" President Donald Trump, Meyers assured fans that his show will not change its critical tone out of fear of retaliation.\n\n\"May I just say, it is a privilege and an honor to call Jimmy Kimmel my friend in the same way it is an honor to do this show every night.

In its 91-year history the FCC has routinely reserved its moderation of broadcast TV to regulating lewd or profane content. For the long history of late-night TV, from Johnny Carson to Jay Leno to Kimmel and his current fellows, hosts have had free reign to say what they want on any topic, no matter how controversial or political.\n\nExcept maybe not anymore. Earlier this year CBS announced it was canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" after the 2025-2026 TV season, ostensibly because of finances, and Trump and conservatives celebrated. Immediately after ABC's decision to preempt Kimmel, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in delight, further calling on NBC to cancel the remaining two broadcast late night hosts: Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nHow did we get to a place where the president of the United States is potentially influencing who gets to crack what jokes at 11:35 p.m. on weeknights? What does ABC's quick pulling of \"Kimmel\" mean for the future of a genre already desperately imperiled by a changing media world? And what does it mean for the ability of comedians and entertainers to exercise their right to free speech and to speak truth to power?\n\nWhy did ABC really pull 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' off the air?\n\nIn his episode Monday, Sept. 15, Kimmel said the following: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" The man who shot Kirk has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, whose mother has said that, despite being raised in a conservative home, his politics had lurched left in recent years.\n\nBrendan Carr, chairman of the FCC, seemingly threatened ABC, Disney and Kimmel over the comment. \"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said on a YouTube episode of commentator Benny Johnson's show Sept. 17.\n\n\"There's calls for Kimmel to be fired,\" he added. \"I think you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this.\"\n\nAfter Carr's words, Nexstar Media Group Inc. said it would stop airing \"Kimmel\" on its 32 ABC affiliates. Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval from the Trump administration for a merger, just like CBS's parent company, Paramount, was when it announced Colbert's cancelation (it has since received that approval to be bought by Skydance). Nexstar is seeking to buy broadcaster TEGNA in deal worth a reported $6.2 billion, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSo was it about Kimmel's comments offending viewers, or offending the head of the FCC?\n\n\"For the FCC to crack down on speech that does not involve curse words or extremely lewd language and instead requires viewers to make political inferences is certainly unprecedented. We know the president has hated Kimmel and wanted him off the air and now he got his wish,\" entertainment and media law attorney Camron Dowlatshahi said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nOpinions and speech about Kirk's killing have proven particularly volatile across American culture in the past week. Washington Post opinion columnist Karen Attiah claimed she was fired after posting Kirk's own words on social media site Bluesky. MSNBC said it severed ties with its analyst Matthew Dowd after he said on the air that Kirk had pushed hate speech in his public life and \"hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.\" Less high-profile employees of other companies have been fired or placed on leave for their public comments on Kirk. Perhaps it was only a matter of time until someone from Hollywood joined that list.\n\nIs late-night TV officially over?\n\nOnce upon a time Johnny Carson lulled America to sleep with wit and panache every night from the stage of \"The Tonight Show\" on NBC, watched by millions and respected by nearly all.\n\nThose days are decidely over. For years, broadcast late-night TV comedians have seen declining audiences, leaned more toward political humor over cultural takes and struggled to adapt to a modern media landscape where streaming services, YouTube and TikTok compete with traditional TV viewing.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that we are coming to a natural conclusion to a genre of TV that was once appointment viewing. In addition to Colbert's cancelation, CBS recently ended its 12:30 a.m. series \"After Midnight\" when host Taylor Tomlinson decided to leave in favor of her stand-up career. NBC's \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" recently axed its live, in-studio band as a cost-cutting measure. \"The Tonight Show\" went from five nights a week to four in 2024, joining the other late-night shows. Conan O'Brien, who briefly inherited the \"Tonight Show\" throne, has moved from decades of traditional late-night TV on NBC and later TBS to the low-fi world of podcasting. Samantha Bee's TBS talk show was canceled in 2022.\n\nBut there's a difference between natural attrition and the guillotine. Ratings are low but not dire. Costs are high but not insurmountable. YouTube views for Fallon's stunts are down but still in the millions. With the support of their networks, Fallon, Meyers, Kimmel and Colbert could go on as long as the hosts were willing to keep writing jokes. \"The Daily Show\" on Comedy Central, \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" on HBO and \"Gutfeld\" on Fox News (a distinctly conservative show) are still happily chugging along.\n\nBut that requires executives' support, and it's unclear in this moment in cultural history if anyone has the will to stand up to vociferous politicians or antsy shareholders.\n\nFallon, Meyers and Colbert will have all eyes on their Sept. 18 shows, which typically record in the afternoon before their late-night airtimes. Their reaction to Kimmel's suspension will help shape what their fellow comedians and celebrities do next as the second Trump administration continues to impact Hollywood far more than anyone ever anticipated.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-jimmy-fallon-reaction-tonight-show/86231175007/", "title": "Jimmy Fallon reacts to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension", "text": "Jimmy Fallon is rooting for the return of his fellow late-night Jimmy.\n\nOn the Sept. 18 episode of \"The Tonight Show,\" Fallon addressed ABC's controversial move to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\"The big story is that Jimmy Kimmel was suspended by ABC after pressure from the FCC, leaving everyone thinking, 'WTF?'\" Fallon joked at the start of his monologue.\n\nOn a more serious note, Fallon came to Kimmel's defense, telling viewers, \"To be honest with you all, I don't know what’s going on, and no one does.

Jon Stewart even made a surprise return to \"The Daily Show\" to discuss the news, although he typically only hosts the show on Mondays.\n\nIn Stewart's highly sarcastic segment, the comedian acted deferential to President Donald Trump as if he were worried about being canceled next.\n\n\"Our great administration has laid out very clear rules on free speech,\" he said sarcastically. \"Now some naysayers may argue that this administration's speech concerns are merely a cynical ploy.

Kimmel's woes should scare ...", "text": "After a long day at work, millions of Americans plop down on their couches, grab their remotes and pick something they love to watch on TV to relax and entertain them before they do it all again tomorrow.\n\nBut the choices are getting fewer, seemingly thanks to President Donald Trump.\n\nABC announced on Wednesday, Sept. 17, that it was \"indefinitely\" pulling \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" the network's long-running late-night talk show, off the air following comments Kimmel made about the arrested suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk. ABC's decision came after Kimmel's comments were maligned by Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, and after broadcaster Nexstar pulled the show from its affiliates over the remarks.\n\nThe decision has rocked the entertainment industry and captured the attention of a nation divided, as the conversation about Kirk's death becomes more contentious. Trump added more fuel to the fire in a press gaggle on Thursday, Sept. 18, with a suggestion that TV networks that cover him negatively could have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\n“They're 97% against ‒ they give me only bad publicity or press,\" Trump claimed to reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew back to the United States from the United Kingdom. \"I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nNational television networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are not granted licenses by the FCC. Instead, the FCC issues licenses to individual local broadcast affiliates authorizing the stations to use public airwaves.\n\nKimmel is not the first to be reprimanded or potentially lose a job over saying something publicly related to Kirk. But ABC's quickness to pull Kimmel off the air following public pressure from the Trump administration is chilling to anyone who works in comedy and entertainment, and should be equally disturbing for anyone who believes we should get to choose who to watch and listen to from the comfort of our own homes.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr says 'we're not done yet'\n\nThe traditional role of the FCC in regulating network television has been reserved for extreme instances of obscenity, regulating business dealings and enforcing relevant laws. Making specific criticisms and threats over a few seconds on one TV show is beyond unusual. But perhaps not anymore.\n\n“I do think that again, we are in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, again, including the permission structure that President Trump’s election has provided,” FCC chief Carr said in an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box on Thursday Sept. 18.\n\n“And I would simply say we’re not done yet with seeing the consequences of that,” he said.\n\n“The issue that arose here, where lots and lots of people were upset, was not a joke,” Carr added. “It was appearing to directly mislead the American public about a significant factthat probably one of the most significant political events we’ve had in a long time.\" However, it was only after the episode aired that more detailed evidence and information officially was released to the public about the shooter's political ideology and potential motive.\n\nIn his Sept. 15 monologue, Kimmel said, \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"\n\nTyler Robinson, 22, was identified as the suspect on Sept. 12 and there was a flurry of speculation about Robinson's politics because of the conservative part of Utah where he grew up. By Sunday, Sept. 14, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox began hinting that Robinson's politics were different than his family's, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Robinson had a \"leftist ideology.\" The governor said while Robinson was not cooperative, investigators had spoken with his family and his live-in partner, who Cox described as transitioning from male to female.\n\nStill, before Monday, Sept. 15, the day in which Kimmel would have filmed his episode, authorities were not making definitive statements about Robinson's political ideology.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 16, a court filing was released that included comments from Robinson's mother who said that, despite being raised in a conservative home, her son's politics had pivoted to the left in recent years. The filing also included text messages from Robinson and his roommate that further illuminated the case.\n\nCorporations will have to be the ones to stand up to free speech threats\n\nJimmy Kimmel has had a show on ABC since 2003. He's not just the host of one show; ABC and its parent company Disney have invested in the comedian as one of the faces of the brand, down to Kimmel literally representing them at presentations to advertisers and selling their content.\n\nHe has hosted the Oscars on ABC four times − only Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal and Bob Hope have had that gig for more go-rounds. He is also the host of ABC's \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" and has created \"Live in Front of a Studio Audience\" for the network, a series of specials recreating classic episodes of television from shows such as \"The Jeffersons\" and \"All in the Family.\" \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" also promoted numerous network shows over the years.\n\nBut apparently none of that mattered as much as threats from the FCC, the ire of affiliate owner Nexstar (itself seeking regulatory approval from the Trump administration for a merger) and the general toxic conversation about Kirk.\n\nABC's decision could be, in part, about money, but the finances are complicated. A fine from the FCC could be costly, but officially firing Kimmel could be costly, too. The comedian has a contract through 2026, according to reports, which may not be easily broken. Even if ABC can offload Kimmel without financial penalties, the cancellation could cost them advertising dollars. \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" is in second place in its time slot among viewers overall, and first place among ages 18 to 49, a key demographic that advertisers care about.\n\nTrump wants the late night guys off the air, and now two of them are gone. Who will be left on TV when he's done?\n\nIn the same interview with CNBC, Carr said he wasn't trying to get all the late night comedians off the air. But his threats were quick and had an immediate response. Will Hollywood writers live in fear of their own cancellations if they upset those in power? Can the other late night comedians say what they think and believe now? Can \"Law & Order: SVU\" rip any cases from the headlines? Can \"South Park\" continue to criticize and satirize Trump? Can \"SNL,\" which returns Oct. 4, do a cold open that even mentions Kirk?\n\nKimmel's unceremonious suspension comes days after Hollywood celebrated the best and brightest in TV at the 2025 Emmy Awards. Stephen Colbert, a prominent Trump critic with his own recently canceled show, received a standing ovation when he presented an award and later returned to the stage to accept an Emmy. Stars wore pins supporting a ceasefire in Gaza on the red carpet. Best supporting actress in a comedy winner Hannah Einbinder said \"(Expletive) ICE\" and \"Free Palestine\" in her acceptance speech.\n\nComedians, actors, filmmakers and musicians have long exercised their rights to free speech and the benefits of their large platforms to speak out for causes they believe in and to promote one political agenda or another. While there has long been a stereotype that Hollywood is all liberal, plenty of conservative celebrities also routinely make their political opinions known. But one group may be a bit more hesitant than the other after this uproar.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-show-suspended-reactions/86210908007/", "title": "David Letterman, Kamala Harris react to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension", "text": "The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show is sparking widespread outrage among his high-profile friends and supporters, while some of the comedian's critics, including the president, are celebrating ABC's shock move.\n\nA spokesperson for the network confirmed to USA TODAY on Sept. 17 that \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will be \"pre-empted indefinitely.\" The decision came after Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, put pressure on ABC to take action against Kimmel over a comment he made about Charlie Kirk's alleged killer.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n\"This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, said during a YouTube episode of commentator Benny Johnson's show on Sept. 17.\n\n\"Disney needs to see some change here, but the individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it's time for them to step up and say this, you know, garbage to the extent that that's what comes down the pipe in the future isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities,\" he continued. \"There's calls for Kimmel to be fired. I think you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this.\"\n\nFollowing Carr's comments, Nexstar Media Group Inc. said it would stop airing the show on its 32 ABC affiliates. Shortly after Nexstar announced its decision, ABC, which holds FCC-approved licenses for the local broadcast affiliates it owns, also stated that Kimmel would be pulled from the air.\n\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group, which also owns a basket of ABC affiliates, announced plans to replace Kimmel's timeslot with a remembrance special honoring Kirk on Friday, Sept. 19.\n\nAs of Thursday, Sept. 18, it was not clear how ironclad the \"indefinitely\" in ABC's statement announcing Kimmel's cancellation was. A staple in late-night programming, the show serves as a one-stop shop for daily comedy monologues and celebrity interviews, particularly for stars promoting shows on ABC and its parent company Disney. Over time, the hole left by Kimmel's absence in the daily line-up will certainly be felt by cable viewers.\n\nWhile neither Nexstar nor ABC offered the public a clear set of guidelines for how they would proceed, Sinclair did leave the door ajar, saying in a statement: \"We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.\"\n\nIt clarified that Sinclair stations will not air \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" until \"we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform.\" The company also called for Kimmel to issue a direct apology to Kirk's family and to make a personal donation both to the family and Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA.\n\nWhether Kimmel will bend to such a request remains to be seen. His contempt for President Trump, who applauded ABC's decision, is well documented, and the show's fiery political takes could face an uncertain future with a could-be cancellation hovering never far in the background.\n\nDeadline reported that Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Dana Walden called the comedian directly to tell him the news, and that Disney CEO Bob Iger was involved in the decision; the outlet also cited sources saying that Kimmel was unwilling to apologize for his on-air comments.\n\nFor now, the stand-off remains.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/18"}]}

Yet he hasn’t always had a warm reception there, clashing with residents over his resort plans and facing protests over his politics.\n\nWhile more protests are in the works, Trump should get a friendly greeting from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the two meet to talk trade ahead of a formal state visit to the United Kingdom in September.\n\nThe Scottish trip is a prelude to that pomp-filled state visit, where Trump will meet with British royalty. Here’s what to know about the trip.\n\nRefining trade deal\n\nThe United Kingdom was the first country to reach a trade agreement with the Trump administration after the president paused his reciprocal tariffs in April.\n\nTrump is ramping up his tariff push again, and more countries are agreeing to trade pacts ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline for new levies to take effect. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president and Starmer will work to “refine” their trade agreement during the Scotland trip. The UK is America’s ninth largest trading partner.\n\nTrump’s UK trade deal kept a 10% universal tariff on the country while lowering tariffs on automobiles and steel. The UK pledged to open its markets for U.S. agricultural products such as beef and ethanol.\n\nProtests planned\n\nWhile Trump meets with Starmer, protesters will gather around Scotland to blast the president.\n\nThe UK-based Stop Trump Coalition is organizing demonstrations in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dumfries, according to its website. The group organized large protests when Trump visited the UK during his first administration and relaunched after his re-election.\n\nStop Trump Coalition said it is working to “To defeat the politics of Trumpism, and to promote an alternative, democratic vision of the world based on peace, social justice and international cooperation.”\n\nWindsor Castle up next\n\nTrump will be back in the United Kingdom from Sept. 17-19 for a more elaborate visit that includes meeting with King Charles III at Windsor Castle.\n\nTrump is an admirer of the British royalty. He met Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, twice during his first term as president, visiting Windsor Castle in 2018 and dining with the queen at Buckingham Palace during a 2019 state visit. Trump's September trip will be his second state visit to Britain, a first for a U.S. president.\n\n“He is honored and looking forward to meeting with his majesty the king,” Leavitt said, calling the trip \"truly unprecedented.\"\n\nTrump met with King Charles’ heir to the throne, Prince William, in December in France during the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\nTrump has called the U.S. relationship with the UK “the highest level of special.” Scotland, in particular, has personal significance for the president.\n\nTrump’s Scottish resorts and controversy\n\nScotland is closely associated with the game of golf and its history, and Trump is an avid golfer with an extensive portfolio of golf properties.\n\nThe president is visiting his Scottish golf resorts, Trump Turnberry on the west coast and Trump International Scotland in Aberdeen on the east coast.\n\nThe Aberdeen property has been a headache for Trump for years. He faced opposition to his development plans for the property and waged an unsuccessful legal battle to block a wind turbine farm off the coast.\n\nBut the president can now celebrate the development of a second golf course at Trump International Scotland. The second course will open on Aug. 13, according to the resort’s website.\n\nTrump has pushed to have the Turnberry property host the Open Championship, one of the four major golf tournaments, but organizers say it presents logistical issues. A pro-Palestinian group recently vandalized the property that has previously been the site of four British Open events.\n\nBeyond his resorts, Trump is connected to Scotland through family lineage.

House Republicans proposed a stopgap funding bill to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, but Democrats are pushing policy demands such as extending healthcare subsidies that are set to expire.\n\nThen there’s the Epstein controversy, which has followed Trump to England on his brief trip. As the president met with the royal family and Starmer, protesters gathered in parts of England to highlight his past friendship with Epstein.

It was illegally used. He never gave the orders. He never told them what to do, and I guess the only one he signed or one of the few he signed was the pardon for his son,” said Trump, referring to the Dec.1 pardon of Hunter Biden, who had pleaded guilty to tax violations and was convicted on firearms-related charges.\n\nPresidential use of the autopen has not been outlawed or ruled unconstitutional.

Some information came to light last week that wasn’t available when he was appointed, and I made a decision about that.\n\n“Very clear,” Starmer said, as he pivoted to Russia.\n\nA lewd birthday note that allegedly bears Trump’s signature, and he denies writing, was part of the records U.S. lawmakers obtained from Epstein’s estate. - Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says Kimmel should have been fired ‘a long time ago’\n\nPresident Trump said Kimmel was fired over his “lack of talent,” pushing back at concerns about the state of free speech in the United States after ABC canceled the comedian’s late-night television show following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings, more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,” Trump said in his first public comments about Kimmel’s show being indefinitely postponed.\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago,\" the president continued, adding: “You can call that free speech or not. He was fired for lack of talent.” - Joey Garrison\n\nWhat 7 wars has Trump ended?\n\nPresident Trump during the news conference again made the claim to have ended seven wars while in office.\n\nSince January, the United States has been involved in five ceasefires or peace agreements, USA TODAY has reported. Those conflicts include: Armenia and Azerbaijan; the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda; Iran and Israel; India and Pakistan, and Cambodia and Thailand.\n\nTrump also appears to be referring to two conflicts dating to his first term. Though Serbia and Kosovo agreed to economic normalization, no peace deal has been signed. There's also Ethiopia and Egypt, which are not at war but have unresolved tense relations. - Zach Schermele\n\nWhen will President Trump and Melania come home?\n\nThe president and first lady are set to depart from London around 5 p.m. local time on Sept. 18.

And you know, the best investors and very rich people and companies are going to be owning it,” Trump said. “Very legitimate companies.”\n\nTrump earlier this week said he reached a preliminary TikTok deal.\n\nU.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok poses a national security threat, believing ByteDance, TikTok's parent company based in Beijing, is sharing U.S. user data with China. TikTok has repeatedly denied these claims. - Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says Russia’s war on Ukraine ‘doesn’t affect’ the U.S.\n\nUnless the fighting in Ukraine spreads beyond the eastern European country’s borders, President Trump says he does not believe Russia’s assault on the sovereign nation affects the United States.\n\n“It doesn’t affect the United States…other than unless you end up in a world war over this thing, you could,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said earlier in the news conference that Russian President Vladimir Putin had let him down and again claimed Putin wouldn’t have launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office. – Francesca Chambers\n\nWho is British Prime Minister Keir Starmer?\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, 63, was a lawyer before he became leader of the now-governing Labour Party in 2020. He is known for being temperamentally methodical, for his professionalism and for his grasp of policy detail. British media often describe him as a tad boring and colorless because he has a flat, nasal vocal delivery.\n\nStarmer was awarded a knighthood in 2014 for his work as a human rights prosecutor, so he's technically a \"Sir\" - Sir Keir Starmer. In that role, he worked on high-profile cases in Britain, including that of Stephen Lawrence, a Black teenager who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in London in 1993 while he was waiting for a bus.\n\nStarmer was born Britain's capital and often says he had a typically average upbringing in a lower-middle-class family. His father made tools and his mother was a nurse who developed a rare autoimmune condition when her son was 11 that led to her limbs being amputated.\n\nStarmer is married and has two teenage children. He studied law, first at the University of Leeds, then the University of Oxford. He's a fan of Arsenal, a Premier League soccer team. - Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nTrump warns UK illegal migration ‘destroys countries from within’\n\nTrump, standing alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the joint news conference, advised the United Kingdom to adopt his administration’s efforts to combat illegal immigration, warning that it “destroys countries from within.”\n\nTrump recounted a conversation he had with Starmer on the matter.\n\n“I think your situation is very similar,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter. “You have people coming. I told the prime minister, 'I would stop it.' And it doesn’t matter if you call out the military. It doesn’t matter what means you use, but it’s going to destroy. It destroys countries from within.” - Joey Garrison\n\nMelania Trump’s sartorial choices send fashionista tongues wagging\n\nFor her lavish banquet at Windsor Castle during her second U.K. state visit, first lady Melania Trump wore a bright yellow floor-length off-shoulder dress with a lilac belt designed by Carolina Herrera.\n\nTo some she looked resplendent, to others she recalled a banana. Some deemed it perfect, others thought it was too casual. Melania Trump paired the dress with long emerald earrings.\n\nOn Sept.18, as she toured the Royal Library at Windsor Castle with Queen Camilla, the first lady wore a caramel brown leather skirt suit by Louis Vuitton.\n\nFor her outing with Princess Catherine for a tour of Frogmore Gardens, the first lady wore a brown leather belted jacket by Ralph Lauren with cream ankle-length pants and ballet flats. - Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump on Gaza: 'I want the hostages released now. Right now.'\n\nAmid reports that the UK will soon recognize a Palestinian state, Trump once again urged Hamas to release their hostages in Gaza.\n\n\"Right now,\" Trump said. \"I want an end.\"\n\nHe said he had a \"disagreement\" with the Starmer on Palestinian autonomy – \"one of our few disagreements.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer sought to downplay the disagreement, saying the two long-time allies “absolutely agree on the need for peace and a roadmap” in Gaza because the situation is “intolerable” and humanitarian aid must be allowed in.- Zach Schermele and Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump on Putin: ‘He’s really let me down’\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he believed that Russia’s war on Ukraine would be the easiest global conflict for him to resolve because of his past relationship with Vladimir Putin.\n\n“But he’s let me down. He’s really let me down,” Trump said of the Russian leader, who he met with last month in Alaska.\n\nTrump said he’s still settle that war and the “complex” conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“It’s going to get done, and it will all get done right. And likewise, Russia and Ukraine, will get done,” Trump said. – Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump: Charlie Kirk could have been president one day\n\nTrump brought up the assassination last week of Charlie Kirk in his opening remarks at the joint press conference, saying the 31-year-old conservative activist was killed “for speaking his mind.”\n\n“He was a great young man,” Trump said. “Incredible future. Some people said he might be president someday. I told him, I said, ‘Charlie, I think you have a shot someday of being president.'”\n\nTrump thanked British citizens who have offered their condolences on Kirk’s death. Trump is set to attend Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona on Sunday. - Joey Garrison\n\n‘Long journey together’: Starmer says UK to celebrate the USA's 250th birthday\n\nStarmer singled out next year’s 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States, when in 1776 the U.S. declared its independence from Great Britain.\n\n“Mr. President, next year, we’ll celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States. We’ve come on a long journey together,” the prime minister said.\n\nHe touted the “partnership our two nations have built” over the past 250 years. “Time and time again, it is British and American men and women, side by side, changing the path of history,” Starmer added.\n\nTrump has planned a yearlong celebration in 2026 marking the country’s 250th anniversary. - Joey Garrison\n\nBritish PM hails ‘special relationship for a new era’ with US\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer kicked off the joint news conference with Trump, hailing a “special relationship for a new era” between the United States and Great Britain.\n\nStarmer touted a new U.S-British agreement on investments in science and technology that Trump and Starmer signed earlier in the day.\n\n“With the groundbreaking agreement that we’ve just signed this afternoon, we’re confirming our status as the first partners in science and technology, ready to define this century together,” Starmer said. - Joey Garrison\n\nTrump and Starmer get down to business\n\nThe first day of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK ended with a banquet and a toast to America's prosperity. Now, the two countries are getting down to business.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting Trump at his Chequers country estate for a private discussion, before they play up commercial investments from Fortune 500 companies at a business reception and take questions from the media at a joint news conference.\n\nU.S. officials declined to say ahead of the meeting what Trump and Starmer would discuss but the leaders have exchanged views on the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine during previous talks. Starmer is helping to organize a coalition of nations to defend Ukraine against future Russian attacks while Trump takes the lead on peace negotiations.\n\nThe allied countries are at odds, however, over Israel's ongoing war against Hamas. Starmer has said the UK will join France and other nations in recognizing a Palestinian state at a United Nations gathering next week, if Israel does agree to a ceasefire and improve humanitarian conditions. The United States has sharply criticized the underlying resolution and said it is hurting diplomatic efforts to end the war.\n\nSo far, Trump's visit has been heavy on pagentry and light on policy, with a trade deal between the two countries already agreed upon. The two leaders were expected to sign agreements involving technology and nuclear partnerships.\n\nThe British government said the countries had agreed to a package of $341 billion in commercial investments that would lead to a combined 7,600 high-quality jobs markets. - Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat is Chequers?\n\nPresident Donald Trump is meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, a 1,500-acre, 16th-century manor house and estate about 30 miles northwest of London. Chequers is the official country retreat of British prime ministers - the Camp David of Britain if you like.\n\nAnd like its American counterpart, Chequers has hosted many historic and famous meetings. During World War II, Winston Churchill conducted war-related business long into the night at Chequers, often punctuated by a movie or large dinner. Churchill was also at Chequers when he heard Japan's navy had attacked the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into the war.\n\nMore recently, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Chequers. And in 2018, former Prime Minister Theresa May was at Chequers when she finalized her plan for Brexit - Britain's exit from the European Union, though it was her successor, Boris Johnson, who got the plan approved by Britain's Parliament.\n\nStarmer will give Trump a tour of Churchill's archive at Chequers, which is where he wrote and broadcast many of his wartime speeches. Historians say Churchhill composed many of them while propped up in bed or pacing the estate's garden. - Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump tours Royal Library and Frogmore Gardens\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump began the second day of the U.K. visit with a tour of the Royal Library in Windsor with Queen Camilla.The library included a display table of miniature books made especially for the Queen Mary doll house. It included books such as “How Watson Learned the Trick” by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and “Winnie the Pooh” by A.A. Milne, both published in 1922.\n\nThe pair then met with six schoolchildren who were writing and drawing pictures of animals.\n\n“You need to have very small writing to fit on a very small book,” the first lady told one child.After that, the first lady joined Princess Catherine for a tour of Frogmore Gardens and a visit with a Scouts division of “Squirrels” for children ages 4 to 6.The children sat at two activity tables putting ink on leaves and pressing them on paper.As she interacted with the children there, one child asked the first lady what her favorite bug was, she replied, “A ladybug.” - Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nA lavish banquet and an overnight stay a Windsor Castle\n\nTrump's accommodations were fit for a king: the president and first lady Melania Trump were overnight guests of King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe British royals held a lavish banquet for the Trumps attended by high-profile executives, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump said he and King Charles shook “about 150 hands\" before the dinner. The president called his unprecedented, second state visit \"one of the highest honors of my life.\"\n\nOffering a toast to the Trumps, King Charles said it was a celebration of an \"unparalleled partnership\" between the two nations and wished \"health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States of America.” - Francesca Chambers\n\nCEOs snag invites to Trump reception\n\nCEOs from some of the nation's top businesses are flocking to the United Kingdom for a roundtable and reception Starmer is putting on for Trump on the final day of his state visit.\n\nThe CEOs expected to attend ranged from tech leaders to money managers and includes Apple's Tim Cook, NVIDIA's Jensen Huang, Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Citigroup's Jane Fraser, BlackRock's Larry Fink, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Lockheed Martin's Jim Taiclet, Nucor Steel's Leon Topalian, Salesforce's Marc Benioff and Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, according to a list obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nMore than two dozen business leaders were expected to attend the reception at Chequers, according to a British government official familiar with the invitations.\n\nTrump's visit to the UK formally kicked off on Sept. 17 with a horse-drawn carriage ride to Windsor Castle and an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla. - Francesca Chambers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/27/trump-king-charles-state-visit-starmer/80718679007/", "title": "Trump snags invite from King Charles for 2nd UK state visit", "text": "Jeff Mason, Michael Holden and Sachin Ravikumar\n\nReuters\n\nWASHINGTON − Donald Trump accepted an invitation from King Charles on Thursday to visit Britain, making him the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer handed Trump a letter from Charles during a press conference with reporters at the White House. Trump immediately accepted the invitation.\n\n\"This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented,\" Starmer told Trump as he handed him the letter.\n\n\"The answer is yes,\" Trump responded, telling Starmer that he would attend with first lady Melania Trump. \"We look forward to being there and honoring the king, honoring the country.\"\n\nNo date for the visit was announced.\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth welcomed Trump for a three-day state visit in June 2019 during his first term in office, during which he had attended an opulent state banquet and a private lunch with the sovereign, as well as having tea with Charles, who was then heir.\n\nThat visit already put Trump in a select group of U.S. presidents, as only Barack Obama and George W. Bush were afforded official state visits to Britain during Elizabeth's record 70 years on the throne.\n\nIt would also turn out to be the last of the more than 110 she hosted during her reign before her death in September 2022.\n\nThe visit was not the only occasion when Trump met Elizabeth.

Trump's first U.K. state visit came in 2019 during his first term.\n\nHere's what to know about Trump's trip.\n\nLaying wreath at Queen Elizabeth's tomb\n\nAfter arriving on Tuesday night, Trump and first lady Melania Trump will visit Windsor Castle on Wednesday, Sept. 17 and meet with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, according to a preview of the carefully choregraphed visit from the White House.\n\nKing Charles III and Queen Camilla are set to formally welcome the first couple, though Camilla's status is unclear after she pulled out from attending a Sept. 16 funeral service for the Duchess of Kent as she recovers from acute sinusitis.\n\nThe Trumps plan to have lunch with the king and queen in the castle's state dining room. Afterward, the first couple will visit St. George's Chapel to privately lay a wreath at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022 at 96 years old. Trump met the queen during his previous state visit.\n\nLater, the Trumps are set to join the king, queen and Starmer, as well as United States and British military families, for a ceremony on the castle's east lawn. It will be followed by a state banquet at the castle.\n\nProtests are set to follow Trump during his visit. The Stop Trump Coalition said it has organized a protest outside Windsor Parish Church, where organizers will hold signs saying Trump is not welcome.\n\nTrump to hold bilateral meeting, news conference with British PM\n\nTrump and Starmer are set to hold a bilateral meeting on Thursday, Sept. 18 followed by a business reception, where both men will deliver remarks and hold a joint news conference.\n\nTrump and Starmer have built a close relationship during their second term, overcoming their stark political differences. Starmer is a self-proclaimed socialist, while Trump has pushed the Republican Party further to the right. They met just last month when Trump visited Scotland to visit the two golf properties he owns there.\n\nMeanwhile, the first lady and queen will tour Queen Mary's Dolls' House and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. The first lady will later join the Princess of Wales at Frogmore House and Gardens to meet Dwayne Fields, the chief scout in the UK's Scouts Association.\n\nThe trip is intended to highlight the historic relationship between the United States and the U.K., according to a White House official, while also celebrating the upcoming 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States upon its declaration of independence from Great Britain.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller are among the top White House officials joining Trump on the trip.\n\nTouting tech, nuclear power investments\n\nWhile the visit will be heavy on the pageantry, Trump will also carry out some policy aims, according to senior Trump administration officials who briefed reporters on the agenda on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump and Starmer are set to tout a new science and technology partnership between their two countries which includes more than $10 billion in new investments. Several tech CEOs from the United States will be on hand to participate in meetings, the officials said.\n\nIn addition, the two countries are expected to announce cooperation and agreements on nuclear energy, an area that Trump has made a stated priority.\n\nThis includes plans for partnerships between U.S. and U.K. companies to deploy nuclear reactors in the U.K. and a memorandum of understanding between the two nations that seeks to \"streamline\" the regulatory process to build nuclear plants. The U.K. has a goal of achieving full independence from Russian nuclear fuel by 2028.\n\nTrump officials and their British counterparts are also set to announce efforts to advance defense technology.\n\nUkraine, steel tariffs and Mandelson\n\nTrump's visit comes after the United Kingdom in May became the first country to reach a trade agreement with the new Republican administration. The deal included a baseline 10% U.S. tariff on British imports, as well as lowering 25% tariffs on auto imports to 10%.\n\nU.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the U.K. remain at 25%, however. Starmer is looking to use his meeting with Trump to finalize an agreement to lower tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nAlso not officially on the agenda ‒ but certain to be discussed by Trump and Starmer ‒ is Russia's war with Ukraine.\n\nTrump's meeting in August with Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to lead to progress toward a peace deal as he hoped. In a display of unity for Ukraine, Starmer joined a coalition of leaders from European allies at the White House on Aug. 18 while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Trump.\n\nTrump's trip has also collided with the controversy involving Peter Mandelson, who was fired as British ambassador to the United States last week after newly reported emails and other documents showed his onetime support for the late, disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump, who was also a longtime friend of Epstein, has faced his own Epstein controversy over the Justice Department's refusal to release all documents related to the government's investigation of Epstein.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to the king and queen, Trump is scheduled to return to the United States on Air Force One on the night of Thursday, Sept. 18.\n\nThree days later, the president on Sept. 21 will depart for Arizona to attend a memorial service for the late Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and Trump ally who was killed by an assassin last week.

His election was a landslide for the Labour Party, ejecting the Conservatives from power after five consecutive Conservative prime ministers held Downing Street.\n\nThe UK has been a leading supporter of Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion, and it is one of the leading donors of military assistance to Ukraine, alongside the U.S. and Germany, according to a recent briefing from the House of Commons Library. The UK has pledged more than $16 billion in aid since the war began, as of the June 2025 report, of which $10 billion is for military aid.\n\nIn a statement released ahead of the Aug. 18 summit, Starmer reaffirmed the UK's support of Ukraine, threatening increased sanctions on Russia in response to the ongoing war. \"Our unwavering support for Ukraine will continue as long as it takes,\" he said.\n\nWho is Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni?\n\nGiorgia Meloni has been Italy's prime minister since October 2022. She is Italy's first female prime minister and the country's first far-right leader since World War II.\n\nItaly is one of six founding members of the EU and it's the bloc’s third-largest economy. In the past, Italy has played a valuable role as a bridge between Europe and antagonistic governments in Russia and China, and in some Middle Eastern nations. As with most of EU member states, and similiar to the five other leaders joining her in Washington, DC, Aug. 18, Italy has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine throughout the war.\n\nIn a joint statement following Trump's meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, Aug. 15, Meloni joined several other EU leaders in a pledge to support Ukraine, saying the nation must have \"ironclad\" security guarantees to defend its territorial integrity in any peace negotiations.\n\n\"Our support to Ukraine will continue. We are determined to do more to keep Ukraine strong in order to achieve an end to the fighting and a just and lasting peace,\" the Aug.. 16 statement said.\n\nWho is French President Emmanuel Macron?\n\nFrance's president Emmanuel Macron has led the country since May 2017, and cruised into a second term in 2022 against Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist who attacked the European Union and NATO, and expressed support for Russia.\n\nIn the early days of the war, Macron fashioned himself as one of Europe's key mediators in the burgeoning conflict, and attempted to establish dialogues with Putin to end the war, though they proved unsuccessful. As of late, Macron has taken a leading role in Europe's push to keep Trump from legitimizing Putin and rewarding the Russian invasion with a hurried deal to end the Ukraine war.\n\nMacron was the first European leader to visit the White House since Trump's return to office earlier this year.\n\nWho is German Chancellor Friedrich Merz?\n\nAmong the four European heads of state who have descended on the White House for the talks, Friedrich Merz is the newest to office, after winning election in May 2025. He is the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party, and heads Europe's largest state economy.\n\nGermany's decision to send military aid to Ukraine in 2022 marked a significant reversal in the country's long-standing position of never sending offensive weapons to conflict zones. Among European nations, it is among the top providers of aid to Ukraine. According to a May 2025 report from the German government, this aid includes equipment and weapons such as air defense systems, combat vehicles, artillery systems, armored transport vehicles, small arms, and ammunition, as well as other types of support, including medical supplies and clothing. Between the start of the year and May 2025, the report says total German aid to Ukraine exceeds $50 billion.\n\nWho is Finnish President Alexander Stubb?\n\nAlexander Stubb is the president of Finland, making him the only leader at the White House meeting representing a nation that borders Russia. He was elected in February 2024, roughly a year after the country joined NATO. A member of the conservative National Coalition Party party, he previously served as the prime minister, finance minister, foreign minister, trade, and Europe minister of Finland.\n\nFinland has committed more than $4 billion in aid to Ukraine since the war began, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWho is European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen?\n\nUrsula von der Leyen has been president of the European Commission since 2019, and is the first woman to hold the post. She was a lawmaker in Germany prior to taking the position, serving in Germany's legislature and as Federal Minister of Defence, among other roles. In her capacity as president, she manages the organization of the European Commission, including on matters of policy, and often represents the body in international meetings and summits.\n\nIt's the second meeting von der Leyen has had with the U.S. president in as many months, following a July 27 meeting at one of Trump's luxury golf courses in Scotland, where they reached a U.S.-EU trade deal.\n\n\"Since the beginning of Russia's brutal invasion, Europe has been at Ukraine's side, united, and we will support you for as long as it takes for a just and lasting peace,\" she said in an Aug. 16 statement following a meeting with Ukraine's president. \"And this peace must be achieved through strength.\"\n\nWho is NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte?\n\nMark Rutte is NATO's secretary-general. He took office in October 2024 and was formerly Prime Minister of the Netherlands from October 2010 to July 2024.\n\nNATO is an intergovernmental military alliance with two North American countries – the U.S. and Canada – and 28 European countries. Founded in 1949 after the end of World War II, NATO is the “largest peacetime military alliance in the world,” according to the U.S. Department of State. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but a NATO partner country, which means that it cooperates closely with NATO but it is not covered by the security guarantee in the Alliance’s founding treaty. The prospect of joining NATO is a major sticking point in potential peace talks, with Ukraine wanting the security alliance and Russia strongly opposing it, with Putin long considering NATO's existence and its continued growth as a threat.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY; Reuters.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

The U.K., the U.S.' ninth-largest trading partner, originally faced a 10% universal baseline tariff on exports to the U.S., but the deal lowered the rate on automobiles and steel.\n\nBut the president is also expected to visit his golf courses in Scotland: Trump Turnberry and Trump International Scotland. The Trump International Scotland resort is poised to open a second golf course next month. The resort includes buildings bearing the name of Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who emigrated from Scotland to New York in the 1930s.\n\nThe National Scottish paper goes viral for front page\n\nAs Trump heads overseas, people in Scotland are planning to protest. U.K.-based group Stop Trump Coalition has a few demonstrations planned, as they did when Trump visited in his first term.\n\nOne local paper, The National, ran a front page story on July 25 that was a pointed announcement of Trump's arrival.\n\n\"Convicted US Felon to Arrive in Scotland,\" the headline reads, with Trump's scouring eyes from his new presidential portrait peering over the words.\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in May 2024, a historic development for a former president who would win the election months later. In the hush money case where Trump was found guilty, he received an \"unconditional discharge\" sentence, meaning he received no prison time or probation.\n\nThough calling someone a \"felon\" is considered outdated language, Trump's felony conviction has not yet been erased through appeal or expungement.\n\nTrump's Epstein woes follow him abroad, WSJ banned from trip\n\nTrump's trip to Scotland comes as controversy over the Epstein files continues to roil the administration. People in the U.K. aren't letting him forget it either. A social media video posted by Everyone Hates Elon, a group \"pissing off billionaires one small action at a time,\" showed a sign placed under the Trump International Golf Links sign.\n\n\"Twinned with Epstein island,\" the sign read, according to the video.\n\nOn July 17, the Wall Street Journal reported on a birthday letter from Trump to Epstein, prompting Trump to sue the newspaper and the reporters, as he called the story \"false, malicious, and defamatory.\" NBC News and POLITICO reported that the White House later removed the Journal from the group of outlets that is traveling with Trump to Scotland.\n\nBut that didn't stop the Journal from later reporting, along with CNN, that Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump in May that he was mentioned in the criminal case files. Bondi's Justice Department on July 7 released a memo saying no further disclosure of the documents was needed after teasing a \"truckload\" of Epstein files in March. (Being named in the files does not indicate wrongdoing.)\n\nAs Trump heads over the pond, a senior Justice Department official and Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, are meeting for a second day.\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

I won the shirt for making the finals of an ice-cream eating contest outside Ben & Jerry’s original store in Burlington, Vt., in 1978, the company's first year in business.\n\nI was a college student there at the time, and one of the shop’s first best customers. Ben & Jerry’s, of course, went on to become a world-famous brand, known as much for its clever marketing and a socially conscious corporate identity as its ice cream.\n\nBut in the fall of 1978, the renovated gas station had only been open for a few months. The contest was part of their marketing efforts during Fall Down, Burlington's downtown fall festival.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

As it became a bigger and bigger success, I’d occasionally mention I had been around at their start. Sometimes I'd hear from someone who visited the Burlington store that they had seen my picture from that first fall event on the wall. The photo also wound up in an A&E \"Biography\" documentary about the company.\n\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield became more enduring heroes of my youth than the Clash or Elvis Costello or other people and events of previously discarded T-shirts. They made a lot of money but always furthered other causes, like supporting the Vermont economy, empowering their employees — and having fun.\n\nBut still. It was 2017. I hadn’t worn the shirt in decades. I saw that many other Ben & Jerry’s shirts — none as rare as mine — were for sale on eBay. So I thought it was time.\n\nA couple days later, I overheard a colleague mention that Jerry from Ben & Jerry’s was coming to Milwaukee Friday to judge ice cream made by students in the Milwaukee Public Schools new culinary arts program.\n\nI went to cover the event, and brought my shirt. Jerry hugged me (he hugs everyone), and we briefly reminisced about that first Fall Down carnival and the ice-cream eating contest. (I didn’t win.

Jerry.”\n\nThe experience reminded me of a story I’d written a few years ago about the first Super Bowl shirt. A man who still had one his mother had gotten him as a child refused a $1,000 offer for it from the designer’s grandson but was ultimately persuaded to donate it to the Packers Hall of Fame.\n\nMaybe my original Ben & Jerry’s T-shirt (with the early “Lick it” tagline on the back) could wind up back in Vermont in a case some day.

The company opened a production facility in Oak Park this spring during the shutdown, allowing it to package products for wholesale. Gabriel said the shutdown caused growth in wholesale to halt, but since then the company has brought its products to several dozen grocery stores' shelves. Browndog ice cream is available at shops such as Cantoro's Italian Market in Northville Township, Jonna's Market in Westland and Woodward Corner Market in Royal Oak.\n\nWith an increase in carryout business across the restaurant industry, Gabriel said they've sold plenty of ice cream for customers to take home.\n\n\"Curbside and delivery our pint sales are going crazy,\" he said. \"Everything was pints and it was a good thing we had that facility.\"\n\nGabriel said Farmington was a great place to operate the business and was sad to leave.

And not only did Jerry say yes, he brought four unannounced flavors for me to sample.\n\nWe met at a small cantina in midtown Manhattan, where Jerry greeted me with a hug. Within minutes, the top-secret flavors — officially revealed this morning — appeared in front of me: Hazed & Confused, That's My Jam, Peanut Butter Fudge and Salted Caramel.\n\nThe flavors introduce a new \"Core\" line for the company, which means each contains a rich core of salty caramel, raspberry jam or what have you right down the middle.

No, not Norway’s second largest city. The county in northern New Jersey.\n\nHäagen-Dazs built its reputation on a ruse. The company developed a nonsensical name meant to sound Danish and printed a map of Scandinavia on its pint lids to conjure up an air of old-world tradition and craftsmanship.\n\nThe misdirection worked magic.\n\nFirst sold in 1960 out of delis on Manhattan's East Side, Häagen-Dazs didn’t advertise. It didn’t need to. Embraced by the hipsters and social influencers of the day, Häagen-Dazs pints were distributed nationwide by the early 1970s.\n\n“We found an alternative market, one steeped in the marijuana culture of the sixties,” company co-founder Rose Mattus wrote in her memoir. “Our early clients were a motley assortment of oddballs with long hair, fringe tastes, and decidedly eccentric business styles.”\n\nIn 1976, Häagen-Dazs parlayed its success in supermarket freezers into scoop shops like those operating today in Edgewater, Fair Lawn and Ridgewood.\n\nThose high-end establishments are a far cry from the days when Häagen-Dazs creator Reuben Mattus sold ices out of a pushcart in the Bronx. An Eastern European immigrant, Mattus was 19 when he took over his mother Lea’s frozen dessert business in 1932. His revamp, named Senator Frozen Products, launched Ciro's ice cream in the early 1950s. The brand at first performed well but was pushed off shelves by large manufacturers, such as Borden and Sealtest.\n\nAmerican Dream: American Dream reveals how much it will cost you to park at the entertainment complex\n\nMattus was left looking for a way back. As he sat at his kitchen table in 1959, he conceived his niche product: a high-butterfat, all-natural blend. It used the best ingredients he could find and relied solely on egg yolks to emulsify and stabilize the iced cream. Rose Mattus wrote in her memoir that its trademark thickness was the fortunate result of a broken air injector at the processing plant.\n\nThough it was born in the Bronx, Häagen-Dazs grew up in Bergen County. The company opened its Teaneck headquarters in 1984, a year after the Mattuses sold their company to distribution powerhouse Pillsbury and netted $70 million. The couple, who called Cresskill home, stayed on as consultants to guide the brand until 1990. During its 11 years in Teaneck, Häagen-Dazs significantly expanded its product line. It launched ice cream bars, frozen yogurt and sorbet among new ice cream blends and flavors.\n\nThe Mattuses had another idea. In 1992, the couple that made bank on butterfat started a decidedly off-brand ice cream company: Mattus Ice Cream Co in Fairfield. It made ice cream with only 3 percent fat – compared to 14 or more in premium ice creams. Reuben Mattus credited a heart attack for his change of heart.\n\nFollowing the split with the Mattuses, Häagen-Dazs started to break ties with New Jersey. The company headquarters relocated to Minneapolis, the home of Pillsbury, in 1995. By 1998, the ice cream factory 30 miles south of Teaneck, in Woodbridge, was shuttered. Nearly 280 workers were left jobless.\n\nToday, the Häagen-Dazs brand is owned by General Mills. General Mills produces the ice cream sold in Europe in a factory built by the Mattuses in 1992 — not in Scandanavia, but in France. However, in the states, the product is licensed to Nestlé and produced by that company’s Dreyer's brand.\n\nThe brand still uses a ruse in its sales. Häagen-Dazs “pints” have been two ounces short of 16 since the company downsized its cartons by one-eighth in 2009.\n\nEmail: Zimmer@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/business-food/choco-taco-return", "title": "The Choco Taco is not quite dead yet | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA few weeks ago, Klondike appalled the internet when it said that the Choco Taco would be discontinued.

After that, the company’s ice cream will no longer be sold in the Palestinian territories, but will continue to be sold in Israel “through a different arrangement.”\n\nThursday’s lawsuit, filed in New Jersey, said that Ben & Jerry’s owner Unilever (UL)’s demands to sell ice cream only in certain parts of Israel is illegal under Israeli law.\n\n“Ben & Jerry’s and Unilever’s actions are misguided, unlawful and immoral. Boycotting Israel should come with a heavy price tag, and therefore, we are taking Unilever to court,” AQP owner Avi Zinger said in a release. “There is still time to do the right thing. Renew my license and leave ice cream out of the political debate.”\n\nBen & Jerry’s told CNN Business would not comment on the lawsuit. Unilever didn’t immediately respond to comment to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Vermont-based ice cream company, which has been doing business in Israel since 1987, has come under scrutiny for its relationships in Israel in recent years as tensions in the region have flared. Critics have taken the company to task for doing business in Israel — especially in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law — arguing it doesn’t align with Ben & Jerry’s liberal image.\n\nThe company had been mostly silent on the topic. In 2015, Ben & Jerry’s posted on its website that it was “keenly aware of how complex the local market can be,” and it believed it could affect positive change by maintaining a presence in the region.\n\nBut the company had a change of heart in July 2021, saying it heard and recognized the concerns shared by its fans and partners, opting to get out of making ice cream in Israel and selling in the Palestinian territories altogether.\n\nThe decision sparked backlash in the country, including from Prime Minister Naftali Bennett who said that Ben & Jerry’s has decided to brand itself as the “anti-Israel ice cream.”", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/companies/buzz/2017/04/30/buzz-summer-business-preview/101032714/", "title": "The Buzz: Summer business preview", "text": "Maureen Wallenfang\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nIs it warm yet?

The first test was conducted in October 2021.\n\nIn this test, a sounding rocket was fired from the launchpad, carrying out different experiments to gather data and collect information on components of hypersonic missiles, including heat-resistant materials and high-end electronics.\n\n“The launch today went extremely well,” said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, the director of Strategic Systems Programs who oversaw the test. “As a matter of fact, we’ve just gotten done looking through our key observables, and every piece of data that we wanted to collect - at least preliminarily - has shown that we collected all that data.”\n\nA second rocket is scheduled for launch on Thursday and will carry out an additional 13 experiments designed to inform hypersonic weapons development, the Navy said.\n\nThe data collected from these tests will help in the development of the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic system and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. The two programs will both use the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, a projectile carried atop a booster rocket that coasts towards its target at speeds greater than Mach 5.\n\nHypersonic weapons travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or approximately 4,000 miles per hour, making them difficult to detect and intercept in time.

The money announced Thursday is coming from a 10 cent-a-gallon increase in the state gas tax that lawmakers passed this year at the urging of Gov. Kay Ivey. Twenty-eight projects were selected in all for a total of $30.1 million in funding from the state. The largest amounts of $2 million each are going to the cities of Saraland, Springville and Houston County. Some local governments are providing about $9.5 million total to assist with the work. A statement from Ivey’s office said every citizen will see benefits from infrastructure spending. The law passed earlier this year requires at least $30 million annually for local governments under the tax hike.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported Wednesday that Alaska Airlines mileage plan members will not be able to earn miles on American Airlines international flights beginning March 1. Officials said Alaska Airlines passengers will also no longer be able to use miles for award travel on American flights. The airlines said Alaska plan holders will still be able to earn mile-for-mile value on American flights with Alaska flight numbers to locations in the Midwest, the East Coast and parts of Canada. Before the announcement, American Airlines was Alaska’s final domestic mileage plan partner, meaning Alaska plan members will not have another major carrier on which to use miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:There have been 16 deaths in Arizona this year attributed to the West Nile virus, nearly half of the 35 deaths reported nationwide. Arizona has had not only more deaths but more total cases of West Nile infection than any other state in the nation this year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maricopa County is driving the high case numbers and deaths. All but one of the 16 deaths statewide were in Maricopa County. In 2018, the state health department recorded six deaths from the West Nile virus. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. Infected mosquitoes then spread the West Nile virus to people and other animals by biting them, the CDC said. Investigators are looking at the local ecology, bird and mosquito populations, rainfall and disease patterns, among other factors. The total case count of West Nile virus in Maricopa County is 153 this year, which is a 750% jump over the same time last year, county data showed. Other mosquito-borne diseases were also up in Maricopa County this year. St. Louis Encephalitis, Dengue and Chikungunya infections have all increased over last year's case count, county data says.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Officials in this economically struggling city are redirecting tax money meant for a revitalization plan to bolster city budgets. Residents passed a sales tax in 2017 that was projected to generate almost $32 million in seven years. The City Council voted Monday to divert $2.1 million of its projected $4.5 million in extra annual revenue, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. It includes allocating $300,000 each to the Police Department, youth and community resources, the convention center, in addition to $200,000 to the Fire Department. Another $1 million will be allotted to drainage needs. Nonprofit organization Go Forward Pine Bluff, established in 2015 and governed by an independent committee, is working with the city government to improve the town and economy. Unless Mayor Shirley Washington vetoes the resolution, the group could lose around $10.5 million in subsidies.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Hotels in the nation’s most populous state will have to stop giving guests small plastic shampoo bottles under a new law set to take effect starting in 2023. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday he signed a law banning hotels from giving guests plastic bottles filled with shampoo, conditioner or soap. It takes effect in 2023 for hotels with more than 50 rooms and 2024 for hotels with less than 50 rooms. Violators could be fined $500 for a first offense and $2,000 for subsequent violations. The law follows similar actions by some of the world’s largest hotel chains. Marriott International has said it plans to stop using small plastic bottles in its hotel rooms by December 2020. IHG, which owns Holiday Inn, Kimpton and other brands, said it will eliminate about 200 million small bottles by 2021. Last year, Walt Disney Co. said it would get rid of small plastic shampoo bottles at its resorts and cruise ships. The law comes as California officials are trying to reduce the amount of plastic waste. The state already bans grocery stores from giving customers single-use plastic bags without charging a fee. Last year, former Gov. Jerry Brown passed a law allowing restaurants to hand out plastic straws only upon request. The Personal Care Products Council opposed the legislation, arguing it would hurt personal care product manufacturers.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A group opposed to hydraulic fracturing announced a lawsuit seeking to halt new oil and gas drilling permits until updated regulations are in place. Colorado Rising attorney Joe Salazar said the Denver District Court complaint alleges the state is issuing drilling permits under rules made obsolete by a new law. The law requires the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to put public health and safety ahead of production in considering permits. It’s devising rules to comply. A group of Broomfield residents contends, in part, that the agency didn’t afford them the right to raise health and environmental objections afforded them under the new law as the agency considered a well location permit. Commission spokeswoman Megan Castle noted that the agency repeatedly has advised the public that it will conduct business, including considering permit applications, under the new law while it devises new rules.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: Students at Killingly High School have chosen a replacement for their Native American-themed athletic mascot. Superintendent Steve Rioux told The Norwich Bulletin that about 80% of students who voted selected Red Hawks to replace Redmen. The other finalist was Razorbacks. The new nickname is subject to approval by the town’s Board of Education. The change is the culmination of a yearslong process that began with citizen complaints to the board about the offensive nature of the former mascot. The board decided to make a change during the summer, when the Nipmuc Tribe, based in the area, stated their opposition to it. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation also condemned the mascot as “racist and stereotypical.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials on Thursday recovered the body of a 6-year-old boy who went missing when an SUV carrying five young people plunged into the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on Sunday morning. There was only one survivor in the accident, a 16-year-old girl. The bodies of three boys – two brothers and their cousin – were recovered shortly after, but officials had been searching for the body of 6-year-old Ethan Lindsey since then. He was found at about 8:45 a.m. Thursday, police said. State police said they received a 911 call from someone who saw the body in the water near the north bank of the canal, about a quarter-mile from the west end of the William V. Roth Jr. Bridge. Ethan's father, Willis Lindsey Sr., posted an update on Facebook, saying the boy had been located. Willis Lindsey said he and his family were traveling from Wilmington to Easton, Maryland, in separate cars for a youth football game when both vehicles took a wrong exit and ended up on a gravel road along the C&D Canal. It is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and used to access the waterway and bridges to perform maintenance and repairs. Lindsey was driving with his wife; 10-year-old son, Donald; and 2-year-old daughter to Donald's football game. In the other car, his eldest son, Willis Jr., 18, was driving a 16-year-old female friend; his brothers Kyree, 16, and Ethan, 6, and their 12-year-old cousin, Eric Lindsey. The elder Lindsey, 40, said he and his son turned their vehicles around and were headed back to the main road when he lost sight of his son's car after rounding a slight bend. Lindsey Jr. helped the female passenger get safely to shore, and jumped back in to try and rescue the three boys. Authorities found Lindsey Jr.'s body in the water near the site of the crash. They found the bodies of Kryee and Eric just before 5 p.m. Sunday, when the vehicle was removed from the water.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Council has voted to temporarily change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day. WTOP-FM reported the council on Tuesday passed the “Indigenous Peoples’ Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019.” Supporting Councilman David Grosso told lawmakers that the federal holiday honors Christopher Columbus despite him having “enslaved, colonized, mutilated and massacred thousands of indigenous peoples.” He called the legislation overdue, saying D.C. struggles with respecting indigenous people and referencing the Washington Redskins. The legislation requires Mayor Muriel Bowser’s signature to go into effect. It also requires congressional approval to become permanent. Without it, the holiday will revert to Columbus Day next year. Councilman Jack Evans, who’s under federal investigation, abstained from the vote, saying he supports Indigenous Peoples’ Day, “but not replacing Columbus Day.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm City: Authorities said they arrested a man who provoked a small alligator into biting his arm and poured beer into the animal’s mouth. News outlets reported 27-year-old Timothy Kepke and 22-year-old Noah Osborne were charged last week with unlawfully taking an alligator. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers began investigating in August following a complaint of Osborne catching the alligator in Palm City and handing to Kepke. Kepke appears in a video to let the reptile bite his forearm. The video also shows Kepke feeding the alligator beer as it struggles. When officers interviewed Kepke last month, he reportedly acknowledged that he was in the video and said the gator was alive when they released it. The men were released on bond. Jail records didn’t list attorneys for them.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDuluth: Most of the mall heavily featured in the latest season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” is going up for sale. News outlets reported Moonbeam Capital Partners is ready to sell its portion of the long-struggling Gwinnett Place Mall, which has been so empty that a body went unnoticed near the food court for about two weeks in 2017. A senior vice president for real estate firm Colliers International Atlanta, Tony D’Ambrosio, said no asking price has been set for the mall’s interior retail portion and much of its parking lots. The mall’s anchor tenants and their surrounding parking spaces, including Macy’s and a now-shuttered Sears store, are owned separately.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hawaii will consider whether to restrict access to a nature reserve where rock-climbing activities are threatening native plant species, officials said. The state Board of Land and Natural Resources is expected to consider restricting portions of the West Maui Natural Area Reserve, The Maui News reported Wednesday. The state Division of Forestry and Wildlife asked the board to limit access to cliff areas in the Lihau section of the reserve for up to two years. The board is expected to consider the request during its meeting on Friday in Honolulu. Rock climbers have installed hardware and footholds in cliffs in the area, officials said. Modifying geological features including chipping rock for footholds is prohibited under state law, according to land and natural resources board documents. The changes affect threatened and endangered plants such as the Maui chaff flower and the Menzies’ schiedea. Climbers hiking to the rock walls also are affecting West Maui’s only known population of yellow hibiscus, which is in danger of trampling or breakage, officials said. The dry cliff ecosystem is home to vegetation that grows on steep slopes in areas receiving less than 75 inches of rainfall per year, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The forestry and wildlife division proposed installing signs explaining to rock climbers why the activity threatens the rare plants.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An early deep freeze has potato and onion farmers rushing to harvest crops or hoping the buried vegetables will survive the frozen nights this week. Travis Blacker with the Idaho Potato Commission said an estimated 15% to 20% of Idaho’s potato crop remained in the ground Wednesday. The Idaho Department of Agriculture said onion growers are in similar straits and working overtime to finish the harvest. Other crops at risk include sweet corn and dry beans. Blacker said harvesting during freezing temperatures can hurt the quality of the potatoes, and rushing can lead to accidents. National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Wojcik said a low-pressure system from Canada is causing the high winds, low temperatures and snow. He said Boise’s temperatures were about 20 degrees below average on Wednesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A preservation group is struggling to find a developer to save a historical coal-fired power plant the owner said is deteriorating and presents safety concerns. Preservation Chicago is making its last attempt to prevent the demolition of Union Station Power House, which sits along the Illinois River in the South Loop. The power plant was built in the 1930s to supply the massive amount of energy needed to run Union Station and its surrounding infrastructure. The Amtrak-owned plant closed in 2011 when that power was no longer needed. Ward Miller, who heads the preservation group, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the power house is an example of the city’s industrial roots and a monument to its history as a transporter of people and freight. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said that although the company hasn’t made its final decision on what to do with the building, the structure is deteriorating rather quickly and has safety issues. He noted that Amtrak has made significant progress in planning for the demolition, but because preservationists have expressed an interest in reusing the structure, the company is open to preservation proposals, though there have been none.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrawfordsville: Wabash College, which has handed out sheepskin diplomas to its graduating seniors for 187 years, is going to end the practice. College administrators said the quality of the diplomas has deteriorated while the prices have soared.Year 188 will bring paper. Wabash College President Gregory Hess told the Indianapolis Star last week in a written statement that the availability of sheepskin diplomas and timely delivery have been an issue for years. The diplomas cost the college $28,000 to $32,000, depending on the size of the graduating class, which ranges from 175 to 200 graduates. The diplomas would cost about $160 each. James Amidon, the college’s Director of Strategic Communications, said the college will look for museum-quality, archival grade paper, but it's not yet clear how much that will cost.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: City officials gathered with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leaders and members of Iowa’s congressional delegation for a groundbreaking ceremony of a new flood gate to protect part of downtown from Cedar River flooding. The 4-foot-thick gate will be 14 feet tall and 67 feet long and will hide behind a flood wall when not in use, the Gazette reported. It can be rolled into place within about 30 minutes to protect the New Bohemia business district when the river rises. A contract to complete the $2.4 million gate was signed last week, and construction will likely begin later this year or next spring, said Jason Smith, a program manager with the Corps. The city has been slowly assembling a $550 million flood control system since devastating floods ravaged Cedar Rapids in 2008. Last year, the Corps announced the approval of $117 million federal funding for flood protection in Cedar Rapids. Of that, $41 million must be repaid by the city. City officials have estimated the full east side system would cost $245 million.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new water plant planned for Wichita is behind schedule, delaying a City Council decision on keeping a nearly $524 million contract that has prompted an investigation of the mayor. The Wichita Eagle reported the contract gave Wichita Water Partners until Oct. 4 to submit a cost estimate for a part of the plant it is designing. The council had planned to decide at the end of October whether the group could start construction. But on Oct. 3, City Manager Robert Layton approved the group’s request for a 75-day extension. The Dec. 18 deadline is after the Nov. 5 mayoral election. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett opened an investigation after The Eagle reported that Mayor Jeff Longwell steered the contract to the group and it includes friends of his.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s Court of Appeals has appointed its first female clerk. Rebecca Combs Lyon assumed the post Oct. 1. She has worked with the court for more than 30 years and has become the first woman in the role since Kentucky’s modern court system was created more than 40 years ago. The court said in a news release that Lyon has worked as an appellate staff attorney, civil motions panel attorney, deputy chief staff attorney and chief staff attorney. As clerk, she’s now responsible for custody, control and storage of all appellate records. Lyon succeeds Samuel P. Givens Jr., who retired last month after 30 years with the court system.\n\nLouisiana\n\nOpelousas:A large cross has disappeared from the wreckage of an African American church in Louisiana that was burned down in an arson case. News outlets reported the white fiberglass cross belonged to Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas. It was one of three historic churches set ablaze in arson attacks earlier this year. The Rev. Gerald Toussaint told The Acadiana Advocate he noticed the cross was missing Friday after a meeting with architect Stephen Juan Ortego. Ortego said the congregation wanted to use the cross as a relic of the destroyed church. On Facebook , Ortego asked anyone with information to message him. Toussaint said he’s hesitant to file a report because it might be a “fruitless effort.” Holden Matthews was indicted in June on federal arson and hate crimes charges.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The world’s largest 3D printer and the largest object ever printed have been unveiled at the University of Maine. The university showed off a 25-foot, 5,000-pound boat Thursday that researchers think is just the beginning of the type of product that companies can bring to the market faster with 3D printing. The boat was printed at the university’s Advanced Structures & Composite Center. The school and Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee are collaborating on the project, which aims to help businesses innovate with larger, faster prototypes. The university said Guinness World Records confirmed it’s the world’s largest 3D-printed boat, the largest 3D-printed object and largest prototype polymer 3D printer.\n\nMaryland\n\nSecretary: A wastewater treatment plant on Maryland’s Eastern Shore has received a $5.8 million federal grant for an upgrade. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris made the announcement Wednesday. The Twin Cities wastewater treatment plant is shared by the towns of Secretary and East New Market in Dorchester County. The grant will be accompanied by a loan of about $1.1 million. The money will be used to upgrade the wastewater treatment plant for enhanced nutrient removal. The U.S. Agriculture Department said it will correct a health and sanitary problem at the existing treatment plant, due to its deteriorating condition.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The Telegram & Gazette reported that the Worcester Planning Board voted Wednesday to give definitive site approval to the Polar Park project and associated private development. The Worcester Redevelopment Authority is overseeing construction of a minor-league ballpark and municipal parking garage, and Madison WG Holdings LLC is doing the private development. The ballpark will be home to the Boston Red Sox’s Triple-A affiliate, currently located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. To meet deadlines to get the ballpark open by 2021, the city will be approving development in phases and will approve details such as landscaping, lighting and architectural elements at a later date.\n\nMichigan\n\nSpring Lake: The remains of a Michigan soldier who went missing during the Korean War’s fierce Battle of Chosin Reservoir are being returned home after DNA testing confirmed that he died in that battle nearly 70 years ago. U.S. Army Sgt. David Alexander Feriend was 23 in December 1950 when he was listed as missing in action, after the 17-day siege near the Chosin Reservoir in eastern North Korea. Feriend’s remains were among 54 boxes of human remains that North Korea turned over to the U.S. after a June 2018 summit in Singapore between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced in August that Feriend had been “accounted for.” DNA testing verified that the remains in box number 36 were those of Feriend, WOOD-TV reported. Feriend’s sister, Irene Arbogast, said her parents had hoped for years that he was a prisoner of war. Feriend will receive full military honors when his remains arrive at Gerald R. Ford International Airport near Grand Rapids late Friday. Patriot Riders and the Michigan State Police are expected to accompany his remains to a Traverse City-area funeral home.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Enbridge Energy has offered the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa at least $24 million to settle a lawsuit the tribe filed to shut down and remove the Line 5 pipeline from its reservation. But, tribal leaders said their position against the pipeline remains unchanged. Line 5 carries up to 540,000 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario. Minnesota Public Radio News reported Enbridge is offering $12 million to settle claims over expired easements on tribal land, as well as $10 million that would follow the start of a new Line 5 route outside the reservation. Enbridge, based in Calgary, Alberta, would also pay the tribe $2 million annually until the pipeline’s operation is no longer in use on the reservation.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Hunters who use dogs to pursue deer could see reduced access to national forests in Mississippi. A report for the U.S. Forest Service found few large continuous tracts of national forest land in Mississippi judged suitable for hunting with dogs. Adjoining landowners often complain when dogs enter their property. Forest Service spokesman Mario Rossilli told the Clarion Ledger that officials will meet with interested groups to discuss possible changes. But David Smith, president of the Mississippi Dog Hunting Association, said if the Forest Service would open closed forest roads, allowing hunters to catch dogs before they leave public lands. He said roads are opened for hunters in Alabama and Georgia. Smith also questions the validity of the report because University of Georgia researchers didn’t come to Mississippi before issuing it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Officials are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, “Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that’s absurd” and “This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.” The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet’s mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper. The city said it picks up nearly 25 pounds of poop a week from downtown parks and parking lots, with the work costing $7,500 annually.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: More than 488,000 people visited Glacier National Park in September, a 12.5% increase over the same month last year. The Flathead Beacon reported that the National Park Service said 2.9 million people have come to the park this year, a 3.5% jump over 2018. The strong September numbers come on the heels of a busy August, when more than 771,000 people visited Glacier. Just two months ago, year-to-date visitation was down more than 3%, with 1.6 million people coming to the park between January and July. One likely reason for the spike in August and September visitation is that for the first time in three years, the park did not have a major wildfire.\n\nNebraska\n\nChadron: A winter storm system has dropped nearly a half-foot of snow in northwest Nebraska, making roads and highways treacherous. The National Weather Service said 5 inches had been dumped on Chadron, where schools and Chadron State College canceled classes for Thursday. The service said 3.4 inches accumulated in Scottsbluff, and more is expected. Schools in Gordon, Hay Springs and Hemingford planned to delay the start of Thursday classes. The eastbound system has brought an inch so far to Valentine. The weather service said blowing and drifting snow are making travel hazardous and said the low temperatures could pose a danger to people working outdoors and livestock. Gusts could approach 35 mph.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Backup plans are being considered for an avalanche control system in Nevada near a year-round highway pass amid concerns about reliability, transportation officials said. The remote-operated Gazex system uses propane-powered blasts to trigger controlled avalanches on state Route 431, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported Monday. The system has been in place near Mount Rose since 1992 and the building that houses the propane and oxygen tanks is about 12 years old. The building receives annual inspections. The next is scheduled for this month. The human-triggered avalanches clear the snow load from slopes overhanging the highway, making the roadway safer for drivers once the debris is cleared, officials said. The Gazex system covers the zone at the summit of the mountain at the highest risk for sliding. Alternatives could include contracting companies licensed and trained to use hand-thrown explosives to trigger controlled avalanches, a common method at ski resorts, said Meg Ragonese, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Transportation. The department has also announced plans to add as many as six new snowblowers for use on the highway in the coming two years, she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Kimberly Piper-Stoddard, an English teacher who instructs inmates in the state prison system, has been named the New Hampshire Teacher of the Year. Piper-Stoddard was honored Wednesday at a ceremony at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord. She’s a teacher at Granite State High School, which is located within the walls of the men’s and women’s prisons. Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said Piper-Stoddard teaches students who have gone down the wrong path but are working to turn their lives around. One student said Piper-Stoddard is excited and enthusiastic about what she teaches, and that’s created “an overwhelming positive change in me.” Other finalists were Jeremy Brown, Littleton High School; Sarah Grossi, Con-Val Regional High School; John “Drew” Groves, Bow High School; Barbara Milliken, Oyster River High School; and Christine Stilwell, Robert J. Lister Academy.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFredon Township: A lost hiker and his dog are safe after a state trooper was lowered by rope down a cliff to reach the man who was holding on to a tree. The rescue happened Monday night in the dark and rain after the hiker called 911 to say he was trapped on an incline along a trail in Fredon Township. Troopers Russell Cahn and Sean Sullivan located the man and the dog. The troopers were worried about hypothermia. Body camera video shows Cahn and firefighters lowered Sullivan by rope to reach the man. The hiker’s dog was hoisted to safety before the man was raised by the rope and was treated at the scene by EMS. The rescue took nearly two hours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials said 18 small fires discovered burning near each other in the Carson National Forest last week were caused by people. The Albuquerque Journal reported U.S. Forest Service is still investigating the exact cause of the fires, which collectively are being called the Maton Fire. A soaking rain on Friday helped firefighting crews contain the blazes, keeping them more than 80% contained by the weekend. Carson National Forest spokeswoman Denise Ottaviano said investigators found 18 points of ignition, and it will take time to determine the cause for each one. She said it was unusual for that many fires to start at one time.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The observatory atop the Empire State Building has a dizzying new look with floor-to-ceiling, 360-degree windows 102 floors above New York City. The remodeled observatory opens to the public on Saturday. It was unveiled to the media on Thursday. More than 4 million annual visitors will get a bird’s-eye view of the city and nearby states. The $58 cost to get to the observatory at 1,250 feet above Fifth Avenue has not changed. The building also has remodeled its famous open-air observatory on the 86th floor. The highest new perch also contains fresh exhibits on the way up. It was a four-year project costing $165 million.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLewisville: Officials said an overheated and smoldering Chromebook caused about 600 children to be evacuated from Lewisville Elementary School, whose district is now recalling about $4.2 million-worth of district-issued laptops. Winston-Salem Forsyth County Schools’ chief technology officer Kevin Sherrill told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that the children were evacuated that morning after the 2015 laptop began to smoke. District spokesman Brent Campbell said a third-grader reported the laptop was getting hot, and it then started to smoke. He said the classroom and building were evacuated, and the laptop was sprayed with a fire extinguisher. Sherrill said the laptop likely suffered a battery-related issue. The district is now recalling all 20,000 of its 2015 Chromebooks, which Sherrill said are each valued at about $210.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: Police are investigating several reports of laser pointers targeting aircraft at the local airport, which is a dangerous crime. KFGO reported authorities said the latest incident happened Sunday night and involved a medical helicopter. There have been similar reports in recent weeks involving aircraft arriving at the Devils Lake airport. When a laser is pointed at an aircraft and enters the cockpit, it has the potential to blind the pilots often at a crucial time – when they’re landing. Interfering with a flight is a federal crime. Police said anyone providing information that leads to an arrest might qualify for a reward through Devils Lake Crimestoppers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Great Ohio River Swim has been canceled because of a harmful algal bloom that could endanger swimmers’ health. Organizers canceled the event Tuesday after it was postponed from late September to Oct. 13. The race is scheduled to return in 2020. The event website thanked participants for their patience through the rescheduling and cancellation and said they can request a refund by email. Greater Cincinnati Water Works said the ongoing bloom of blue-green algae does not endanger residents’ drink water. The city’s health department said anyone swimming, boating or fishing could potentially be at risk of exposure. Health officials have warned that people encountering the harmful algae can have an array of reactions including irradiated skin and eyes as well as cause stomach cramps, headache and difficulty breathing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An ornate conference-room table where the late oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens made billion-dollar deals and hosted VIPs in his Dallas office is heading to the Oklahoma Capitol. Officials at Oklahoma State University announced Wednesday that the 24-foot-long table and 22 leather chairs will be loaned to the governor’s office for the next 10 years. A university donor purchased the four-pedestal desk, inlaid with golden cherry and walnut wood, and donated it to the university. Oklahoma’s new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt is a graduate of Oklahoma State and had inquired about the desk after visiting with Pickens, who died last month at age 91. The governor’s office is being renovated as part of a $245 million project to overhaul the state Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: The Oregon Coast Aquarium has announced a fundraising campaign for an $18 million expansion effort. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Wednesday that the aquarium plans to remodel existing facilities and add a marine rehabilitation center and an outdoor play area. Aquarium officials said the project would be the first major remodeling since the facility opened to the public in 1992. The attraction, located 133 miles southwest of Portland, draws more than 420,000 visitors annually and has hosted 15 million people overall. Aquarium CEO Carrie Lewis said the original facility was not designed to accommodate current visitor numbers. The renovation plan includes a rehabilitation facility for endangered marine animals such as sea turtles, seals and snowy plovers. Officials said those animals are now cared for in a repurposed warehouse.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Trump administration officials said the Navy will name a ship that has yet to be built after the city of Harrisburg. The naming of the future USS Harrisburg was announced Thursday in the Capitol Rotunda at an event that included federal, state and local officials. The $800 million amphibious landing platform dock will be built in Mississippi and is expected to be ready for service in about two years. Officials said the 684-foot USS Harrisburg will be used for amphibious and special operations efforts, as well as humanitarian missions. A previous USS Harrisburg served as a troop transport during World War I.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s largest school district is now giving every student access to free breakfasts and lunches without having to apply for a free or reduced-priced lunch program. The Providence Journal reported that the Providence School Board gave the new policy first passage at its meeting Wednesday night. Board President Nina Pande said removing the application process for reduced-price lunches helps eliminate the stigma for students who are eligible. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 60% of Providence students meet the criteria. Providence Public Schools spokeswoman Emily Martineau said the city is expected to receive about $16 million in reimbursement from the federal government for the program. The school board will take the new policy up for second and final passage at its next meeting.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Much of one of the state’s largest counties was left without water after a 70-year-old pipe broke, sending a torrent of water over a main highway and closing schools, businesses and county offices. A 20-inch iron pipe that carries water from Rock Hill’s treatment plant into the water system in York County, just south of Charlotte, broke Wednesday afternoon because of old age, Deputy City Manager Jimmy Bagley said. The pipe was fixed about 1 a.m. Thursday and water was again running through the system, but officials said it would take hours to restore pressure. About 30 million gallons – enough to fill more than 45 Olympic-size swimming pools – of treated water spilled, Bagley said. About 125,000 customers, including residents, schools and businesses, were left without water and forced to close. Many remained closed Thursday. The torrent of water also shut down U.S. Highway 21. York County residents will need to boil their water until at least Friday afternoon to give state health officials time to test it for safety, Rock Hill Mayor John Gettys said Thursday. City crews were opening fire hydrants to flush out mud and sediment that entered the system through the break and Gettys later asked residents to wait for that process to finish Thursday before washing clothes or taking showers. York is South Carolina’s seventh-most populous county, with 260,000 people, and one of the state’s fastest-growing areas.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Sioux Falls School District on Tuesday held its largest full-scale active shooter training session since 2014. The district had been planning for the training since January 2018, a month before a shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school left 17 dead. School District Risk Manager Bob Bray coordinated the training, and assistant superintendent Jamie Nold walked emergency responders and district officials through various exercises at a simulated command center set up at the district's Instructional Planning Center. No one portrayed the role of the shooter in the exercise. However, 10 student names were listed as “injured” during the training. None of those students participated in the event, district spokesperson Carly Uthe said. Bray said the purpose of the execise was to spot potential pitfalls, future concerns and any security gaps that need to be addressed and adjusted.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:The copyright owners of the “Charlie Brown Christmas” theme song have sued Dollywood in federal court for copyright infringement. News outlets reported the complaint said the East Tennessee theme park named for country star Dolly Parton has used the song without permission in live Christmas performances since 2007. The lawsuit said Los Angeles-based Lee Mendelson Film Productions owns the copyright and is asking for $150,000 for every time the song has been used. According to the suit, “Christmas Time is Here” was written by Lee Mendelson and Vince Guaraldi for the 1965 television special “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” Dollywood said it is aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Officials in this border city have lifted a boil-water notice 1½ weeks after low chlorine levels in the municipal drinking water supply prompted its issuance. In a statement issued Wednesday, Laredo officials said the city’s tap water was safe and could be used for any purpose. An investigation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is underway to determine what caused the variable chlorine levels that had fallen to insufficient levels in some parts of the city of about 260,000 residents. The boil-water notice issued Sept. 28 had applied to all consumption, including for cooking, personal washing and brushing teeth.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Cans of beer have littered the parking lot of a church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after a semi-trailer crashed that was carrying cases of brew banned by the faith. Sandy Police Stg. Jason Nielsen said the semi-trailer veered and fell from a road and into the church’s parking lot after it was hit by a pickup truck that ran a red light on Thursday. Beer cans were strewn across the empty church parking lot. One of the faith’s key rules is a ban on members drinking alcohol. Nielsen said the semi-trailer driver suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The pickup truck driver wasn’t injured. Authorities haven’t determined if he will be cited. The church building wasn’t damaged.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department is warning motorists to be on the lookout for moose crossing roadways this time of year. Officials said it’s breeding season for moose, so they are on the move and more likely to cross roads, particularly after dark or early in the morning. State Game Warden Major George Scribner said drivers hit 57 moose on Vermont highways last year and 36 so far this year. Among the highways that moose frequent are Route 105 from Island Pond to Bloomfield; Route 114 from East Burke to Canaan; Interstate 89 from Bolton to Montpelier; and Route 12 from Worcester to Elmore. Officials said 19 people have died in vehicle collisions with moose on Vermont highways since 1985.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health officials have issued an advisory because of elevated mercury levels found in blue catfish caught in the Nottoway River. The Virginia Department of Health said Thursday that recent fish tissue sample results from the river show mercury levels in blue catfish exceed the amount considered safe for long-term human consumption. The department advises people to eat no more than two meals a month of blue catfish taken from the river. Fish consumption advisories alert people to contaminants present in affected fish species but do not prohibit people from eating fish. Pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children should not eat fish from this advisory area to avoid ingesting mercury.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The cold weather that struck eastern Washington this week is causing worries for apple growers. The cold front is expected to last through the weekend, and calls for lows in the 20s in the Spokane region. The Spokesman-Review said cold temperatures in October could hurt what is projected to be the second-largest apple harvest in state history. Jim DeVaney, president of the Washington Tree Fruit Association, said the harvest is about half complete. He said the crop could withstand some loss from cold weather and still be very large. The potential for damage depends on factor like an orchard’s location and elevation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The mayor of West Virginia’s capital city reversed a decision to change the name of the annual holiday parade after intense backlash from church leaders and conservatives. Mayor Amy Goodwin announced on Monday that she planned to rename the “Charleston Christmas Parade” the “Charleston Winter Parade” to demonstrate that Charleston is an inclusive city. Officials from several churches quickly criticized the decision and said they wouldn’t attend. State Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, issued a statement saying the renaming was the handiwork of “Charleston’s elite liberals.” Under pressure, Goodwin publicly withdrew the name change on Thursday. In a Facebook post, she said “the kind of vitriol that has come forth” over the secular parade title has been “disappointing and hurtful.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has passed a resolution supporting new F-35 fighter jets in Madison despite concerns about noise. Defense officials are considering stationing two F-35 squadrons at Truax Field. The planes would replace the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s aging F-16s. But Truax neighbors are worried about noise from the jets. An environmental impact statement said the noise would render more than 1,000 homes incompatible for residential use. The state Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution supporting F-35s at Truax on an 87-9 vote. The Senate passed it on Tuesday. The resolution’s main authors, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Rep. Tony Kurtz, argued that placing F-35s at Truax will ensure the base remains open and noise concerns are exaggerated.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Leaders of three more tribes have signed a treaty guiding restoration of buffalo populations in the U.S. and Canada. The International Buffalo Treaty was the first cross-border tribal treaty in more than 150 years when it was established in 2014. The treaty now has more than 30 signatories. This week, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe of Wyoming, Oglala Lakota Tribe of South Dakota and Frog Lake First Nation of Alberta, Canada, joined during a meeting in Chico Hot Springs, Montana. Jason Baldes with the Eastern Shoshone told Wyoming Public Radio the treaty reconnects buffalo to indigenous people and helps ensure buffalo are treated with “utmost respect.” An Eastern Shoshone herd established on Wyoming’s Wind River Indian Reservation in 2016 has grown from 10 to 33 buffalo.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/12/feeding-front-line-whooping-cranes-stadium-crowds-news-around-states/115463634/", "title": "Feeding the front line, whooping cranes: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Vaccines against COVID-19 will soon be available at more than 70 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across Alabama, the company and the state announced. The retailer said people who meet the state’s eligibility requirements can begin signing up for appointments, and the immunizations begin Friday. Part of the program’s aim is to get the vaccine into areas without adequate medical services, the company said. That includes the south Alabama town of Brewton, which the company said was chosen to get the vaccine because other immunization sites are so far away. More than 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies in Alabama and 21 other states are receiving federal vaccine allocations this week. Gov. Kay Ivey said the state was grateful for the doses but urged patience since each store will have a limited supply of vaccine. The state on Monday expanded vaccine eligibility to include everyone 65 and older, school workers, grocery store employees, some manufacturers, public transit workers, agriculture employees, state legislators and constitutional officers. As many as 1.5 million people now qualify for shots, up from about 700,000 previously.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is expanding eligibility for COVID-19 vaccinations to people 50 and older with high-risk medical conditions, prekindergarten through grade 12 teachers and child care workers, and those 50 and older in jobs considered essential who work in close proximity to others. The state health department announced the expansion Wednesday. It said people in those groups can start making appointments Thursday. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a statement, said many Alaskans in the 65-and-older age group who wanted to receive vaccinations have, “and now it’s time to open up vaccinations to a new group of Alaskans.” Individuals previously eligible can still get vaccinated, officials say. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, said factors such as Alaska’s remaining allocation for February and estimates on how much vaccine the state might receive for March were weighed in making the decision to expand eligibility. The new tier includes people living or working in congregate settings who weren’t previously eligible, including homeless and domestic violence shelters and those in correctional settings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Facing complaints from advocates for people with disabilities, the state Senate is eyeing legislation that would bar hospitals from considering a person’s potential lifespan, quality of life or disability when the facilities are forced to ration care during the current or any future pandemic. The proposal from Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, instead would require hospitals that are assessing patients under state-adopted crisis standards of care to assess only a patient’s ability to survive the current hospitalization. Barto said at a hearing Wednesday that the current standards, adopted last year to address the COVID-19 pandemic, could discriminate against disabled people. But not everyone who testified at the Senate Health and Human Services Committee hearing backed the change. Dr. Patricia Mayer, director of clinical ethics at the Banner Health hospital chain, who was involved in drafting the current COVID-19 guidelines, said putting the new requirements into law could lock out future updates to the standards, which have been in place for nearly a decade. She said preventing doctors from judging who gets treatment without being able to consider their realistic lifespan could lead to absurd results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate on Wednesday approved a measure allowing medical providers to refuse to treat someone because of their religious or moral beliefs, a move critics say will allow them to turn LGBTQ patients away. The majority-Republican Senate voted 27-6 in favor of the measure, which says health care workers and institutions have the right to not participate in nonemergency treatments that violate their conscience. The proposal now heads to the House. Supporters of the bill said it would protect health care workers from being forced to perform something that goes against their conscience. “This bill is about elective things, things you can take time to find a provider who’s willing to offer the service rather than a force a provider who doesn’t believe in doing it,” said Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who sponsored the measure. Opponents said it would give wide berth to medical providers to use religious, moral or philosophical beliefs to deny care to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients. One opponent said it’s written so broadly that it could even allow someone to be denied service because of their political affiliation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden State has edged past New York in the grim statistic of the number of deaths due to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University data reported Thursday. California’s death toll reached 45,496, surpassing New York’s toll of 45,312, even as coronavirus trends are showing improvement in California. Meanwhile, a surge of coronavirus cases at the University of California, Berkeley has prompted school officials to extend a lockdown on about 2,000 students living in residence halls and ban them from outdoor exercise as part of strict new measures to curb the spread of infections. More than 400 people, mostly undergraduate students, at UC Berkeley have tested positive for the virus since an outbreak that started in mid-January, according to the university’s coronavirus dashboard. All students living in dorm-style residence halls were ordered to “self-sequester” in a lockdown initially put in place from Feb. 1-8. But this week, school officials extended the lockdown through at least Monday. “You may NOT leave your room for solo outdoor exercise,” an email said, noting this was a change from the previous week’s rules. The ban goes beyond strict guidelines issued by the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom has encouraged outdoor exercise, even during strict lockdown periods.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Businesses in the state have sold about $10 billion of marijuana since the plant was legalized for recreational use in 2014, according to new data released by the state Department of Revenue. The figures released Tuesday indicate that marijuana sales in 2020 hit an all-time high for one year with $2.19 billion in total revenue, up from $1.75 billion in 2019. Marijuana revenue from 2020 surpassed figures from 2019 by the end of October. “Ten billion is incredible and unsurprising at the same time,” said Truman Bradley, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, Colorado’s trade association. “The industry has partnered with regulators to do things the right way in Colorado.” Tax and fee revenue from marijuana sales since 2014 has totaled about $1.63 billion, the state said. Marijuana dispensaries collect 2.9% in state sales tax, 15% as a marijuana retail sales tax, and a 15% excise tax on wholesale sales or transfers of retail marijuana, the Colorado Sun reports. Fees are generated from license and application charges, while cities often add local sales taxes of about 20%.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: New and limited data released Wednesday from the state Department of Public Health suggests racial disparities in the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, mirroring what’s been happening in other states where Black populations lag far behind white populations in getting the shots. As of Feb. 3, nearly 2% of residents 75 and older who had received the vaccine were Black, while 59.7% were white, according to the data. Meanwhile, slightly more than 1% were Asian; 2.3% were Hispanic; 6.2% were mixed race; and 19.4% were listed as other, which includes American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. According to 2019 U.S. census data, 74.6% of Connecticut’s population is white, while 11% is only Black or African-American. “As we open up the vaccine program to individuals 65 and over, we are redoubling our efforts to ensure that vaccine is reaching the communities and populations who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,” DPH Acting Commissioner Dr. Deidre Gifford said. The department cautioned that there are some gaps in data reporting and that people can select “other,” “multiple races” or “not reported.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Local hip-hop musician and activist Amillion the Poet has offered up a sobering music video on YouTube about the pandemic titled “The Quarantine.” The song is a melodic reminder to wear masks and take COVID-19 seriously, especially since the country has eclipsed 400,000 coronavirus deaths. The video features a cameo from Amillion’s daughter, Aaliyah Adams-Mayfield. Amillion, whose real name is Lucas Amillion Mayfield, teamed up with director Jet Phynx Films on the track, along with national recording songstress Stacy Barthe and J’ne Indigo. The song can be found on the music project “Covid-1NA and Deluxe,” which is out now. Around 2009, Amillion survived as a single parent by traveling to poetry open mics around the country, mostly performing for free, while making money from selling his book of poetry, “Poetry in Motion Proceeds,” after his performances. In the span of two years, the Dover rapper averaged close to 100 gigs annually. Eventually, Amillion said, he didn’t want to get pigeonholed as just the poetry guy. So he began performing at churches, prisons and schools. The emcee finally made his debut at Firefly Music Festival in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents 65 and older are eligible to register for 2,500 COVID-19 vaccine appointment slots that opened Thursday, WUSA-TV reports. The appointments are also available to health professionals who work in the district and residents of Wards 5, 7 and 8 priority ZIP codes. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the demand is high, and appointments were expected to fill up quickly. Those eligible can register online at vaccinate.dc.gov or call the city’s vaccine hotline at 855-363-0333. Howard University Hospital also announced Thursday that it will open a clinic offering D.C. residents ages 65 and up their first and second doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. “It’s no secret that COVID-19 exposure and mortality rates in the communities that we serve are three times higher than the national average. And those who have unfortunately passed away from this deadly disease have been disproportionately people of color,” said Dr. Hugh E. Mighty, dean of the Howard University College of Medicine and vice president of clinical affairs. “This vaccine serves as a powerful tool in our ongoing fight to combat the virus, and the importance of administering it first to high-risk patient populations is a critical endeavor that I am proud to take on.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Local tourism officials are launching their first full-scale marketing campaign since the pandemic, aimed at tourists within driving distance in the Southeast. The $2.2 million advertising campaign launched this month is targeted for spring and summer travel to potential visitors living in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The campaign, called “The Wonder Remains,” includes TV ads, YouTube videos, digital ads, social media ads, e-newsletters and website content. Along with highlighting Orlando’s theme parks and restaurants, the campaign emphasizes the safety measures that have been taken at its tourist attractions to protect tourists from the coronavirus. “The Central Florida region has gone above and beyond to create a safe and sanitized guest experience,” said Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. “I believe this campaign will reach individuals who are prepared to travel to a well-prepared destination for much-needed recreation.” Before the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, Orlando was the most visited tourist destination in the U.S., attracting 75 million visitors in 2018.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers approved their changes to the current year’s budget Thursday, including more money for K-12 schools and public health, along with $1,000 bonuses for more than 50,000 state employees. The House and Senate agreed to the changes by overwhelming votes, sending the bill to Gov. Brian Kemp. A spokesperson said he would sign it. The measure spends $26.6 billion in state funds and $15.6 billion more in federal money in the current year ending June 30. Lawmakers agreed with Gov. Brian Kemp’s plan to restore $567 million to the state’s K-12 school funding formula, which was cut by $950 million last year when lawmakers feared a steeper drop in revenue. Overall, lawmakers cut $2.2 billion last June, or about 10% across the board. Kemp and legislative leaders have also announced a plan to pay $1,000 bonuses to state employees making less than $80,000 yearly. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, told House members Thursday that “simple words” are not enough to thank employees for their work during the coronavirus pandemic. “The savings we were able to capture there are the dollars we have put back in to say thank you to our state employees,” England said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A statewide moratorium on residential evictions is expected to be extended for another two months in a coronavirus emergency proclamation from the governor. Democratic Gov. David Ige also said federal stimulus funds will extend rental assistance to include utility financial aid that could help renters for up to a year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There are no plans to provide rent relief for commercial properties, a situation Ige said was challenging. He noted difficulty in trying establish moratoriums on evictions by owners of commercial properties “without unfairly advantaging one side.” Instead, Ige said he supports ongoing efforts to provide direct financial help to small businesses. The state Council on Revenues forecast an additional $300 million increase in revenue this year and is projecting an additional $2 billion over the next seven years, leading to a significant impact on the state’s financial planning, Ige said. An improved economy means previously announced 10% budget reductions across the state will fall to 2.5% for the state Department of Education, restoring $123 million to classrooms, he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation taking aim at limits on how many people can gather during the coronavirus pandemic cleared the state House on Wednesday, but it doesn’t appear likely to have any force. The House voted 55-15 to approve the measure triggered by lawmaker anger over restrictions on crowd sizes that the Idaho High School Activities Association set for the girls’ state basketball tournament this month. The association has limited the event to 1,800 fans in the 11,000-capacity Ford Idaho Center in Nampa, saying it’s intended to keep kids safe. Officials also said some schools wouldn’t send teams to participate if they felt kids were at risk because of the pandemic. The legislation targets Republican Gov. Brad Little’s health order last week that raised the limits on gatherings from 10 to 50. The resolution says the 50-person limit is “declared null, void, and of no force and effect.” However, the governor’s health order recommends, but doesn’t require, a 50-person limit, and there is no penalty for exceeding 50 people. Also, the Ford Idaho Center is owned by the city of Nampa, which has no size limits on crowds. Neither does Canyon County, where Nampa is located.\n\nIllinois\n\nQuincy: Residents under 65 years old with preexisting medical conditions will be eligible to receive vaccination to protect them against COVID-19, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Wednesday. The Phase 1B distribution plan opening Feb. 25 will follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccinating pregnant women and people with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sickle cell disease and other conditions. “Many of these people may already be eligible because they’re 65 and over or they’re in a covered profession, but those who are under 65 and live with comorbidities have an elevated risk of serious complications or even death if they contract COVID-19,” Pritzker said during a tour of a vaccination site in Quincy. The Pritzker administration said the expansion is possible due to increased federal vaccine shipments to the state. Pritzker said Illinois is making progress in adding more vaccination sites, with 517 vaccination locations established statewide. However, he conceded making an appointment requires patience because the state hasn’t received enough vaccines to provide for everyone who is eligible in Phase 1B.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb defended the constitutionality of his COVID-19 restrictions in response to an Indiana House vote this week to limit his emergency powers. At his weekly COVID-19 update Wednesday, Holcomb said he makes sure “anything” he mandates “passes constitutional muster,” after being asked his thoughts on the House vote to ban him from placing restrictions on in-person worship and allowing the General Assembly to decide whether to convene during an emergency. Holcomb declared a public health emergency March 6, the same day the state reported its first coronavirus case. He cited a state law that allowed him to declare a disaster emergency in 30-day increments. Religious services were ordered to switch online or limit services to 10 people at the beginning of the pandemic, before he reopened places of worship in May. “I want to make sure whatever changes we make are constitutional, and I think we all share that, but we’re coming from a lot of different angles,” Holcomb said. He twice said he wouldn’t go into specific line items and whether he agreed or disagreed with them, and he said the lawmakers still have the second half of the session to go.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Catholic Church apparently is the state’s largest recipient of money from the federal Paycheck Protection Program intended to help small businesses, a review of the program by the Des Moines Register shows. The finding comes as a new investigation by the Associated Press shows that the U.S. arm of the church received at least $3 billion through the forgivable loan program, even as many dioceses remained financially healthy. In Iowa, the church’s total was more than $50 million, including more than $40 million for the components for the four Catholic dioceses and $8.7 million more that went to four Catholic colleges controlled by other church entities. Those state and national totals appear to make a church with thousands of employees in Iowa alone the largest beneficiary both statewide and nationally of a program intended to help companies with fewer than 500 employees pay workers as the COVID-19 pandemic raged last summer. Church officials said the aid was necessary to prevent layoffs. Catholic officials lobbied the Trump administration to free religious organizations from the so-called affiliation rule that typically disqualifies applicants with more than 500 workers from being treated as a small business.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: School districts are rushing to vaccinate their teachers in preparation for an eventual return to a full reopening of classrooms and before a more contagious strain of the coronavirus can spread throughout the state. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature on Wednesday that about 60% of the state’s school districts have started vaccinating their teachers and staff. She met with top lawmakers a day after the state Department of Education recommended that school districts allow middle and high school students resume full-time in-person instruction if precautions are taken. Several of the state’s largest districts have been offering in-person classes only part time or teaching students only online. “The more we can get the vaccines in the arms of the folks who are teaching and taking care of our kids in our school buildings and day care centers, the more likely we will be able to bring them back safely and let them continue in person,” Kelly told legislative leaders. The state is inoculating teachers as part of its second round of vaccinations, which also extended eligibility to people ages 65 and older, prisoners, and essential workers such as law enforcement officers.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A bill that would limit the state’s authority to reduce class sizes at child care centers in an emergency won approval by a Senate committee Wednesday despite one member’s concerns that it could cause problems in a future disaster or disease outbreak. The legislation sponsored by Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, drew praise from child advocates because it streamlines the process for certifying and regulating family child care homes, where up to six children may receive care in a private residence. Kentucky Youth Advocates called it “an important first step for families seeking child care.” But a separate provision, reducing to 30 days the time the state could limit child care class sizes, drew objections from Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, a physician who said she was concerned about restrictions in the next “epidemic or pandemic.” Kelli Rodman, director of legislative affairs for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said her agency also opposes that provision. The restrictions on class sizes, part of COVID-19 emergency rules, have been a sore point for many child care providers because they require additional staffing and space at at time when many are struggling with other pandemic rules.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Hospitality industry workers who will lose income because of a bar shutdown and other coronavirus restrictions in the French Quarter can apply for five days of part-time work with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday. Bars are being shut down throughout the city Friday, the beginning of what is usually a raucous Mardi Gras weekend. And there will be limits on automobile and pedestrian traffic in the French Quarter, where bars usually cater to shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. In a $100,000 program, the city is offering up to 200 displaced workers jobs that officials say may include trash and litter pickup and mask distribution, according to a news release from Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration. Workers selected can earn up to $100 a day for five hours of work a day Friday through Tuesday. Affected workers can apply online and will need documentation including a state identification card and a paycheck stub.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A county commissioner is continuing a campaign to stop the enforcement of the state’s mandatory mask order, despite rulings by the state’s highest court that the orders are legal. Androscoggin County Commissioner Isaiah Lary, a Republican, is involved in a spat with state officials over mask rules. He proposed a resolution Wednesday stating that no county official can enforce masking orders in the county, which is home to Lewiston, the state’s second-largest city. Lary also wants the county administrator to ask the Maine Supreme Judicial Court for a declaration that the orders are unconstitutional, the Sun Journal reports. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has already told the county that the state’s masking orders are constitutional. Frey sent a letter to commissioners last week saying that “counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions have no authority to exempt themselves from executive orders, and any effort to do so would be of no legal effect,” the Sun Journal reports. The Androscoggin County Commission could vote on Lary’s proposed resolution at a Feb. 17 meeting. Lary is one of three commissioners facing a potential recall vote over their opposition to masking orders.\n\nMaryland\n\nBel Air: Harford County wants the state to use Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen as a mass COVID-19 vaccination site, noting that doses are being held back in the jurisdiction after large-scale vaccination sites opened in Baltimore City and Prince George’s County. A letter from Harford County officials to the acting secretary of health said the stadium’s proximity to Interstate 95 and Route 40 would allow Marylanders easy access to the site, The Baltimore Sun reports. County Health Officer David Bishai said more than 40,000 county residents are preregistered to receive the vaccine. But Bishai told the county council Tuesday that because of the limited supply of first doses, Harford is giving about 200 first doses a day. Ripken Stadium, used for a mass testing clinic in August, has a large parking lot and refrigeration but no ultra-cold refrigerators needed to store Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford said in a video meeting Wednesday that additional mass vaccination sites are in the works for M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore and in southern Maryland, western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore. Northern Maryland and Harford County specifically weren’t mentioned.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is opening two additional mass vaccination sites this month, in Natick and Dartmouth, Gov. Charlie Baker said Wednesday. The announcement came as 74,000 appointments were scheduled to be posted online for mass vaccination sites and pharmacies at locations statewide Thursday. An additional 30,000 appointments will be posted over the course of the week at pharmacies, for a total of more than 100,000 new appointments this week. The Natick location will open Feb. 22 at the Natick Mall and will begin administering 500 doses per day, accelerating over the course of several weeks to 3,000 doses daily. The Dartmouth location is scheduled to open Feb. 24 at Circuit City. It will begin administering 500 doses per day, increasing over several weeks to more than 2,000 daily. Also beginning Thursday at mass vaccination sites, caregivers who are accompanying a person 75 or older may schedule their own vaccination at the same time and location. Only one caregiver is permitted to schedule an appointment with the older resident. Caregivers may receive their first dose even if the older resident is receiving their second dose.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday proposed a $67 billion state budget that she said would aid Michigan’s pandemic recovery by solidifying new programs to expand eligibility for free community college tuition, bolstering child care assistance and boosting local bridge repairs. The Democratic governor’s spending blueprint also calls for $570 million to address learning loss and K-12 enrollment declines on top of a $162-per-student, or 2%, increase in base aid for most traditional districts in the next fiscal year. Better-funded districts would get $82 more per student, roughly 1%. More immediate coronavirus-related needs, such as vaccine distribution, would be funded with multibillion-dollar supplemental spending bills – primarily through the release of federal COVID-19 relief aid that Whitmer has been urging lawmakers to pass soon. She said she focused on three priorities: economic reengagement that “drives everything,” a return to in-person instruction at schools and vaccine dissemination. She wants to double spending on Futures for Frontliners, which covers community college tuition for essential workers who worked in the early months of the pandemic, to include those who lost their jobs when her administration reinstated business restrictions to curb surging infections in the late fall.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials on Wednesday unveiled their plan to deal with toxic man-made “forever chemicals” that are polluting Minnesota’s waters and causing growing concerns about potential health risks. The pharmaceuticals, microplastics and synthetic chemicals are known collectively as PFAS and are used in a variety of consumer products because of their durability and resistance to heat and water. An increasing number of scientists have linked some PFAS to negative health effects in humans, such as low birth weight, thyroid and kidney problems, and some cancers. “These forever chemicals are everywhere,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner Laura Bishop said in a Zoom meeting that included leaders from other state agencies, lawmakers and environmental activists. “And new PFAS are being invented, used in industry and incorporated into commercial products, and released into the environment every day.” The Minnesota PFAS Blueprint calls for the state to enact stronger regulations, including designating more than 5,000 different chemicals as hazardous substances under Minnesota’s Superfund law.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is spending $5million of federal coronavirus aid to appoint eight senior judges to help reduce the backlog in the Hinds County court system. A temporary courtroom will be set up in the Woolfolk State Office Building across the street from the state Capitol. The announcement was made by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Randolph during a Wednesday press conference. The backlog in the court system has been driven by a historic rise in violent crime in Jackson amid the COVID-19 pandemic. There were more than 125 homicides reported in Jackson alone in 2020. There are currently thousands of backlogged cases in Hinds County, Randolph said during the briefing. According to the Ledger, Hosemann said even among cases in which an individual has been indicted by a grand jury, there are hundreds that haven’t made it to trial. The backlog has kept those cases from making it to court.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers are considering several bills that would allow Missourians to keep unemployment benefits they were given if they did not intentionally commit fraud. The House Special Committee on Government Oversight on Wednesday heard seven proposals on the issue. The committee chairman said the bills will be combined into one proposal, and the committee will likely vote on it early next week. The discussion comes after Gov. Mike Parson has said people should “most certainly” be required to return payments they mistakenly received. Most of the proposals focused on unemployment funds from the federal government because national stimulus packages allow states to waive repayment. Lawmakers said 75%-80% of the overpayments are federal funds. No committee members or witnesses objected to the idea, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Several options were discussed on how to recoup the 20%-25% of the payments that are from state funds. One bill would prohibit the state from collecting the funds, while other committee members suggested the state could cover the cost of repayment or use federal coronavirus relief money to reduce the economic loss for the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Saying he will lift a statewide mask requirement this week, Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill Wednesday intended to protect businesses and health care providers from coronavirus-related lawsuits. Gianforte said the new law will allow businesses to open safely during the pandemic. He also said enough vulnerable Montana residents have received COVID-19 vaccinations to allow the lifting Friday of the mask mandate put in place in July by his Democratic predecessor, Steve Bullock. Still, Gianforte said he would continue to wear a mask for the time being and encouraged others to do so. Local jurisdictions will still be permitted to implement mask mandates after the statewide rule is lifted. As of Wednesday, more than 41,000 Montana residents – representing just under 4% of the population – had received both doses of a vaccine. The state is still in the midst of the second phase of vaccinations, with doses available only to people 70 or older, those with severe underlying medical conditions, and people of color who are at greater risk if they contract the virus. Gianforte’s announcement came as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned against lifting broad mask requirements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state should see at least 43 retail pharmacies participating in a new federal program to help provide COVID-19 vaccinations, although state officials don’t have a good way to communicate with all of them to avoid mistakes, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. Ricketts said he’s grateful for the additional 5,700 doses Nebraska will get through the federal program but voiced concerns about how all the different businesses will coordinate with the state’s efforts. He said the federal program didn’t include a clear way for states and the retailers to ensure they’re on the same page. “This is an area we do have concerns about,” Ricketts, a Republican, said at a news conference to discuss the state’s pandemic response. The coordination is critical to ensure “good information is going back and forth between those pharmacies and the state so that we can keep track of who’s been vaccinated.” Retailers participating in the program include Walmart and independent pharmacies throughout the state. Walmart announced Tuesday that it will start vaccinations Friday at more than a dozen of its Nebraska stores, all in smaller cities outside Omaha, Lincoln and Grand Island.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Distance runners will cover a shorter course when the Rock ’n’ Roll race series returns to the Las Vegas Strip in a year, tourism and event officials said Tuesday. The marathon was cut to a half-marathon under a three-year, $450,000 agreement approved by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board. Elizabeth O’Brien, managing director of North America for Rock ’n’ Roll, called it a next chapter for the event. She said a three-day health and fitness expo will be held ahead of the half-marathon, now set for Feb. 27, 2022. The contract through hometown Las Vegas Events also includes Rock ’n’ Roll Las Vegas races in 2023 and 2024. The event traces its origin to a marathon run since 1967 in and around Las Vegas. It moved to the Las Vegas Strip in 2005 and became a Rock ’n’ Roll series race in 2009, featuring music and entertainment along the course. Held in November in recent years, it has attracted tens of thousands of runners annually for fun-run, 5-kilometer, 10-kilometer, 13.1-mile and 26.2-mile distances. The unusual nighttime race begins and ends on the neon-lit Las Vegas Strip and includes the downtown Fremont Street Experience casino mall. Races in 2020 and 2021 were canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: With coronavirus case counts on the decline and fewer hospitalizations in the state, the governor’s reopening task force on Thursday looked ahead to summer and recommended updated guidance for camp operators that includes keeping children in small groups and more preparation for arrivals and pickups. Gov. Chris Sununu would need to approve the task force’s recommendations, which also include lifting some restrictions for restaurants and bars on the use of pool and billiard tables, dartboards and karaoke. The group also plans to include new members from industries that have been hit particularly hard, such as performing arts and outdoor entertainment venues, and the wedding industry. Regarding camps, staff working at overnight camps would quarantine on site for 10 days. Campers attending from outside New England would self-quarantine at home or in New Hampshire before arriving at camp. Staff and children also would undergo virus tests seven days before they arrive, when they get to camp, and then about five to seven days later. Only four of the state’s 95 overnight summer camps opened last summer because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 vaccine call center will stop booking appointments temporarily because agents were making too many mistakes such as double-booking patients, state officials said Wednesday. Since the call center opened two weeks ago, only 600 appointments had been booked by early this week despite the center being inundated with hundreds of thousands of callers. The 250 agents who operate the phone line – 855-568-0545 – will have more training on using the state’s appointment system, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said at Wednesday’s briefing. “We found that it is not as easy as we thought it would be,” she said. The center, which opened Jan. 25, has been inundated with hundreds of thousands of callers, only 50,000 of whom have gotten through to an operator. Many callers are seniors seeking appointments after not being able to obtain one on various state and private online portals. Demand skyrocketed in mid-January when Gov. Phil Murphy opened eligibility to more than 4 million New Jerseyans including those 65 and older, those with underlying conditions and smokers. The state has only been receiving about 200,000 doses a week.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials on Wednesday said they would be ending mandatory self-quarantine requirements for visitors and residents arriving in the state, as more counties have reported less spread of the coronavirus over the past two weeks. More than half of the state’s 33 counties have emerged from strict lockdown – earning favorable yellow and green ratings on a color-coded map – as test positivity rates decline. That opens permission for limited indoor dining at restaurants, though movie theaters, bars and contact recreational facilities remain closed statewide. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham sounded an optimistic note about progress against COVID-19 during an online news conference, noting that average daily deaths, infections and hospitalizations were declining. “Today is a day to really feel good about the collective efforts of the state,” Lujan Grisham said. She acknowledged a one-day surge in virus-related deaths with 31 on Wednesday. Health officials also confirmed that the state’s allotment of vaccine doses from the federal government will increase next week to about 61,000, a more than 8% increase from last week.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Large arenas and stadiums can soon reopen for sports and entertainment at 10% of their normal capacity under a plan announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday, despite concern from public health experts about still-high rates of coronavirus infections and the threat of more contagious variants. Cuomo said major stadiums and arenas with a capacity of 10,000 people or more can reopen with limited spectators starting Feb. 23. The Barclays Center, which has about 17,700 seats for basketball games, has already received state approval to reopen Feb. 23 for the Brooklyn Nets’ home game against the Sacramento Kings. And the New York Knicks and New York Rangers said they plan to host about 2,000 fans at every game, starting with Feb. 23 and Feb. 26 games at Madison Square Garden. A New York Yankees spokesperson called Cuomo’s announcement an “encouraging first step.” But CUNY School of Public Health epidemiology professor Denis Nash said the state’s approach lacks a scientific basis when “community prevalence is very high.” He and other public health experts pointed to evidence that COVID-19 spreads more easily indoors and to the risk of people sitting near others who may be cheering or taking masks off while eating.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Wednesday afternoon that educators and support staff will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine starting Feb. 24 as part of a staggered rollout of the state’s next phase of distribution. The Democratic governor estimated about 240,000 people would become eligible in two weeks. The group includes child care workers, pre-K to 12th grade principals and teachers at public, private and charter schools, and support staff, such as janitors, bus drivers and cafeteria workers. “Moving to the next phase is good news. The challenge continues to be the very limited supply of the vaccine,” Cooper said. Other groups the state considers “front-line essential workers” will start becoming eligible March 10, though public health officials are still evaluating whether it will prioritize certain subgroups within that population. That group includes manufacturing workers, grocery store clerks, college and university instructors and support staff, farmers, restaurant workers, mail carriers, court workers, elected officials, homeless shelter staff, public health workers, social workers, firefighters, EMS personnel, police officers, public transit workers and several others.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses being delivered to North Dakota is increasing. The state will receive a 5% increase in vaccine doses allocated, according to Gov. Doug Burgum. North Dakota will receive 7,500 doses next week, up from 6,900 this week. Also, Thrifty White pharmacies in the state will be getting the vaccine starting this week as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The state’s immunization program manager, Molly Howell, said 16 of the 30 Thrifty White locations in North Dakota have registered to receive the vaccine. According to the company’s vaccination registration website, its pharmacies are inoculating people 65 and older. North Dakotans who want to be vaccinated may need to go somewhere besides their traditional health care provider, Howell said. Pharmacies, local public health departments and private health care providers all are offering vaccines. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, North Dakota’s rate of vaccine doses administered remains among the highest in the country, No. 3, at 17,030 people per 100,000 population.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The discovery of as many as 4,000 unreported COVID-19 deaths came as the Health Department reconciled an internal death certificate database with a federal database, the state auditor’s office said Thursday. Republican Auditor Keith Faber has been auditing Health Department coronavirus death data since September. But the agency didn’t have access to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s infectious diseases database because of federal health privacy laws, said Matt Eiselstein, Faber’s communications director. “We were never able to make that reconciliation ourselves to come up with those figures,” Eiselstein said. The final audit is expected next month. The Ohio Department of Health said those deaths will now be added to the state’s tally of deaths from the coronavirus during the coming week. Thursday’s coronavirus death toll showed more than 720 deaths, of which 650 come from previously unreported deaths, Gov. Mike DeWine said. “We hope, we believe, that is going to put us back from the track where we actually are,” DeWine said. The Health Department said that “process issues affecting the reconciliation and reporting of these deaths” began in October, with most occurring in November and December.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first bill signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt during the current legislative session allows public bodies to continue meeting virtually as a coronavirus safety precaution. The law signed Wednesday allows public bodies to meet virtually through February 2022 or until the expiration of the governor’s executive emergency order on COVID-19, whichever comes first. “We’ve all heard from constituents, state agencies, local school boards and other public bodies requesting this, and I’m pleased we were able to deliver so quickly,” Stitt said in a statement. The bill by Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat was passed by the state Senate on Feb. 3 and by the House five days later. “With the signing of this bill, public entities can continue to meet and do so safely until the pandemic is behind us, and the people of Oklahoma maintain access to public meetings at all levels through virtual meetings,” Treat said. Lawmakers last year allowed for virtual meetings, but those provisions expired in November. Rather than convene in a special session, Republican legislative leaders agreed to address the issue at the start of the session.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The week after Christmas, with coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations soaring, morale was low at Oregon Health & Science University, the state’s largest hospital. Doctors and nurses caring for the most critically ill were burning out just when they were needed the most. Then, the food started coming: hot, delicious, individually wrapped meals from some of the city’s trendiest restaurants, a buffet of cuisines from Chinese to Italian to Lebanese to Southern comfort food. For staffers who only took off their N95 masks once to eat during a 12-hour shift, the meals were more than just food – they were emotional sustenance. “It’s almost like having a weight lifted. It’s like getting a surprise dozen roses or something,” nurse Alice Clark said. “We’re so grateful.” But the meals, paid for by a wellness grant from the Oregon-based insurance fund SAIF, also served another purpose: They kept struggling restaurants afloat. “It’s kept the doors open and a small workforce employed. It’s been the most heartfelt catering we’ve ever done,” said Kiauna Floyd, third-generation owner of Amalfi’s, a Portland institution that’s been serving up Italian cuisine for 62 years. For now, though, meal deliveries to OHSU have dried up with the grant funding, and the program ended Jan. 19. Leaders are hoping for a new funding source to get meals running again soon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBeaver: In the first six weeks of vaccine distribution in Pennsylvania, residents in a handful of counties had no chance of getting inoculated against COVID-19 without leaving their home county. An analysis of state data found that four rural counties didn’t receive any doses in the first six weeks of the bungled rollout, and the majority of doses were sent to health care systems that focused solely on inoculating employees. More than a third of vaccine doses sent out through late January went to three counties: Allegheny, Lehigh and Montgomery, which together are home to 2.4 million people. Removing Philadelphia County from the equation – it receives its vaccine doses directly from the federal government rather than the state – those three counties comprise 21.5% of Pennsylvania’s population. The state uses a formula to determine how to allocate vaccine among counties and providers based on the previous allocation of vaccine, the amount on hand for distribution, the amount administrated, the population, the amount of the population 65 and older, the percent positivity for coronavirus tests and the death rate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The city’s school district, which had largely resisted pressure to bring students back to the classroom, has approved a plan to resume in-person learning for most children. The plan approved Tuesday night by the Pawtucket School Committee calls for bringing back elementary school students March 1, middle school students March 15 and high school students on a hybrid schedule March 29. Only preschoolers, kindergartners and students in special populations had been approved for school in person. The school committee was under pressure from many parents, who rallied last weekend in support of in-person learning. The teachers’ union, which had previously been opposed to in-person instruction, said it now supports in-person learning for elementary students but not high school students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreer: While many people grapple with whether to wear two face masks or one, the operator of a local company that’s producing 25,000 three-layer disposable masks every day says one will do. “You don’t have to do that, doubling of a mask,” said Rick Gehricke, chief operating officer of Carolina Facemask and PPE. “If you have a mask certified to international standards, you don’t have to.” Carolina Face Mask & PPE was born more than a year ago from a Greer company founded in 1999 called Advanced Testing Instruments Corp., headed by Tim Ziegenfus. The business provides advanced testing of products in the textile, chemical, plastic, automotive, aerospace, paper, military, medial, foam and packaging industries. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last March, the company ramped up production of three-ply, Level 1 PPE face masks, and business took off. Spokesperson Katlyn Searcy said with the recent surge in coronavirus cases, many people still don’t realize a small business in Greer is doing its part to fight the pandemic. “People are starting to ask more questions about masks and their effectiveness,” Searcy said. “There are also concerns of more PPE shortages as the curve is trending up again.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Lawmakers are working to memorialize one of their own whom they lost last year to COVID-19. The late Bob Glanzer died in April while still serving as a member of the state House of Representatives after a short battle with coronavirus. Representing District 22, Glanzer was known as “Mr. Huron” for his community involvement in his hometown over his 74 years and a well-respected legislator among not just his fellow Republicans but Democrats as well. And with Gov. Kristi Noem’s pushing legislators to sign off on her plan to set aside $12 million to help the South Dakota State Fair construct a new multipurpose livestock and equestrian facility at the fairgrounds in Huron, House Speaker Spencer Gosch wants to use the opportunity to honor his late friend and colleague’s legacy. “His life was basically servitude to his community, and it shouldn’t go unnoticed,” he said after pitching his plan to state appropriators Tuesday afternoon. Gosch called the situation “fast moving” and said it’s not known what a Glanzer memorial might look like. It could be anything from a sculpture or a plaque to naming the Dakota Events Complex, as the governor has been referring to the project, after him, he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Public health officials announced Wednesday that 975 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine that went missing were likely thrown out by accident. Knox County said the state’s Department of Health confirmed the doses were shipped to the region last week, but local officials said they have no record of receiving them. Knox County Health Department Director Dr. Martha Buchanan said that based on GPS data, she believes the box containing the doses was probably discarded by someone who thought they were throwing out dry ice. Due to security reasons, vaccine doses are shipped without any readily identifiable information attached. “It was a kick in the gut for all of us,” Buchanan said through tears. “I apologize. Vaccinating our community is very important to us.” County officials have asked for a state investigation even though Buchanan said there was no indication of foul play. A key question remains why the GPS and temperature monitors attached to the Moderna vaccines did not work, Buchanan said. “Why were we the ones who found this out?” she asked.\n\nTexas\n\nAustwell: The coronavirus pandemic has canceled this year’s flights to count the only natural flock of whooping cranes – the first time in 71 years that crews in Texas couldn’t make an aerial survey of the world’s rarest cranes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has records of such surveys for every year starting in 1950, Wade Harrell, whooping crane recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an email Wednesday. The flock breeds in Canada and winters on and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, where the survey is made. Current protocols call for about six flights, each with a pilot and at least two observers – often coming from different parts of the country – in the close quarters of a small plane, Harrell said. “We decided to forgo the aerial survey this winter with COVID-19 cases currently spiking,” he said in a news release. At 5 feet high from their black feet to the little red caps on their heads, whooping cranes are the tallest birds in North America, and their wingspan, at more than 7 feet, is wider than a full-size pickup truck. They mate for life. Only about 825 exist – most of them in the natural flock, which is also the only one that doesn’t need human help to keep its numbers up. Habitat loss and hunting had cut that flock to 15 in 1941.\n\nUtah\n\nPanguitch: Just off this small city’s main road is a small, unassuming building that houses the local office for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. On a clear, chilly day in early January, dozens of Garfield County residents crowded around the entrance waiting to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The people in line ranged from young to old – teachers to first responders. In the back, Robin McMullin, a supervisor with the health department, was laser-focused as she filled up syringes with the Moderna vaccine. “I feel like it’s liquid gold. I seriously do,” McMullin told KUER-FM. “I don’t want to waste one drop of it.” Garfield County, with just over 5,000 people, has seen nearly 400 cases of COVID-19 – more than one in every dozen people have had the disease. Sheriff Danny Perkins said the spread of the coronavirus really picked up this fall at the county jail. About two thirds of the inmates got it, though there weren’t any serious cases among the prisoners. “But it got out in our staff, and it was devastating,” Perkins said. “There were days that I was ten people down, and when you take ten officers off of an office my size, that’s huge.” As of Feb. 2, nine people in Garfield County had died of COVID-19, making it second in the state for deaths per capita. The community has missed out on big life moments like funerals as well as more casual moments, like getting together at high school basketball games. “It’s a social gathering to get caught up on all the gossip to see how everybody’s doing,” Perkins said. “And it’s been taken away because of this disease.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city has a helpline for seniors who don’t have access to technology or transportation to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The state is now in its third week of immunizing Vermonters 75 and older. The nonprofit Age Well VT is working with the city to help seniors register for an appointment to get their first dose or to get an at-home vaccination, if necessary, WCAX-TV reports. One of the biggest concerns is getting home-bound Vermonters vaccinated, city leaders said. “It may seem to some of us like this information is everywhere, but we know we have not reached all seniors. Even in this very high-risk population, there are still significant number of those who have not yet signed up,” Mayor Miro Weinberger said Wednesday. Black Vermonters also are a large part of the age group who have not been vaccinated. Burlington’s Trusted Community Voices Program is working with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont and other groups to help educate and encourage more people of color to get their first dose, the station reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: Christopher Newport University is in the middle of its largest wave of coronavirus cases this school year, and one official put the blame on students not following rules instead of the return to in-person classes. As of Wednesday, 129 students and six employees at Christopher Newport had active cases, The Virginian-Pilot reports. On average, 171 students were in quarantine each day last week, or about 3.5% of the student body. In a letter to students and employees Monday, Kevin Hughes, vice president for student affairs, blamed the rising numbers on students. “What is happening on our campus right now is a stark reminder that individual behavior can have a profound and lasting impact,” Hughes wrote. “When you socialize with little concern, and in some cases reckless disregard, for who it hurts, everybody is impacted.” Some students said the message was condescending and want to see the university take more concrete actions to limit gatherings. Most colleges across the state have dozens or hundreds of active cases. More than 20% of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute are in isolation or quarantine. At William & Mary, cases are also rising sharply, with 79 reported this semester through Tuesday, surpassing last semester’s total in the span of a few weeks.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously rejected a recall effort against the Thurston County sheriff, saying his announcement that he would not criminally enforce the Health Department’s COVID-19 mask mandate was not unreasonable. Resident Arthur West sought to recall Sheriff John Snaza, alleging that Snaza’s news release last June saying his office would not engage in criminal enforcement of the mandate interfered with a lawful order, and a trial court agreed. But the justices overturned that decision Thursday. The Health Department’s order requiring masks in any public setting said violators “may” be subject to criminal penalties. That language gave Snaza discretion in how to enforce the mandate, the court said. The decision noted that Snaza did not generally undermine the mandate: He said his office would continue to work with health officials to educate the public, and he encouraged people to take safety precautions such as wearing masks. Not directly citing or arresting people was reasonable because doing so could risk transmission of the virus, the justices said. They contrasted Snaza’s actions with those of Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney, against whom the court is allowing a recall petition to proceed. Fortney said he had “no intention of carrying out enforcement for a stay-at-home directive” and encouraged business owners to remain open, in violation of the state’s directions.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Three events for youth in the state have been canceled for the second consecutive year due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The Make It Shine Earth Day Celebration, West Virginia Youth Environmental Day and state Junior Conservation Camp have all been canceled, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said in a news release. The events were also canceled in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions. The Earth Day Celebration is usually held in late April in Charleston, drawing hundreds of grade school-age children for hands-on environmental education, the release said. Youth Environmental Day had been set for May 15 in Ritchie County. Young people are recognized during the event for projects that benefit the environment and their communities. The projects will still be judged and winners recognized. Junior Conservation Camp was scheduled for June 21-25 at Cedar Lakes in Ripley. Nearly 200 campers ages 11 to 14 usually participate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee approved a bill Wednesday that would cut taxes by $540 million by the middle of 2023, largely by eliminating taxes on federal loans to businesses to help them through the pandemic. The full Legislature could vote to pass it as soon as Tuesday. Democrats on the budget committee argued that the bill cost too much and was another handout to businesses that took the loans but still flourished during the pandemic. “We’re punching a big hole in the budget,” Rep. Evan Goyke said. “We can direct our relief in a more targeted, more efficient manner.” Republicans countered that the bill brings state tax code in line with federal code. “This isn’t everyone’s dream tax bill,” said Rep. Mark Born, a committee co-chair. “This bill matches federal law. Of course it’s not perfect.” Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, would have to sign the bill for the tax cut to take effect. Asked whether Evers would veto the measure, his spokeswoman, Britt Cudaback, responded with a statement from the governor saying he would keep doing everything he can to support small businesses during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Coal Creek coal mine says it will shut down, making it the second mine in the Powder River Basin to announce this year that it’s closing. St. Louis, Missouri-based Arch Resources Inc., owner of the Wyoming mine, made the announcement Tuesday as the company transitions away from thermal coal generation toward coking coal, a type of coal used to make steel and other products, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Arch Resources said it plans to wind down operations at the mine near Gillette and begin cleaning up the site over the next two years. The company said it lost $78.5 million in the final quarter of last year. The Coal Creek mine produced about 2 million tons of its lower heat value coal last year, 73% less than in 2018. The mines in the Powder River Basin produce about 40% of the nation’s coal, but production has declined in part because of a push for natural gas and renewable energy. Montana’s Decker coal mine, also in the Powder River Basin, closed last month. Production losses from coal companies have led to rising unemployment and worsening state revenue shortfalls. The coronavirus pandemic also lowered demand for coal.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/02/kub-breaks-ground-knoxvilles-first-community-solar-array/9615158002/", "title": "Windy Hill Farm and Preserve launches Summer Concert Series ...", "text": "Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nWindy Hill Farm and Preserve launches Summer Concert Series, opens to public\n\nWindy Hill Farm and Preserve will host a Summer Concert Series to celebrate the season, present music from regional and nationally recognized artists and introduce guests to the newly expanded East Tennessee resort.\n\nLocated in Loudon, Windy Hill Farm and Preserve is an all-inclusive boutique resort with accommodations ranging from nine private cabins to an eight-room guesthouse and a spacious farmhouse for groups and large families.

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

(Tuesday, June 7, 2022) — Summer must be on the way! School is out, temperatures are quickly climbing, and a popular promotion has returned to Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country. During Sevier County Days, anyone who lives or works in Sevier County can visit their favorite hometown theme park or water park for just $5, while also helping their neighbors at the same time.\n\nSevier County Days takes place June 13-19 at Dollywood theme park and now-June 12 at Dollywood’s Splash Country water park. Residents and workers in the county can visit the award-winning parks for a $5 donation to Sevier County Food Ministries. All proceeds from the visits go to the food ministries, helping the non-profit provide support within the community.\n\n“We are always proud to partner with Jim Davis and his phenomenal staff at Sevier County Food Ministries,” said Carol Agee, Dollywood Community Affairs and Philanthropy Manager. “As kids are now out of school for summer, demand for the food ministries increases because those school lunches aren’t available for families who need them. We encourage families in that situation to visit the food ministry because the team there does an exemplary job of assisting those in the community who need it. We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth. Those who work in Sevier County but are not residents must present proof of employment as well as a state- or federally-issued photo identification matching the paycheck stub. Full details and eligible zip codes also are available by visiting Dollywood.com/SevierCountyDays.\n\nAs an added bonus for making the donation to the food ministries, the Sevier County Days ticket receives full upgrade value toward the purchase of a 2022 season pass.\n\nDollywood first started giving to Sevier County Food Ministries in 1998. Since that time, total contributions to the food ministry are more than $1.4 million. In addition to monetary support, Sevier County Food Ministries always accepts passionate volunteers ready to serve others through their efforts. For more information about how to volunteer, please visit seviercountyfoodministries.org.\n\nDollywood celebrates a year full of exceptional experiences, with each season unlike the next. It’s the perfect year for a season pass, as guests will want to return throughout the year to enjoy it all. Up next, guests can enjoy Dollywood’s Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration (June 18-August 7), which includes the return of Sweet Summer Nights—the evening fireworks and drone show—as well as Gazillion Bubble Show Aurora. Thousands of pumpkins glow to life as part of the Harvest Festival presented by Humana (Sept. 23-Oct. 29), and Smoky Mountain Christmas presented by Humana (Nov. 5- Jan. 1, 2023) celebrates the spirit of the season.\n\nFor more information about Dollywood, please visit dollywood.com or download the Dollywood App.\n\nUScellular donates $86,000 in wireless hotspots and service to YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (June 7, 2022) – To help provide equitable learning and keep local youth connected, UScellular has donated 75 wireless hotspots and two years of service to YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley as part of the After School Access Project, which provides assistance to nonprofits that support youth with safe internet access for homework and education. The donation provides a total value of $86,000 for the organization.\n\n“The success of students in the communities we serve is important to us at UScellular,” said Thomas White, director of sales for East Tennessee. “Connecting people and communities is our mission and the After School Access Project is just one way that we’re helping ensure students have the reliable access they need to grow and pursue their dreams.”\n\nThrough the After School Access Project, the company has pledged to donate up to $13 million in hotspots and service to help up to 50,000 youth connect to reliable internet in its markets. To date, the company has donated more than 3,800 hotspots, a value of $3.7 million, to its communities through this initiative. Eligible 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations can apply at AfterSchoolAccessProject.com.\n\nWith a mission to eliminate racism and empower women, YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley has been a leading force of community change since 1899.

YWCA’s Phyllis Wheatley Center serves hundreds of middle and high school youth through innovative, life-changing after-school and summer programs.\n\n“The students we serve are among Knoxville’s most vulnerable and are oftentimes low-income and at high risk for dropping out of school,” said Rachel Haverkamp, CEO of YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley. “Access to the internet creates opportunities for educational success and a chance to improve our neighborhoods and communities. Our organization will use the hotspots to support on-site programming, create opportunities for off-site learning and exploration and support students’ independent and group work at home.”\n\nHotspots are stand-alone Wi-Fi networks that can connect several devices at once wirelessly and have proven to be a vital tool for youth to access the internet, study and complete homework. The hotspots provided through After School Access Project connect to UScellular’s network to provide high-speed connectivity for youth throughout East Tennessee.\n\nUScellular is focused on addressing gaps in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and is committed to connecting more than 200,000 of tomorrow’s innovators each year with the resources they need today to help shape future opportunities.

Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

A consent decree with school officials in the east Alabama county, located on the Georgia line, the government and attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund includes construction of a new school and more opportunities for Black students in the county of roughly 35,000 people, officials said. The agreement was announced Friday to end a desegregation order that’s been in place since 1970. It followed a previous, interim agreement reached in 1993. “We are pleased to arrive at a consent decree that addresses the many concerns our clients raised as key to ensuring the effectiveness of the desegregation process in Chambers County,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund. “It was particularly important that Black students in the district are afforded equal and high-quality educational opportunities in safe and modern facilities.” Before the end of the next school year, the district must pick a site to build a new, consolidated high school to replace LaFayette High School, which is heavily Black, and Valley High School, which has a large population of white students.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had about 6,700 more jobs last month than a year earlier, but jobs in most sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the state labor department reported Friday. There were about 11,800 fewer jobs in April than in April 2019, the year before the pandemic, the department said. The biggest year-over-year gain was in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had about 3,900 more jobs last month than in April 2021. The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019. But there were 1,700 fewer jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, 1,100 fewer in leisure and hospitality, and 2,700 fewer in oil and gas last month than in April 2019. Karinne Wiebold, an economist with the department, said recently that Alaska began seeing year-over-year growth in total employment in April 2021, a year after the “initial employment shock” from the pandemic hit. She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: The city has preemptively adopted new rules regulating short-term rental properties before it welcomes a bevy of visitors for the 2023 Super Bowl. Ordinances approved by the Glendale City Council on May 10 amend the city’s codes on short-term rentals and nuisance parties. Owners of homes rented out for brief vacations must now provide contact information to the city in case law enforcement needs to reach them for an emergency or disturbance. Glendale’s ordinance additionally prohibits short-term rental properties from being used for operating as a retail enterprise or an adult-oriented business. Because Glendale currently doesn’t have a registry of short-term rental homes, local leaders say it’s difficult to know how much of a nuisance these properties are creating in the community, 12News reports. “It is possible that officers are responding to noise complaints at short-term rentals and just don’t know they are short-term rentals,” Deputy City Manager Rick St. John said during a council meeting. In another ordinance, Glendale’s police officers have the ability to assess fees to individuals hosting “nuisance parties,” or any social gathering that “constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The barrage of television ads and mailers leading up to Tuesday’s primary election makes the most influential Republicans in the state clear. Tom Cotton’s making the case for fellow U.S. Sen. John Boozman, talking up his conservative bona fides while the two-term senator fends off challenges from the right. Donald Trump’s image appears in ads for Boozman and for Sarah Sanders, who served as the ex-president’s White House press secretary and is now running for governor. Sanders, whose endorsement is almost as sought after as Trump’s, is helping make the closing argument for Boozman in a TV ad. But conspicuously missing from the ads and the campaign trail is the state’s top elected Republican, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is entering the final stretch of his term with strong approval ratings and a raised national profile. Hutchinson’s advisers say he’s concentrating on helping more Republicans nationally as he looks to the future – which might include a White House bid. Sanders has avoided publicly criticizing Hutchinson, even when her former boss labeled the outgoing governor a “RINO” – Republican in Name Only – for his decision to veto an anti-transgender law. Sanders said she would have signed the measure, which bans gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: New rules about how and when actors can use guns while filming failed to pass the Legislature on Thursday, just months after a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding went off and killed a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico. Democrats in California had filed two bills in response to the tragedy, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. With competing proposals, Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the author of one of the proposals, said he “strongly urged” entertainment industry groups to “work collaboratively to bring forward a consensus approach.” But no one did. On Thursday, Portantino decided to hold both bills in committee, meaning they are unlikely to pass the Legislature this year. “It’s a powerful and ruthless industry. First the industry killed Halyna. Then they killed the bill that would’ve made people like her safe,” said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat who authored the other proposal. Cortese’s bill would have banned the use of guns and blank ammunition containing gunpowder or other explosive charges from film sets, with some exceptions. Portantino’s bill would have allowed guns with blank ammunition on set, but only under the supervision of an armorer who has completed a state gun safety course.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A late spring snowstorm dumped several inches in the Denver metro area Saturday and knocked out electricity for about 210,000 customers, officials said. The wet snow weighed down tree branches and sent them toppling onto power lines, the television station KUSA reports. Much more snow fell in mountainous regions of Colorado. By Saturday night, power had been restored to 160,000 customers, but about 50,000 still did not have it back, the Xcel Energy Colorado utility said in a statement. The small Colorado community of Cripple Creek near the base of Pike’s Peak got 20 inches of snow, KUSA reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Eligible families can begin applying next month for the new one-year child tax rebate program that’s included in the newly revised state budget, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. Rebates of up to $250 per child are expected to be issued in late August. The rebates will be provided for up to three children per family. While any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child under the age of 18 on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible for the rebate, the amounts are dictated by income. To receive the maximum amount, the income threshold is $100,000 or less for those single or married filing separately; $169,000 or less for those filing as head of household; and $200,000 for those married filing jointly. Those with higher incomes may be eligible to receive a reduced rebate. The Department of Revenue Services will accept applications from June 1 through July 31. Families can apply online on the DRS website and click on the “2022 CT Child Tax Rebate” icon. DRS is reaching out about the program to more than 300,000 households in the state that may meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report by Amtrak’s inspector general found that the train service’s $41 million purchase of an office building in the city has failed to provide savings that were projected. Amtrak estimated it would save close to $50 million by consolidating operations in the building that it purchased in Wilmington in May 2020. But a report filed May 13 by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General found those savings haven’t materialized for a variety of reasons. Dispatching and police communications were supposed to be consolidated in the building, but that has not occurred because Amtrak has not yet been able to determine if the building can accommodate a large generator necessary to provide emergency power. In addition, Amtrak has been unable to move forward with a plan to move more than 400 information-technology workers to Wilmington. The report found that so many workers would refuse the transfer that operations would be unacceptably disrupted. Amtrak now estimates it won’t need as much space in the building as originally thought.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A moment of happiness and celebration at the Lincoln Memorial turned into a headache for workers with the National Park Service, WUSA-TV reports. The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed to the public Saturday morning after celebrating university graduates reportedly left a mess on the steps of the monument, a National Park Service official said. NPS tweeted a photo of the closure Saturday, claiming the graduation celebration left broken bottles, spilled wine and champagne covering the steps of the national monument. “We will reopen as soon as the area has been cleaned and made safe,” NPS said on Twitter. Facilities staff members worked through the morning and were able to clean the mess within a few hours. The Lincoln Memorial reopened about 11:30 a.m. NPS did not say from which school the celebrating graduates hailed, but many online theorize the students could be from Georgetown University. A spokesperson for the school called the incident “concerning and disappointing.” The spokesperson noted that Georgetown was one of many universities having ceremonies over the weekend and said it no university-sponsored events at or around the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: A billionaire developer from Dubai is set to purchase the site of a South Florida condominium that collapsed last June, killing 98 people, for $120 million after no other bids were submitted by the Friday evening deadline for this week’s auction. Michael Fay, of Avison Young, said hundreds of potential buyers had shown interest in the property, but none were ultimately prepared to match the strong initial bid of Hussain Sajwani, of DAMAC Properties. Avison Young is the commercial real estate firm that was appointed to market the land as part of a class-action lawsuit. The auction for the 1.8-acre parcel in Surfside was scheduled for Tuesday. Earlier this month, families of the victims reached a $997 million settlement with local officials, the developers of an adjacent building and others whom they hold responsible for the collapse of the 40-year-old, 12-story beachside building during the early hours of June 24. Most of the Champlain Towers South collapsed suddenly about 1:20 a.m. last June 24 as most of its residents slept. Only three people survived the initial collapse. No other survivors were found despite the around-the-clock efforts of rescuers who dug through a 40-foot pile of rubble for two weeks. Another three dozen people were in the portion of the building that remained standing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWatkinsville: Two Republican front-runners hoping to clinch primary majorities made their final pitches to voters Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s election. Gov. Brian Kemp and former football star Herschel Walker hope to win GOP nominations for governor and U.S. senator Tuesday without runoffs, with polls showing both men backed by more than 50% of voters. Kemp met voters at a rally in Watkinsville, near his home in Athens, with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts showing up to support him. Walker spoke to Republicans in Columbus, having moved into a more public campaign phase in recent days despite continued questions about his past. Walker has been accused of threatening his ex-wife’s life, exaggerating his business record and lying about graduating from the University of Georgia. An Associated Press story Saturday found that Walker was actually a paid spokesman for a for-profit veterans program that Walker has described as a way he helps veterans. Walker’s speech focused on his life story and general attacks on Democratic policies. “It is time that we get back to where we started,” Walker said, arguing that Democrats have strayed from American values. Other candidates making final pitches include former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, Kemp’s top rival for the Republican nomination, and state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and Navy veteran and former banker Latham Saddler, Walker’s rivals for the Senate seat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Board of Education has selected the former principal of Waipahu High School to be the next superintendent of the state’s public schools. The board voted 8-1 Thursday to select Keith Hayashi, who has been interim superintendent since August. At Waipahu High School, Hayashi pioneered the Early College program, which allows high school students to take college classes through a partnership with the University of Hawaii. College professors teach the classes on high school campuses for which students receive both high school and college credit. The program is now available at 36 high schools across the state. The board’s chairperson, Catherine Payne, said the board was looking for a candidate who could heal the school system, bring the community and stakeholders together, and transition schools out of the pandemic. “His work at Waipahu High School has really touched a lot of students who were struggling and helped them to move forward into successful lives,” Payne said. “So looking at how that might be able to be applied throughout our system is really important.” Hayashi’s appointment will take effect July 1. Payne said his salary and other contract details will be negotiated. The state Legislature has set a maximum salary of $250,000 a year for the job.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate in April dropped a tenth of a percent to 2.6% to mark a third consecutive month of historic lows since record-keeping started in 1976, state officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said 913,000 workers have jobs, while about 24,000 are looking for work, as Idaho’s red-hot economy continues. The state’s labor force of 937,000 in April represents a labor force participation rate of 62.1%, an increase of a tenth of a percent over the previous month. Idaho’s peak participation rate was 71.4% in September 1998. The labor force participation rate is calculated from those 16 years and older working or looking for work. The Labor Department said there are more than two jobs available for every unemployed Idaho resident looking for work. Idaho’s nonfarm jobs exceeded expectations with an increase of 3,000 jobs to 815,500 in April. Industry sectors showing the most gains include natural resources, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and private educational services. Those showing greatest job declines include arts, entertainment and recreation, and information. Idaho’s unemployment rate continues to run below the national unemployment rate, which was 3.6% in April.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An officer who shot and seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy who ran away after being pulled over while driving a stolen vehicle was relieved of his police powers Friday, officials said. “He’s still an active member of the Chicago Police Department,” police spokesman Don Terry told the Chicago Tribune about the officer, whose name hasn’t been released. “He’s not going to be patrolling the streets, and he won’t be able to arrest people.” The action means the officer will still get paid but will be assigned to “desk duty,” Terry said. The officer had already been placed on administrative duties while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates the shooting. Police Superintendent David Brown said Thursday that the fleeing teenager turned toward the officer during Wednesday’s encounter before the officer fired on him. No shots were fired at the officer, Brown said. The boy jumped from the car as officers approached the vehicle, which police said was stolen Monday and used in a carjacking Tuesday. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital, Brown said Thursday. He did not elaborate, and no charges have been announced. No weapon was found at the scene, COPA said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democrats and activists are holding out little hope of getting the votes needed to uphold the governor’s veto of a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in school sports. The Republican-dominated Legislature is slated to override the veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who said in March that the legislation doesn’t provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports.” But the bill passed by wide margins, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate pledged to override Holcomb’s veto with simple majorities. Although two Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted against the measure, Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis said the override will likely be successful when the Legislature reconvenes for one day Tuesday. “This bill was filed, I believe, with the intention to specifically go after transgender Hoosiers because it was a politically savvy thing to do for the Republican base,” Ford said Friday. Still, Ford said Democrats continue to have conversations with lawmakers across the aisle, noting that some Republicans might be inclined to change their votes following the primary and the governor’s veto.\n\nIowa\n\nBettendorf: Students are once again attending class in the 1873 Forest Grove School. After raising about $200,000 over seven years to restore the falling-down, one-room school, supporters have opened the building for free “reenactments” of a typical student day. A schoolmarm teaches subjects and skills as they might have been taught during the 1920s, the time period to which the school was restored. Iowa once had 12,000 to 14,000 one-room school houses, depending on the report consulted, but with either number, Iowa had more than any other state in the nation. Supporters of Forest Grove preservation efforts want Forest Grove to be used to interpret and teach the role these schools played in the state’s history, Sharon Andresen, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, told the Quad-City Times. Because of legislation requiring consolidation of schools, Iowa’s last one-room school closed in 1967; Forest Grove closed 10 years earlier in 1957. Half- or full-day reenactments are open to any public, private or homeschool classes in the Quad City area. Fourth grade is a good target level, but Diane Borcherding, a retired Bettendorf High School biology teacher who is volunteering her time as the schoolmarm, is open to other grades, depending on the circumstances.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Supreme Court on Friday disbarred former prosecutor Jacqie Spradling for her conduct during a double-murder trial in Topeka in 2012. The court said while Spradling was a prosecutor in Shawnee County, she engaged in “repeated patterns of misconduct” during the trial of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of killing her husband and his fiance. Chandler’s convictions were later overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. She is scheduled for a new trial later this year. The Supreme Court said Spradling ignored a court order, made arguments not supported by evidence, lied in her briefs and oral arguments, and made false statements during a disciplinary investigation. The Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys recommended in June 2021 that Spradling be disbarred for her “win at all costs” attitude in the Chandler case and in the 2017 conviction of Jacob Ewing, of Holton, on rape and sodomy charges. The state Supreme Court found Spradling did not violate ethical standards in Ewing’s case. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed Ewing’s conviction in 2018, but he later accepted a plea deal. Last year, Spradling resigned from her position as assistant county attorney in Allen County and as county attorney in Bourbon County.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Katy Perry earned her zookeeper stripes at the Louisville Zoo on Saturday. Zoo staff welcomed the pop music icon with an up-close encounter featuring the zoo’s own superstars, Simon, a black-footed penguin, and Sebastian the sloth. The “Roar” singer has been staying in Kentucky recently with her daughter, Daisy Dove, while fiancé Orlando Bloom shoots his new movie, “Red Right Hand.” Production on that film is expected to wrap up in June. At the zoo, Perry was “Walking on Air” through Wild Lights, a lantern festival featuring 50,000 LED lights. She also posed like a penguin next to Simon and admired the hang-ten skills of Sebastian the sloth, who “truly connected” with Perry, according to a post on the zoo sloths’ Twitter page. The Louisville Zoo features over 1,200 animals in exhibits with themes from all over the world, including Africa, home to Simon and other African penguins, as well as Australia and South America, where the sloths hang out. Earlier this month, Chelsea Handler hosted Perry on her podcast, “Dear Chelsea,” to chat about Perry’s stay in the Bluegrass State. “I’m like, living in Kentucky, and I have for almost a month now. And that’s quite an amazing experience because it reminds you that Hollywood is not America,” Perry said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has agreed to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of shots students are required to get to enroll in school, officials said. The state health department said in a news release Wednesday that it will continue to strongly recommend the vaccine, in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, but acknowledged that the vaccine had not yet received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for those under age 16. “While we strongly recommend all eligible children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now, if they have not already been so, we are making this decision to give families and schools the time they need to prepare accordingly,” the news release said. Because the vaccine is not fully approved for those age 15 and under, requiring it would have made little difference to most students in kindergarten through high school, Edwards noted during his monthly call-in radio show. State Sen. Fred Mills, R-New Iberia, announced on the Senate floor that the administration agreed to remove the requirement after meeting with legislators. Legislation that would have removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the requirement list had stalled earlier in the session.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A teacher whose LGBTQ lesson plan for kindergartners was removed from a state website said Friday that the governor and education department succumbed to outside pressure. The governor and department “caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people, families, and students in Maine,” Kailina Mills wrote in a social media post. The lesson plan was at the heart of a Republican attack ad that accused Democratic Gov. Janet Mills of spending $2.8 million to create “radical school lessons” aimed at kindergartners. On the video, the teacher discusses “Freedom Holidays” like the Fourth of July, Juneteenth and Women’s Equality Day before discussing freedoms won by the LGBTQ community, including same-sex marriage. She talks about sexual identities under the umbrella of “LGBT+” in the discussion. The governor previously said she agreed with the Department of Education’s review that concluded the lesson wasn’t age-appropriate. Kailina Mills disagreed with that assessment, citing a study that showed gender identities are solidified between ages 5 and 7. She wrote Friday that she’s taught preschoolers who are transgender and nonbinary and said that “those children and those families deserve to be represented in their school curriculum.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A western Maryland race track has evicted the remnants of a trucker protest that had used the site as a staging ground. The People’s Convoy had conducted a series of rolling protests around the Capital Beltway in March to protest pandemic restrictions and other grievances. After a hiatus, a smaller group of truckers returned Wednesday to the Hagerstown Speedway. But Speedway General Manager Lisa Plessinger asked the group to leave amid infighting over its next steps. The last of the truckers left Friday night, she said. She compared the convoy to “like when your mother-in-law comes to visit and decides to stay.” A press release issued Friday on a Facebook page for The People’s Convoy “declares victory and announces its conclusion of the national convoy portion of this great movement.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: More than 40 people – including marine mammal experts, interns and volunteers – spent several hours battling an incoming tide to help rescue seven dolphins that got stranded in the shallow waters of a Cape Cod river last week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare first got word that the Atlantic white-sided dolphins got stranded in a shallow gut of the Herring River in Wellfleet on Wednesday morning, and rescuers were on the scene in about an hour, the organization said in a statement. It’s not unusual for dolphins to get stranded in the area because of its shape as a hook within the larger hook of Cape Cod’s shoreline and because of large tidal fluctuations in Cape Cod Bay. “The dolphins appeared alert and in good health, but the day was sure to be sunny and warm, and we needed to move quickly,” said Misty Niemeyer, of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team. The tide was also coming in, and dolphins often risk getting stranded again when it rolls out, she said. The dolphins – all likely young males, 6 to 8 feet in length and weighing up to 250 pounds – were then taken in a vehicle custom-designed to transport dolphins and released in deeper waters off Provincetown in the early afternoon.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Nearly all of the power lost following a deadly tornado that killed two people and flattened parts of a northern Michigan community has been restored, state police said Sunday. Police also said everyone had been accounted for in Gaylord, where Friday afternoon’s EF3 twister also left more than 40 people injured. Authorities had said Saturday that they were not able to account for one person. Cleanup continued Sunday in the town of 4,200 people about 230 miles northwest of Detroit. About 6,100 utility customers in Otsego County, where Gaylord is the county seat, lost power due to Friday’s storms, according to Jackson-based Consumers Energy. State police said Sunday that electricity had been restored to 99% of utility customers in Gaylord. The tornado packed winds of 140 mph that tore roofs and walls from businesses and largely destroyed a mobile home park. Such storms are uncommon in northern Michigan. State police Lt. Derrick Carroll has said the city doesn’t have tornado sirens, though anyone with a mobile phone got a “code red” warning from the weather service about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The Nottingham Forest mobile home park was one of the first places hit by the tornado. Two residents, described by police as being in their 70s, were killed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: A partial skull that was discovered last summer by two kayakers will be returned to Native American officials after investigations determined it was about 8,000 years old. The kayakers found the skull in the drought-depleted Minnesota River about 110 miles west of Minneapolis, Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said. Thinking it might be related to a missing person case or murder, Hable turned the skull over to a medical examiner and eventually to the FBI, where a forensic anthropologist used carbon dating to determine it was likely the skull of a young man who lived between 5500 and 6000 B.C., Hable said. “It was a complete shock to us that that bone was that old,” Hable told Minnesota Public Radio. The anthropologist determined the man had a depression in his skull that was “perhaps suggestive of the cause of death.” After the sheriff posted about the discovery Wednesday, his office was criticized by several Native Americans, who said publishing photos of ancestral remains was offensive to their culture. Hable said his office removed the post. “We didn’t mean for it to be offensive whatsoever,” he said. Hable said the remains will be turned over to Upper Sioux Community tribal officials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Gilbert Mason Jr., who grew up in the civil rights movement and became a physician and a Black and civil rights historian, has died at age 68. Mason died Wednesday and funeral arrangements were not yet complete, according to Infinity Funeral Home in Biloxi. Mason was 5 years old in 1959 when he watched his father, Gilbert Mason Sr., lead Biloxi’s first wade-in to desegregate beaches, the Sun Herald reports. And his name was on the 1971 lawsuit that made Biloxi schools the state’s first to integrate. Like his father, Mason became a physician who served poor people. His practice was in the New Orleans area, but he returned to Biloxi when his father became ill. The elder Mason died in 2006. The son spent his last years documenting civil rights and Black history and his father’s accomplishments, the newspaper reports. Father and son both had photographic memories, said Clemon Jimerson Sr. He said the younger Mason’s memories helped to document the history of scouting on the Mississippi Coast, the music history of Biloxi and other areas for the Mississippi Blues Trail, the integration of Coast schools, and the preservation of Nichols Elementary, the historically Black school in East Biloxi.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: City officials have approved a new ordinance that clarifies when people may witness or record police officers’ actions without being arrested. The Kansas City Council on Thursday approved the ordinance to settle a federal lawsuit filed by three women who were arrested during racial injustice protests in 2020. The women were charged with violating city laws involving resisting or interfering with an officer. The lawsuit said those laws were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, KCUR reports. The ordinance approved Thursday says witnessing or recording police officers does not violate city law unless the offender is substantially impeding the officer’s duties. The women were among more than 200 nonviolent protesters arrested at or near the Country Club Plaza during protests after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The settlement did not require the city to pay any monetary damages.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A full month after a judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to undergo surgery before they could change their gender on their birth certificate, the state still isn’t in compliance with the court order, the ACLU of Montana said. Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the state health department, said the agency is still working with the Department of Justice to review the April 21 ruling and its implications. He did not respond to an email asking if that meant the state was evaluating whether to appeal the order. “We have continued to be patient in allowing the state time to comply with the court ordered preliminary injunction,” the ACLU of Montana said in a recent statement. “However, close to one month has passed and the State’s willful indifference to the court order is inexcusable.” Montana is among a growing list of Republican-controlled states that have moved to restrict transgender rights, including requiring student-athletes to participate in sports based on their gender assigned at birth or making it illegal for transgender minors to be treated with hormones or puberty blockers.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: A pilot died after a single-engine plane crashed at the Wayne Municipal Airport, officials said. The Cessna 140 crashed Friday evening during the MayDay STOL Drag Races. The organization that planned the events said in a Facebook post that the pilot crashed on final approach at the airport after apparently stalling and spinning. No one else was aboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The pilot’s name was not released. STOL, or short take-off and landing, drag racing involves pilots flying side-by-side 2,000 feet down and back up. The rest of the weekend’s planned events were canceled.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 emergency declarations for Nevada ended Friday as the public health agency for metro Las Vegas noted that the pandemic isn’t over and said it will continue to monitor spread of the coronavirus and provide assistance with vaccinating and testing. While most of the state’s pandemic measures, including business restrictions and mask mandates, have already been lifted, the Southern Nevada Health District said it was important to remind the public that the virus that causes COVID-19 continued to circulate. “Cases are currently increasing, and new variants are emerging,” said Dr. Fermin Leguen, chief medical officer for the district. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the state’s emergency Friday – a planned action he announced two weeks ago, saying he wanted to ensure that there would be no gap in services. “Today, we are turning the page on the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19 and are laser focused on ensuring our recovery from the public health, fiscal and economy crisis serves the needs of Nevada’s families,” Sisolak, a Democrat running for reelection, said Thursday in a statement. Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas area, on Thursday announced the end of of its emergency declaration, which was declared March 15, 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConway: A forest fire in northern New Hampshire that’s burned 106 acres is nearly contained, officials said Friday. The Bemis Fire in Crawford Notch State Park, the White Mountain National Forest, and on private land began May 13 in steep, rugged terrain. The cause is under investigation. “It’s important for the public to know that the Bemis Fire remains an active fire scene, and there are still firefighters and equipment on site,” said Capt. Adrian Reyes of the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau. “This weekend is expected to bring record temperatures to the region, and we ask that anyone wishing to spend time outdoors avoids the area of the fire, for their own safety as well as for the safety of the wildland crew,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear population appears to be increasing, based on the number of reported serious encounters with humans, but as New Jersey has had no official bear management plan for the past two years, the Division of Fish and Wildlife doesn’t know for sure. Without the plan, the division did not make an estimate of the bear population in the state’s northwest area last year and won’t do so this year. The last count was done in 2020 and coincided with the last statewide bear hunt. At that time there were about 3,158 bears in northwestern New Jersey, specifically in the areas previously designated as bear hunting zones north of Route 80 and west of Route 287. Records show that reported serious encounters with bears since the count have gone up nearly ninefold. “The DEP does not have a statewide population estimate, though sightings of black bears have been reported in all 21 counties,” said the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Division of Fish and Wildlife. At least two people in Sussex County were injured in separate black bear encounters just outside their homes, and at least three dogs were killed or injured. The 2020 count shows the bear population doubled from the 1,522 counted in 2018, the last year a bear hunt was allowed on state-owned lands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMora: As more than 2,700 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Sunday, many evacuees were growing concerned about their future after weeks away from home. The biggest fire in the state’s recorded history has been burning for six weeks now, and some of the hundreds forced to evacuate say their financial resources are dwindling. Amity Maes, a 30-year-old Mora resident who said she is 81/ 2 months pregnant and penniless, told the Santa Fe New Mexican she bounced around for weeks before finding shelter at an evacuation center in Glorieta, where she believes she contracted COVID-19. Officials at Glorieta Adventure Camps said there have been 67 coronavirus cases among evacuees, including some that required hospitalization. After her isolation period, Maes said she was urged to leave and go to a hotel in Santa Fe where she could be closer to a hospital if she went into labor. But the hotel didn’t have her reservation when she arrived, and when she finally got a room, it was only for one night. “They keep encouraging us to go to Albuquerque” where evacuees are being housed in hotels, Maes told the newspaper. “We don’t have gas. We don’t have no income. There’s no gas vouchers. There’s no anything. I’m on a quarter-tank of gas, and I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street inside the city’s sole Army base now bears the name of a Black Congressional Medal of Honor recipient rather than a Confederate general. Fort Hamilton changed the road’s name to John Warren Avenue on Friday morning, following a years-old push by local officials to remove Confederate symbols nationwide. The base had previously called the street General Lee Avenue, after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lt. John Warren, of Brooklyn, was killed at the age of 22 in 1969 in the Vietnam War when he fell in the direction of a grenade and shielded at least three men from the blast. His Congressional Medal of Honor citation says Williams’ “ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.” Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, and his Congressional Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to him in 1970. The base will also rename its Stonewall Jackson Drive, which is named after another Confederate general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Advocacy groups and voters who this year persuaded state courts to overturn the Legislature’s congressional redistricting plan asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to avoid hearing arguments on whether such courts must be curtailed in reviewing U.S. House maps. Attorneys representing the state also joined with outside lawyers to file four legal briefs with the justices urging them to reject a petition from Republican legislative leaders to take up the issue. Through their own private lawyers, the GOP lawmakers already asked the court to formally rule on whether a provision in the U.S. Constitution delegating to state legislatures the manner of holding U.S. House elections means that state judges can’t void congressional district lines created by the General Assembly. The authors of Friday’s filings say the Supreme Court already has ruled before that some decision-making on congressional redistricting can be delegated by a state’s citizens. The same holds true when the North Carolina Legislature passed laws two decades ago setting in place the authority of courts to review redistricting plans that they approved, the lawyers wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nPembina: One of the largest employers in northeastern North Dakota is closing later this year. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based New Flyer Industries is shutting down its charter and transit bus manufacturing plant in Pembina, located close to the Canadian border. Pembina Mayor Mike Fitzgerald said company was notified of the decision in a letter. The company told Fitzgerald that it was having difficulty finding qualified employees, a factor in its conversion to electric vehicles, and the plant’s location has become an issue. New Flyer has a plant in Crookston, Minnesota, which is about 100 miles from Pembina. Fitzgerald called the move “devastating” and said it will put more than 200 employees out of work, KFGO radio reports. The Pembina plant opened in 1963.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit pairing photographs from two moments of societal crisis – the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic – aims to help visitors see parallels between the human tolls felt across generations. The show, “Chronicles: The Great Depression and the Pandemic,” opened Saturday at the and runs through Aug. 28. It couples images of day-to-day life gathered by 10 Depression-era photographers and five contemporary Ohio photographers. The 1930s photographers – including Dorothea Lange, Esther Bubley, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Carl Mydans, Gordon Parks, John Vachon and Ben Shahn – were hired by the U.S. government Works Progress Administration’s Farm Security Administration. The Ohio photographers are Autumn Bland, Donald Black, Jr., Angelo Merendino, Jane Alden Stevens and Shane Wynn. Their pictures document the ravages of the coronavirus across different social and economic groups. Special events tied to the exhibit include a talk with co-curators Christine Fowler Shearer and Arnold Tunstall on Sunday, a history lecture on the WPA, an artist talk with Wynn, and classes on smartphone photography and enhancing Instagram accounts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With the state only days away from enacting the toughest ban on abortion in the U.S., questions remained Friday about enforcing the law’s limited exceptions. The law allows abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life “in a medical emergency,” and supporters said doctors still would decide what an emergency is, though that could change later if it becomes perceived as a loophole. There’s also an exception for cases of rape, sexual assault or incest that have been reported to law enforcement, but that doesn’t help victims who don’t report the crimes to police. Abortion providers said they are likely to be cautious because the new law, like a ban at about six weeks enacted earlier and a similar 2021 law in Texas, will expose them to potentially expensive lawsuits over alleged violations. They’re planning to refer some patients to states like Colorado or Kansas, but some won’t be able to manage the extra time or travel involved. Oklahoma will provide a preview of what is in store for other states if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through on a draft opinion leaked earlier this month overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The law also is likely to prompt Oklahoma residents – and Texans who’d traveled to the neighboring state – to go elsewhere to end their pregnancies.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A Democratic state lawmaker is calling for an investigation into a ballot-printing fiasco that will delay results from Tuesday’s primary by weeks, with a key U.S. House race hanging in the balance in a state that prides itself on voter access and election transparency. Tens of thousands of ballots in the state’s third-largest county were printed with blurred barcodes, making them unreadable by vote-counting machines – a mistake that wasn’t caught until ballots were already being returned in the vote-by-mail state. Elections workers must now hand-transfer the votes from those ballots to new ones that can be read in a painstaking process that also raises the possibility of duplication errors. As the scope of the crisis became apparent, local, state and federal lawmakers Friday all escalated their criticism of Clackamas County Elections Clerk Sherry Hall, who defended her actions at a news conference Friday and said she had learned from the mistakes. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who represents voters in the county, called the situation “unreasonable, and untenable,” and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents some Clackamas voters in Congress, called Hall’s slow reaction “unconscionable.” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan demanded a written plan from Hall detailing how she would get results tabulated by June 13, the state deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Summer Lee has won a five-way Democratic primary for a Pittsburgh-based U.S. House seat, making her the favorite in the heavily Democratic district to win the fall general election and become the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Friday was the fourth day of counting ballots after Tuesday’s primary in the closely contested race for the open 12th District seat. Lee, a second-term state House member, lawyer and former labor organizer, comes from the party’s progressive wing. She was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two-time presidential candidate and a leading voice in the Democratic Party’s left wing who came to campaign for Lee. Lee beat out second-place Steve Irwin, who was endorsed by the Allegheny County Democratic Party and backed by prominent Democrats from the county. The seat is open because longtime Rep. Mike Doyle – first elected in 1994 – is not running again. It also has new boundaries since Pennsylvania’s congressional districts were redrawn to account for a decade of demographic changes identified by the 2020 census. Lee will face the Republican nominee of the same name as the outgoing Democratic incumbent – Mike Doyle – in the fall general election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Dr. Anthony Fauci urged graduates of Roger Williams University on Friday to fight what he called the “normalization of untruths,” which has become a growing and more troubling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the face of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus, was the commencement ceremony’s keynote speaker but addressed students at the private Rhode Island college remotely because he had to attend a memorial service for a family member. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have experienced firsthand something that has troubled and saddened me – a deepened divisiveness in our nation,” he said. “Unfortunately, differences of opinion or ideology are propped up by deliberate distortions of reality to the point of fabrications, conspiracy theories, and outright lies.” He told the students to apply the analytic skills they have learned during their time at the university to challenge and renounce untruths, which he called a threat to the nation. “Reject the politicization of science that denigrates evidence and facts,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two new state laws require elementary school teachers to get a 30-minute break each day without students and ban districts from turning over school lunch debt to collection agencies. The bills were passed in the final days of the 2022 General Assembly session and signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster. Both passed the House and Senate unanimously. The break bill requires teachers in elementary school and special education teachers who have students in their classes for most of the day to get 30 minutes without any assigned duties or responsibilities. Teacher groups requested the law, saying some teachers never had time to eat a lunch or even use the bathroom because they were watching students. A second bill prohibits school districts from turning over debt a student owes for school lunches to a collection agency. Supporters said students need to eat regardless of their ability to pay, and turning debt over to a collection agency was too drastic of a step.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled a sex crime conviction doesn’t require an actual victim. The court last week upheld the conviction of a man stemming from a sting operation during the 2017 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Carlocito Slim argued he was just looking for a massage when he responded to an ad on the Backpage website under the headline “Women Seeking Men.” Slim was actually responding to an ad that was a sting setup and unknowingly texted a special agent with South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation. The agent, posing as a pimp, told Slim he could meet a 15-year-old girl. And when Slim showed up at the assigned meeting place with condoms and $200, he was arrested and later convicted of two federal felonies. Slim argued there couldn’t be a conviction because there was no pimp and no crime victim. Defense attorney Terry Pechota told the judges his client simply didn’t understand the text communications and was only looking for a massage, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “He doesn’t ask about whether or not the girl is 16, or whether they’re going to engage in any funny stuff or illegal stuff,” Pechota said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman said Slim knew what was going on and later told investigators he thought he was meeting a girl for sex.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Friday that he doesn’t have a timeline yet on when his administration might roll out a long-blocked school voucher program that saw its biggest legal roadblock removed by the state’s high court last week. The Republican told reporters it was a “good first step” for the Supreme Court to rule Wednesday that the voucher initiative doesn’t violate the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. The decision upends earlier court rulings that have kept the program that passed in 2019 from ever being implemented. The program applies only to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The two counties were among the entities that sued over the program. But the governor also said there are “legal decisions yet to be made” and “a lot of steps that have to come to fruition” before the program can get up and running. “Once we determine the speed with which the court will make its final decisions, then we can move forward with the particulars to make sure this works and fits, and how it is that we roll it out,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMentone: The top elected official in a rural, sparsely populated West Texas county has been arrested after being accused of stealing cattle. Loving County Judge Skeet Jones, 71, and three other men were arrested Friday on charges of livestock theft and engaging in organized criminal activity. All four men were taken to the jail in neighboring Winkler County, where they have since been released on bond. Jones hadn’t returned a call seeking comment Sunday. The arrests came after a yearlong investigation, according to a statement from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. The association has commissioned peace officers known as special rangers who investigate agricultural crimes, including the theft of cattle and horses. The rangers also determine the ownership of stray livestock. The association’s special rangers allege Jones and the others gathered stray cattle and sold them without following procedures set forth in the Texas Agriculture Code. Those procedures include calling the sheriff to report stray livestock and allowing the sheriff to search for the animal’s owner. The association declined to provide additional details about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. The theft of livestock charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the organized criminal activity charge up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southern Utah’s first 24-hour child care center is opening soon, aiming to help families break away from poverty. The new Stepping Stones day care center is slated to open June 1 and will be housed under SwitchPoint, the St. George-based nonprofit that runs and operates the area’s largest homeless shelter, food bank and other programs aimed at helping people living in poverty. The center will stay open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and will aim to help parents and guardians who struggle who pay the costs of child care elsewhere. “We’ve got to create something that can help alleviate keeping families trapped in poverty,” said Carol Holloway, the executive director of Switchpoint, to a packed room of people at a ribbon-cutting event at the center Tuesday. Kamie Blake, the program director for the care center, said it will be the only 24/7 child care center in southern Utah and one of the few in operation in the state. Children as young as 6 weeks old and up to 12 years old will be eligible to attend. At full capacity, Stepping Stones can take up to 270 kids each day and has a kitchen, laundry and sleeping areas to accommodate the round-the-clock operations. There are five classrooms on site, with lessons scheduled based on age.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have created a drug use standards advisory board within the state sentencing commission, saying it “places no limits on which drugs can be contemplated for legalization or the amounts.” The board would determine “the benchmark personal use dosage and the benchmark personal use supply” for regulated and unregulated drugs, with a goal of preventing and reducing the criminalization of personal drug use, according to the bill. Scott, a Republican, said in his letter Thursday to the General Assembly the bill includes “absolutely no recognition” of health and safety impacts of using fentanyl, heroin and other drugs, and it doesn’t acknowledge law enforcement’s role in stopping dealers. Scott also vetoed a bill that would have expanded eligibility for the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent crimes. “Ultimately, I find this bill inconsistent with the State’s responsibilities to keep the public safe,” he wrote. Rep. Selene Colburn, P-Burlington, who supported both bills, said she was upset about the outcome, WCAX-TV reports. “We are not talking about reducing penalties for violent crimes or changing expungement eligibility. We are simply talking about treating people who have used drugs and who have struggled with substance use disorder with dignity and respect and the basic belief that their lives are valuable,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Attorneys for the U.S. government have indicated they will not oppose a plan to lift all remaining restrictions next month on John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington ruled last year that Hinckley can be freed unconditionally in June if he continues to follow the rules placed on him and remains mentally stable as he continues to live in Williamsburg. Hinckley, 66, has indeed remained mentally stable and violated no conditions, according to a letter filed by U.S. attorneys with the court Thursday. That determination was based on letters from the Washington’s Department of Health, which has overseen Hinckley’s care. A court hearing is scheduled for June 1. Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis, when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president and injured three others. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time, after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. She died in July. He signed a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the area last year and began living there with his cat, Theo, according to court filings. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that he’s found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. He’s also shared his music on YouTube.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An invasive European green crab was captured last week in Hood Canal, the farthest south the species has been found in the Salish Sea. Volunteers with Washington Sea Grant trapped the male European green crab in Nick’s Lagoon near Seabeck in Kitsap County, The Seattle Times reports. The organization has been tasked by the state with early detection of the crab’s spread. Washington Sea Grant marine ecologist Emily Grason said in a news release the crab arrived at the lagoon last year, based on its size. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in response will increase trapping there to assess the scope of the green crab presence and try to locally eradicate the species. Gov. Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation in January to address a significant increase in European green crab populations within the Lummi Nation’s sea pond near Bellingham. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age. It also out-competes native crab species and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems. It was first found in Washington’s inland waters in 2016.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that social services workers will receive a 15% pay increase by tapping funds from existing vacant positions after such efforts failed in the Legislature. About 970 employees of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Social Services will receive the raises starting June 18. There are more than 6,500 children in the care of the state. According to the DHHR, there is a 30% vacancy rate statewide for foster care employees. “I told you we’d get this done, and we got it done without spending any excess money,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “I always say we need to mind the store, and we’ve done it the right way. As a result, we’re now able to compensate these people that are doing incredible work.” Employee pay raises and other key provisions were stripped from a social services bill before it died on the final day of the regular legislative session in March. After the pay raises were gutted, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch told a Senate committee that the department would reduce the number of open positions to provide the much-needed raises to child protective services employees. Crouch said Thursday those vacant positions indeed funded the raises.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A disorderly conduct conviction can’t disqualify someone from obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a unanimous decision that could dramatically broaden who can carry hidden firearms, knives and stun guns. The court found that disorderly conduct isn’t a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law and therefore doesn’t disqualify a person from holding a concealed carry license. Justice Jill Karofsky, a member of the court’s liberal minority, concurred but in a separate opinion called on legislators to close a “dangerous loophole” that will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons. Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill a year ago that would have reconciled the language, but it never got got a hearing. “Though legally correct, this result is as nonsensical as it is dangerous,” Karofsky wrote. “When a domestic abuse perpetrator, who has engaged in threats to kill or any other type of domestic violence, has access to a gun, the lethality risk for his victim increases significantly.” The case revolves around Daniel Doubek, of Green Bay. According to court documents, Doubek broke into his estranged wife’s trailer in Door County in 1993 waving a board and shouting threats. He was ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local reservoirs are likely to be nearly drained this summer amid lingering drought in the Snake River basin, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Federal officials predicted Thursday during an annual water meeting at the Teton County Library that reservoirs like Jackson Lake and Palisades could fall to 2%-10% if summer proves particularly hot and dry, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2014/05/09/hot-new-romance-novels-may-2014-julie-james/8867305/", "title": "Lots and lots of new romances to read this weekend", "text": "Joyce Lamb\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nCurl up with some awesome romances this weekend, though you'll probably hope there were more like 28,000 hours in a day!

Mindful of her childhood agreement that she'd take Judy's place if she needed her to, Deirdre and her cat Looney reluctantly set off for the conference, planning to sign a few books, shake a few hands and then go back home to Seattle. She didn't plan on meeting cover model Red Currier and falling head over heels in love. And it doesn't help her happily-ever-after that she's masquerading as her married, three-months-pregnant sister.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2019/11/11/veterans-day-meals-2019-free-food-and-deals-freebies-discounts-observed-holiday-nov-11/2528129001/", "title": "Veterans Day deals: Free food and deals on November 11", "text": "Active military and veterans have sacrificed so much for freedom in America.

With the use of AI, users can ask Meta questions regarding weather, restaurants, culture or more.\n\nA video trailer shared by the two companies shows that users can ask \"Hey Meta, how strong is the wind today?\" or say \"Hey Meta, take a video\" to get immediate assistance.\n\n\"Together with Meta, we are setting new bounds of reality,\" Oakley Global President Caio Amato said in a news release. \"It is not only about pushing forward performance, but also about amplifying human potential as never before.

But the feature, which debuted at last year's WWDC, had a hinted return appearance coming later this year.\n\nStill, Apple Intelligence had a major part to play, with AI shown to power a new live translation feature that automatically translates messages, generates translated captions on Facetime and audio translations on phone calls. Visual intelligence upgrades coming to the new operating system, dubbed iOS 26, were shown using ChatGPT to learn about on-screen objects, whether to buy or gain knowledge.\n\nHere's what was announced at Apple's WWDC keynote, which included an address from CEO Tim Cook.\n\niOS 26 release date\n\niOS 26 will be released for testing June 9 through the Apple Developer Program and a public beta version will be released through the Apple Beta Software Program next month, CEO Tim Cook said at the close of the keynote presentation.\n\nThe operating system will be available as an update for iPhone 11 and later \"this fall,\" he said.\n\nApple stresses AI progress\n\nSoftware boss Craig Federighi cited examples of new features such as Live Translation and Visual Intelligence as advances Apple was making with its Apple Intelligence. “Our platforms are more powerful and more useful than ever. We’re continuing to integrate Apple Intelligence across our ecosystem with so many new features that are right where you need them in the apps you use every day.\n\nCook added, \"We continue to advance each of our platforms with more ways to harness the power of Apple Intelligence, as well as a beautiful new design, our product experiences become even more seamless and enjoyable.\"\n\nApple shares dip during WWDC\n\nApple stock fell more than 1% as the WWDC event played out. Shares opened Monday, June 9, at $204.39, but fell to below $202 during the event.\n\nThe company stock price hit $259 in late December 2024, near the end of a three-month period in which Apple set an all-time record for iPhone upgrades. But shares dipped to $172 in April 2025 a few weeks after the company announced it was delaying some artificial intelligence upgrades to Siri to 2026.\n\nChanges to iPad windowing system\n\nApple showed off its iPad \"windowing\" system in iPadOS 26, which mimics a computer more than an iPhone. Users can open and arrange multiple apps at once using customizable sizing options.\n\nThe next MacOS: Tahoe\n\nThe upcoming MacOS will be called Tahoe, with a new design incorporating Liquid Glass so the dock and widgets look more refined. Your display will look larger and there are more ways to customize and personalize your Mac to match your style, Federighi said. Nice touches include adding emojis to folders, for instance.\n\nNew Apple TV+ looks\n\nOn-screen menu options you'll see while watching Apple TV+ productions are getting a makeover in the style of Liquid Glass, while the titles of TV shows and movie options on the home page are getting a bolder look as well.\n\nVisual Intelligence, with an assist from ChatGPT\n\nVisual Intelligence will be part of iOS 26 and let users explore their surroundings without changing apps. You use your camera “to learn about the objects and places around you,” Federighi said.\n\nIt will also let you use any app to learn more about what you are seeing. For instance, say you have a social media app up and see an instrument, you can screenshot that and ask ChatGPT “which rock songs is this instrument featured in,” and it lists songs for you, as demonstrated by the Apple design team’s Billy Sorrentino.\n\nAlso, if you see a piece of clothing or a lamp that interests you, with a screenshot an option will pop up to search for similar items in other apps such as Etsy. Visual Intelligence will also let you add an event you see in another app directly to your calendar.\n\nSpam detection in Messages\n\nOther iPhone updates include polls in Messages, while Spam Detection will slot unknown message senders into a separate queue until you approve them.\n\nPhone feature to catch when you're on hold\n\nThe upcoming iOS 26 will have a new unified phone layout that combines Favorites, Recents and Voicemails, so you don’t have to switch views. AI will create voicemail summaries. “This new intuitive layout makes it easier to navigate the app,” said Darin Adler, vice president of internet technologies.\n\nA Call Screening feature will answer unknown callers in the background and once they leave a voicemail is left you can pick up or ignore the message.\n\nAnother new feature, Hold Assist will “keep your spot in line while you wait for a live agent,” Adler said. Hold Assist automatically detects hold music and lets you tap hold and you can keep using your iPhone. Hold Assist will ring back to you when to return to the call.\n\niOS 26 it is. And it has Liquid Glass.\n\nThe new iPhone software will be called iOS 26, Federighi says. That comes after Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of human interface design, showed how the new operating systems will have an interface featuring “Liquid Glass,” which is translucent like glass but with a fluidity. Liquid Glass “brings more clarity to navigation and controls,” he said.\n\nUsing the camera, you swipe and tap to make the menu options appear using the new Liquid Glass interface, Federighi said. When using Safari, you get a larger screen with the dynamic controls hidden until you tap.\n\n'F1' promo kicks off Apple WWDC\n\nThe event begins with video showing Apple CEO Tim Cook talking with Federighi who is driving an F1 car around the top of Apple Park, a nod to the new Apple TV+ film, “F1,” starring Brad Pitt, hitting theaters June 27. “So glad they put CarPlay in this beast,” Federighi says, and blasts the song “Round and Round,” by by rock band Ratt.\n\nYou can watch the WWDC keynote beginning at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT. on Apple TV, on apple.com and on the Apple YouTube page.\n\nWhat is Apple's WWDC? What does WWDC stand for?\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference, held June 9-13, is the tech giant's annual showcase of its upcoming software updates. That means new features coming to iPhones, iPads, Mac computers and other devices.\n\nWho will be speaking?\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook typically delivers the keynote. Software boss Craig Federighi will likely also take the stage.\n\nWhat did Apple unveil at its last event?\n\nDuring Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 10, 2024, the company revealed features in iOS 18 and other operating systems including iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence and a smarter Siri virtual assistant.\n\nIs an iPhone expected to be revealed at WWDC?\n\nNo. Usually iPhones and devices such as iPads typically are debuted at Apple's September event. Last year, the company unveiled iPhone 16 models, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4.\n\nApple WWDC preview: What to expect at the event\n\nApple is expected to demonstrate new operating systems for iPhone, iPad and other devices including Mac computers, Apple Watch and Apple TV. What would be iOS 19 is expected to become iOS 26 – with a numerical name change similar to how car models are based on years, several outlets including Bloomberg and MacRumors have reported, citing unnamed persons familiar with Apple's plans.\n\nAlso, there may not be a big artificial intelligence splash. At last year's WWDC, Apple introduced a more \"personal\" and smarter Siri virtual assistant, which used Apple Intelligence, but many of the planned improvements have been delayed until 2026.\n\nHowever, Apple is expected to announce that third-party developers will be able to begin using the same AI foundation models the company uses for its Apple Intelligence platform, a move allowing developers to create new applications for Apple devices, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported.\n\nWhat’s being rumored to be revealed at WWDC?\n\nAmong the features Apple is expected to unfold at the event is an AI-powered iPhone battery management mode, which will monitor how you use your phone to conserve energy, Bloomberg has reported. Also possibly to be shown: a new game center app, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWhat is iOS 26?\n\niOS 26 will be the next operating system for the iPhone, according to multiple reports. Other operating systems for Apple devices include MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, tvOS, visionOS. The MacOs is expected to named \"Tahoe,\" the latest in a long line of names based on California locales, Bloomberg's Gurman reported.\n\nThe operating systems will have a new look in addition to new naming scheme. The new interfaces will use light and transparency, Bloomberg reported, styled similarly to the visionOS used on the Vision Pro headset, unveiled at the WWDC two years ago. App icons, tool bars and tab bars are set to look different in the update.\n\nWith the \"26 update,\" Apple is \"changing the playbook. They're not just going (to) iOS 19,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told USA TODAY. \"I think this is also a much bigger OS update, because it all sets up for iPhone 17 and the true AI strategy coming to Cupertino.\n\nApple Intelligence: What to expect\n\nApple may not reveal a truly Apple-Intelligent Siri – allowing the digital assistant to handle tasks across various apps via voice commands – but the company will show off new Apple Intelligence-driven features through its operating systems, Ives said. He expects more information on the company's AI plans including Gemini and ChatGPT integration with Siri and other apps.\n\n\"It's really going to unleash developers to take Apple into this next generation,\" Ives said. \"They need to build iOS that you could have true AI apps deployed in the ecosystem. Remember 25% of the world is going to access an AI through an Apple device over the coming years. ... They're going to have to make sure they're a key player in AI with the other big tech players in this Game of Thrones battle.\"\n\nObservers will want to see progress. \"Patience might be the word of the day, or even the year for Apple. People are talking about this as an AI gap year for Apple,” Alex Kantrowitz, founder of Big Technology podcast and newsletter, said on CNBC on Monday, June 9. \"They had the big vision announcement last year. Not a lot of progress this year as they tried to build it. It is hard to build.”\n\nApple WWDC keynote\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is underway.

You’ve got a summary in your hands right here.\n\nWith wireless wearables, voice-controlled smart home gadgets, giant TVs, handheld projectors, autonomous cars and passenger drones on display, more than 140,000 attendees roamed nearly 2.5 million square feet of showroom floor space to play around with tomorrow’s technology today.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence was one of the pervasive themes this year.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nFor our USA TODAY awards package, we wanted to find extraordinary products across several categories. Many of our picks were based on hands-on demos, even if they were prototypes. In other instances, we weren’t able to test them (like a flying car or multipurpose yard robot), but conceptually they proved super-innovative and unique, and something we could see ourselves using in the future.\n\nThe following is a look at USA TODAY's 50 top picks from CES 2025.\n\nHome theater\n\nLG SIGNATURE OLED T\n\nWhile we got a sneak peak of this TV last year, LG Electronics officially unveiled its 77-inch LG SIGNATURE OLED T − the world’s first transparent and true wireless 4K OLED TV – and announced a ship date of December 2024. When turned off, the television blends into your room decor, but when turned on you can choose from opaque (like your current TV) or animated images, such as fish in a virtual fish tank. Because it's wireless, components (like a cable box or video game system) can be connected to the Zero Connect Box somewhere else in the room.\n\nMore from CES: The LG StanbyMe 2 is the must-have smart TV from CES 2025\n\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\n\nThough Samsung’s “stretchable” TV concept wowed crowds at CES, it probably won’t see the light of day. Instead, the Samsung QN990F and QN900F are “ultra-premium” 8K TVs (7680 × 4320 pixels) that include Samsung’s comprehensive “Vision AI” family of features, including smart upscaling – to take content presented in HD or 4K and deliver a near 8K-quality picture. Ideal for night or dark environments, these Neo QLED televisions also support Samsung’s Wireless One Connect Box, which can transmit up to 8K resolution (up to 120Hz refresh rate) and audio, wirelessly up to 33 feet away − even with obstacles in its path. Other features include Wi-Fi 7 for super-fast Tizen OS-powered Smart TV access and support for the Samsung Art Store to turn your TV − when not watching TV shows, movies or sports – into a gallery-like experience in your home (now with works of art from The MoMA, Musée d'Orsay, The Met and more).\n\nThe Valerion VisionMaster Max\n\nAfter raising nearly $11 million on Kickstarter – making it the most funded project of 2024 – startup Valerion unveiled its flagship projector, VisionMaster Max, at CES 2025. Delivering a cinematic experience through advanced RGB laser technology and precision-engineered lens systems, this buzzworthy 4K projector offers a bright 3,000 ISO lumens picture, high 15,000:1 contrast ratio (for deep blacks), and supporting HDR10+, Dolby Vision and IMAX-enhanced certification. Dubbed a “home theater in a box,” VisionMaster Max is capable of producing an image up to 300 inches.\n\nAurzen ZIP\n\nIf it’s a portable projector you’re after, ZIP from Aurzen is the world's first tri-fold portable projector. When folded, it looks like a clamshell flip phone about an inch high, but once the Z-shaped device is opened and propped on a surface, it projects a 720p high-definition and autofocused image onto a wall or ceiling, with 100 lumens of brightness, via its dual-hinge gimbal with 180-degree flexibility. Whether it’s presentations in the boardroom or movies in the bedroom, project content from your phone (without needing Wi-Fi) or use the wireless HDMI dongle that plugs into a content source. Touch controls on the top let you turn on and tweak the picture. Integrated stereo speakers can simulate surround sound. Battery life tops 1½ hours between charges.\n\nLaptop and computing\n\nASUS Zenbook A14\n\nThere’s a lot to love about the ASUS Zenbook A14, starting with its unbelievably long battery life of up to 32 hours between charges. Yes, you read that correctly. It’s also billed as the lightest 14-inch Copilot+ PC laptop in the world at under 900 grams, thanks in part to its Ceraluminum material − fusing ceramics with aerospace-grade aluminum − that’s 30% lighter and three times stronger than traditional anodized aluminum. A phone link feature allows you to manage calls, notifications and file transfers − directly from the laptop. Starting at $899, the Zenbook A14 arrives in February.\n\nHP OmniStudio X\n\nDesigned for stationary content creators, HP’s first next-gen AI all-in-one PC packs several tools to help creative professionals – thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 200V series processor with up to 47 TOPS NPU (neuroprocessing unit) that’s estimated to be as much as 244% faster response times when editing photos and videos. Plus, HP AI Companion uses generative AI to aid users, and the 5-megapixel infrared camera, with adaptive audio, boosts virtual meetings.\n\nAcer Aspire Vero 16\n\nCare about the environment and need a laptop this spring? Coming in April, the Aspire Vero 16 (AV16-71P) is an example of Acer’s commitment to carbon neutrality, featuring a chassis made with more than 70% post-consumer recycled plastic and bio-based oyster shells – yes, made in part from oysters! – and with durability that meets MIL-STD-810H certification. A CES 2025 Innovation Award Honoree, the “green but mean” 16-inch laptop has an Intel Core Ultra processor (Series 2), up to 32GB of memory, and up to 2 terabytes of storage.\n\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable\n\nOK, so it’s only a concept to show what’s possible, but Lenovo showed off its ambitious ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable PC, a dual-screen laptop that extends the screen upward rather than folding it (or, fold two screens together, which is what other PC makers have done). Countless applications come to mind for being able to extend a screen a few inches with the simple press of a button, be it for productivity, creativity or entertainment.\n\nPhones & tablets\n\nOnePlus 13\n\nThough CES isn’t as much of a phone show compared with Mobile World Congress (MWC) in March, OnePlus launched its new flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13, powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the Android-based OxygenOS 15 platform (with AI enhancements), and a new camera layout. (Actually, the cameras are extraordinary.) One of the colors, Midnight Ocean, is the first phone to feature micro-fiber vegan leather, for a more luxurious feel, while the Arctic Dawn model introduces the first-ever surface-based glass coating. That, and OnePlus 13 is the first phone with both the IP68 and IP69 rating, for extra water and dust protection.\n\nGarmin inReach Messenger Plus\n\nThough the latest iPhone and Samsung smartphones support satellite connectivity for when you’re off the grid, it’s for emergency purposes only; plus, there are limitations on how to message contacts or SOS services. Winner of a “2025 Best of Innovation in Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps,” Garmin’s inReach Messenger Plus satellite communicator is a small device that wireless connects to your smartphone for group chats, sharing images or voice recordings with friends and family (such as wanting to show the view from a remote cabin in the woods). It works in conjunction with the Garmin Messenger companion app for smartphones. The battery last weeks and can charge up a phone, too.\n\nTCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus\n\niPads are great – for the indoors. If you want to read an e-book by the pool or watch a midday movie on a backyard deck, it’s virtually impossible to see the screen. Instead, TCL showed off its next-gen NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet, a super-thin 11.5-inch Android slate with TCL’s NXTPAPER 4.0 display, an anti-glare matte screen that still yields great color, brightness and sharpness in any environment. With the press of a button long the side of the tablet, NXTPAPER 11 Plus goes into a greyscale e-ink mode for reading e-books. Love it. Due out the “first half of 2025,” the device will also support Google’s “Circle to Search” feature for quickly looking up info, and the “Smart Voice Memo function” can transcribe and summarize recordings.\n\nSmart home and home tech\n\nGovee Gaming Pixel Light\n\nIt’s like Lite-Brite for the 21st century. The Govee Gaming Pixel Light is a panel that displays pixel art, including built-in videogame-related content – plus it’s the first that supports “text-to-light” AI-generated lighting effects, allowing you to type what you want on the Govee app and it’ll appear on the board. Upload animated gifs or images, or for more of retro feel, it’s also a speaker that plays 8-bit music with your pixel art. Ideal for mounting to a wall or sitting on a tabletop, you can also choose to display more practical info like time, real-time weather updates, sports schedules or stock quotes.\n\nTP-Link Tapo DL110\n\nDespite its minimalist design, there’s a lot going on under the hood of the TP-Link Tapo DL110 Smart Wi-Fi Door Lock, including six ways to unlock the door: by fingerprint, keypad, Tapo app on a smartphone, Bluetooth, Smart Assistant, or with included backup keys. The companion app also lets you remotely manage the weatherproof lock, monitor entry logs, and create temporary codes for guests to gain access to your home, such as a babysitter, cleaning person, dog walker or technician.\n\neufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1\n\nThe eufy brand may be best known for its security cameras, but its versatile vacuum sucked up some praise at CES. Winner of a 2025 Best of Innovation award, the aptly named eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 (model no. E20) is the world’s first detachable combo robot vacuum, meaning it can autonomously clean your home or can become a cordless stick vac or handheld vacuum for when you want to take control. Other features include a five-stage filtration system, large-capacity dust cup, and auto-empty station that can hold up to 75 days of dirt, dust and pet hair (before emptying).\n\nRoborock Saros Z70\n\nThough there were many impressive robo-vacs the CES 2025 – including Narwal’s Freo Z Ultra that cleverly maneuvers around obstacles (even charging cables or shoelaces as thin as 5 millimeters) – it’s hard not to be blown away by the first robotic vacuum and mop hybrid with a retractable arm that extends out of the top when needed. If the Saros Z70’s AI-powered camera detects an object in its path, like an errant sock or tissue lying in the middle of the room, it can extend a small robotic arm, pick it up and drive it over to where it should be (like a hamper for the sock or a waste basket for the tissue). Wow.\n\nKirin Electric Salt Spoon\n\nWeird, yes. A little big? Sure. But does it work? You bet. Instead of consuming flavorless food because it’s low in sodium, journalists at CES tried out Kirin’s “smart spoon,” which sends an electric current through the utensil to your tongue, which tricks your tastebuds into thinking your food is saltier than it is. The handle of the spoon houses the product’s power and settings, such as four different saltiness options. The idea is that we’d ingest salt for a healthier diet, but don’t expect this Japanese product to arrive in the U.S. any time soon.\n\nCameras (indoor/outdoor) and doorbells\n\nReolink Duo 3\n\nThough there were many camera systems on display at CES, the Reolink Duo 3 Wi-Fi features ultra-sharp 16-megapixel resolution and a dual-band (Wi-Fi 6) wireless connection. Winner of an IDA Design Award Honorable Mention, these cameras offer an ultra-wide 180-degree field of view, motion tracking (with time stamp), night vision, two-way audio, and up to 512GB of storage. Reolink also bowed the Argus 4 Pro, a 4K 180-degree color night vision battery camera, and Altas PT Ultra, a 4K continuous recording battery camera.\n\nRing + Kidde\n\nLeading home fire safety brand Kidde has joined forces with one of the biggest home security camera companies, Ring, to announce a 2025 collection of Smart Smoke and Combination Alarms (Smoke + CO). Essentially, the Kidde detectors/alarms will have integrated Ring technology, so users can receive real-time smoke and CO alerts through the Ring app and opt into professional monitoring and emergency dispatch service through a new Ring 24/7 Smoke & CO Monitoring subscription (about $5 a month). These new, collaborative solutions were showcased at CES 2025.\n\nRobots\n\nXoMotion\n\nBilled as the world’s most advanced wearable robotic exoskeleton, XoMotion from Vancouver, Canada’s Human In Motion Robotics Inc. is designed to assist patients with mobility impairments from spinal cord injuries, stroke and other neurological conditions. This lower-limb medical device helps with standing and walking through self-balancing and hands-free functionality, and it can be used in rehab centers and hospitals to lighten the cognitive load and physical strain on therapists. XoMotion recently received Health Canada approval for sales in Canada and is in clinical trials for FDA approval in the United States.\n\nYarbo\n\nAs seen at ShowStopers at CES 2025, Yarbo was designed to be the first multi-purpose yard robot to autonomously handle more than 20 kinds of demands, including lawn mowing, snow blowing, leaf blowing, tree and bush trimming, liquid spraying and more. Along with the core ‘bot, you’ll choose add-ons based on the task you need help with. The year-round modular machine features patented precise position and navigation, smart obstacle avoidance, a wireless charging mat, route planning tech, and support for app and remote control. Yarbo also can be programed in various modes like Patrol, Tow, Follow Me and more.\n\nFashion tech\n\nAura by Chamelo\n\nThe world’s first color-adjustable eyeglasses made its debut at CES 2025 with the Aura Prismatic Collection by aptly named Chamelo (as in “chameleon”). It features patented color-changing lenses; users simply touch the temple arm to change between “vibrant hues” – like blue, purple, red or gray – based on your outfit or mood. Chamelo is a 2025 Honoree in Fashion Tech.\n\nAudio\n\nJBL Tour ONE M3\n\nAlong with support for Hi-Res Bluetooth, Lossless Audio and True Adaptive Noise Cancelling 2.0 technology (via eight microphones), JBL’s latest over-ear headphones are the first to include JBL SMART Tx, a small wireless audio transmitter that lets users hear audio from virtually any USB-C or analog audio source, such as an inflight entertainment system, PC, tablet or TV. This includes full control over the wireless audio, like call management, EQ settings and support for Auracast, a Bluetooth feature that allows audio to be broadcast from one device to many others without the need for pairing. The JBL Tour ONE M3 launches in April.\n\nWatches and wearables\n\nApollon by Sky Labs\n\nNamed an honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category at the CES 2025 Innovation Awards, Sky Labs’ Apollon (project name) is a wearable smart ring and wrist-worn silicone module from the 10-year-old South Korean health care startup. Together, these devices are designed to comprehensively monitor vital health indicators, including SpO₂ (arterial blood oxygen saturation), irregular pulse, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and skin temp. Sky Labs says this solution was engineered with hospitalized patients in mind, as Apollon supports extensive health data tracking and analysis. On a related note, Sky Labs' CART BP pro is a ring-type ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device.\n\nSmart “Pins”\n\nLuci, I’m hooome! Actually, Luci will know if you’re home, if you’re talking about the wearable temporal computer platform by OpenInterX Inc. This 2025 Honoree in Artificial Intelligence is a two-part and “privacy-first” system, powered by Life OS, designed to capture and share your world as experienced from your perspective. This is handled through the Luci Pin, a wearable eye with up to four hours of continuous video (via its ultrawide lens and dual microphones – with privacy switch – and the Luci Hub, a mobile processing center that houses the AI’s “brain.” Maybe it’ll live up to the hype, unlike last year’s Rabbit R1 wearable AI?\n\nEven AI Smart Glasses\n\nEven the most functional “smart glasses” won’t be worn unless they look good. This is what Even Realities looked to accomplish with its Even G1, a pair of smart glasses that combines a stylish design with useful augmented reality features. Each lens is a combination of an optical lens and a display lens, bonded together with an eco-friendly adhesive, that lets you do things like translate what someone is saying into your mother tongue in real time; get navigation directions to a chosen destination; have words appear as if with a teleprompter; see hands-free notifications from your phone; and access an AI virtual assistant. Also worth calling out is Gygeslabs’ Halliday Smart Glasses, which impressed at CES.\n\nSmart home appliances\n\nHisense FreshVault French Door Refrigerator\n\nWith the industry’s first vacuum-sealed drawer, the Hisense FreshVault French Door Refrigerator includes a low-oxygen environment that keeps meat fresh for up to five days, saving money and reducing waste, while the antibacterial liners are said to keep the fridge 99.999% bacteria-free for added peace of mind. The VersaTemp+ middle drawer offers variable temperature control via its three-layer vacuum glass door with anti-UV and Low-E (“low emissivity”) coating. On the outside, a black stainless-steel finish and flush door design create a modern aesthetic, and includes features such as a tall ice and water dispenser to support those popular tumblers like Stanley-branded “Quencher” cups.\n\nKara Pod\n\nWhile air-to-water machines (aka atmospheric water generators) aren’t new − they convert water vapor in the air into drinking water – Kara Pod is not only one of the least expensive home units (at $599), but is also the world’s first countertop device that can also brew you a coffee! In other words, it’s a self-refilling coffee machine. As hinted at in the name, Kara Pod is a pod-based coffee machine that takes fully compostable coffee pods made of plant-based fibers. The company Kara Water says it can produce up to 3.2 liters of drinking water a day, which is enough for 18 cups of coffee or seven bottles of water. Recognized as a CES Innovation Awards 2025 Honoree, Kara Pod is “coming soon” and will be available in black, white and beige.\n\nCRAFT GEN 3 Pro+\n\nWith a mission to save beer drinkers from “boring brew,” Exobrew’s CRAFT Gen 3, a CES 2025 Honoree in Home Appliances, is an app-or website-controlled appliance that lets you craft 1.6 gallons in three to 30 days – even if you’re a beginner brewer. Promising professional-quality beverages, Exobrew's single vessel, with reverse heater/cooler technology, can craft a wide range of beer styles using fresh all-grain ingredients, whether you’re craving Lagers, IPAs, Weizens (wheat beer) or Stouts, as well as ciders and kombucha. Follow along with pre-made recipes or unleash your creativity by “drafting” your own.\n\nLG Indoor Garden\n\nDon’t be fooled by its classic floor-standing lamp design: LG’s latest indoor gardening appliance (nope, no name yet) is packed with modern features. Allowing users to produce fresh homegrown greens and other plants, herbs, flowers and fruits, it features a height-adjustable and downward-facing LED light to promote growth and a 1.5-gallon-capacity tank that automatically dispenses water (and/or seeds) based on the number and variety of plants being grown. It also supports the ThinQ app if you want to manage cultivation schedules, adjust lighting settings and monitor plant growth from any location. Despite its 20-plant, four-seed-kit capacity, this condo-friendly appliance can be placed virtually anywhere.\n\nPower/energy solutions\n\nSamsung Air-to-Water Heat Pump\n\nSamsung has been selling heat pumps in the European market since 2009, but now the company is expanding to North America for the first time by introducing the first air-to-water heat pump lineup − the EHS Mono R32 HT Quiet and new Slim Fit EHS ClimateHub units – both equipped with AI Home, including a 7-inch LCD screen on the product to monitor and optimize performance. A slim fit design of the units allows them to be installed in various locations throughout the home, and despite a smaller footprint it houses components such as magnetic filters, three-way valves and an expansion vessel for space heating. Optional, but once these units are connected to Samsung’s SmartThings Energy platform, an AI Energy Mode translates to reduced energy use by up to 17%, Samsung says.\n\nBackup by BioLite\n\nComing in May 2025, Backup By BioLite was created to be an affordable and easy-to-install home Backup solution in the event of a power outage. You can keep your appliances and other devices running through a blackout, which kicks in automatically when needed, delivering up to 60 hours of energy. The company, BioLite, says its Backup solution can be installed in as little as 30 minutes, in virtually any room: Plug Backup into a standard wall outlet, then plug your critical devices into Backup. No rewiring or electricians needed. At just 2.8 inches deep, it can be tucked behind a fridge or under a bed, or left in a cabinet. The Backup app sends alerts about outages and can schedule usage to save money on your utility bill.\n\nBLUETTI SwapSolar Ecosystem MultiCooler\n\nWhether you use it on camping trips or while RVing or during natural disasters at home when the power goes out, this 2025 Honoree in Sustainability & Energy/Power is the world’s first LFP (lithium iron phosphate battery)-powered multi-cooler on wheels, with four ways to charge, a companion app and an integrated icemaker. Along with three days of power, removable battery packs and solar charging ensure an even longer runtime if needed. It boasts up to 1,800 watts of continuous output and 2,700 watts of lifting power (thanks to its twin batteries), so you can also charge up multiple devices simultaneously with its several USB-A, USB-C and AC ports.\n\nPhoto and video\n\nGoPro HERO13 Black\n\nAlready available for purchase and garnering positive reviews, the new GoPro HERO13 proves to be a significant update to its action camera lineup. Despite having the same processor and sensor as the HERO12, advanced features includes a new interchangeable lens system (supporting ultrawide, macro, and anamorphic) that are automatically detected when attached; four neutral density filters (4, 8, 16, and 32); better battery life; improved high-dynamic range (HDR) performance; a magnetic mounting system; and optional USB-C passthrough.\n\nHOVERAir X1 by Zero Zero Robotics\n\nFounded by two Stanford PhDs, Zero Zero Robotics showcased its HOVERAir lineup of self-flying cameras at CES, including the pocket-sized HOVERAir X1, the action-centric HOVERAir X1 PRO, and the pro-grade HOVERAir X1 PROMAX. Unveiled at CES, the X1 weighs just 125 grams and allows owners to shoot aerial photography without the need for a controller or app, thanks to five preprogrammed flight paths, including Hover, Follow, Zoom Out, Orbit, and Bird’s Eye. Video resolution tops 2.7K, while the PRO and PROMAX models, launched last summer, offer 4K/60fps (frames per second) video and 8K/30fps video (with 4K/120fps slow-motion capabilities), respectively.\n\nGaming\n\nROG Flow Z13 Gaming Tablet\n\nPortability meets power with the 2025 ROG Flow Z13, a versatile 13-inch gaming tablet on a kickstand you can prop up, pair with a Bluetooth controller, and game on your airplane tray, in a dorm room, or just about anywhere. The 2.5K ROG Nebula 180Hz touchscreen display includes Pantone validation for 100% DCI P3 color coverage, a durable CNC aluminum unibody chassis, and 70-watt-hour battery for up to 10 hours of usage. It’s considered a “2-in-1” tablet, because you can add a laptop-like keyboard for when you need to get work done.\n\nMSi Claw 8 AI+\n\nHandheld PCs have been an emerging and popular category for gamers on the go, and we saw a couple at CES worth calling out. Along with Lenovo’s Legion Go S that runs on Valve’s SteamOS platform, we really liked the MSi Claw 8 AI+, which is powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra 7 258V with 2nd Gen ARC graphics. A powerful and efficient processor, this latest Claw computer has a new and larger 8-inch display, long-lasting 82-watt-hour battery (providing more than four hours of gameplay on even the most demanding titles) and console-like controls to grip on each side of the screen.\n\nEmoTense Real-Time Haptic Response XR Suit\n\nSouth Korea’s iPOP Co. – a company with more than 30 patents in motion capture and haptic (vibration) feedback technologies – chose CES to showcase its wearable EmoTense XR Suit, which adds more realism to mixed reality experiences. Featuring a two-layer haptic module that combines vibrations and electrical muscle stimulation, it adds a tangible layer to a digital experience, so the wearer feels what’s happening inside their headset. In a game, for example, if someone is shot in a sci-fi military game, they’ll sense the impact on a specific part of their body.\n\nAge-tech/accessibility\n\nELEHEAR Beyond Pro\n\nAlready enjoying success with its over-the-counter and relatively affordable ELEHEAR Beyond hearing aids, the company is letting CES attendees test-drive its next-gen AI-enhance hearing aids at CES, dubbed ELEHEAR Beyond Pro, available later in 2025. Along with its “several upgrades” to enhance sound clarity and offer new convenience features, Beyond Pro will offer a new Champagne colorway, proprietary VOCCLEAR technology and 20 customizable masking sounds. The hearing aids will also feature real-time AI-powered translation that supports live translations across multiple languages. ELEHEAR says the app will be easy-to-use and customizable and will let iPhone or Android users enjoy music and calls, with personalized compensation adjustments and volume controls.\n\nGrandPad\n\nThough it made its debut in 2024, GrandPad was at CES to show off the latest features of its purpose-built tablet for Americans ages 75 and older. Simple to use, this 8-inch tablet houses large app “buttons,” bright colors and a GrandPad app for the administrator (such as a family caregiver) who can add photos, expand the lineup of games and more. GrandPad comes charged out of the box and lies against a charging dock to juice up while simultaneously propping up the device for hands-free video calls. A new “Grandie” AI feature serves as a personal companion.\n\nField Labs Compass Wearable\n\nAlready available for $99 (down from $169) as a special launch price, Compass Wearable is a small and lightweight device worn around the neck that, when paired with a companion app, can automatically transcribe audible conversations into text to read later – no need to remember to press record. AI then summarizes discussions, generates reminders and lists, and may prompt you to ask follow-up questions about the captured notes. While busy professionals can benefit from this clever tool, it could be especially helpful for those struggling with memory problems, such as people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, since conversations are recorded and transcribed. Battery life lasts a day between charges. The price includes 10 hours a month of the Compass X subscription service. An unlimited subscription costs $14 a month (billed annually).\n\nHealth and fitness\n\nAbbott Labs Lingo\n\nFrom Abbott − a global leader in diabetes care and the creators of the wearable Freestyle Libre biosensor that measures glucose levels – comes its latest high-tech solution, Abbott Lingo. Worn on the back of the arm for up to 14 days, it continuously measuring glucose levels in interstitial fluid; the biosensor then sends data to a smartphone app in real time (only iPhone, to start), which provides personalized insights and coaching – to help you understand your metabolism and learn new eating habits and perhaps lifestyle changes to be a healthier you. Lingo costs $49 for one 14-day sensor, $89 for two sensors and four-week plan, or $249 for six sensors and 12-week plan, and is designed for people 18 years and older who are not on insulin.\n\nPoint Biotech\n\nAccording to Point Biotech, the incidence of malignant lymphoma in dogs can be up to five times higher than in humans. As such, early detection of tumors can be critical for treatment, though conventional optical imaging systems can detect tumors in only a dark room – until now. Point Biotech has developed a handheld tumor-detecting tool that works even in ambient light, with the help of testing by researchers at Harvard Medical School.\n\nFaceHeart CardioMirror\n\nBilled as the first AI-powered smart mirror for cardiac health assessments, FaceHeart CardioMirror from FaceHeart Corp. can record a 45-second “selfie” that may detect heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib), with 90% accuracy, says the company. It can also provide many other health-related readings, such as heart and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV), a “Stress Index,” and more. and Stress Index. This 2025 Honoree in Digital Health uses its FDA-cleared remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology and deep learning models for these AI analyses.\n\nKingSmith Fitness’ WalkingPad Treadmill, Rower\n\nUnderstandably, those who live in small spaces, such as an apartment or condo unit, may not want a treadmill to take up half a room. At CES 2025, KingSmith Fitness showed off its latest treadmills and rowers, which are not only compact but foldable for when you need to put them away until your next exercise session. For example, the new WalkingPad Treadmill cleverly collapses and slides under a couch, while the tri-fold water rower can be folded into a compact cube.

Actually, it looks like a dolphin. On display at CES 2025, the solar electric vehicle requires no charging for most daily use – up to 40 miles of solar-powered driving a day – with the option to plug in to charge for 400 miles on a single charge in under an hour. Aptera says it’s in its final development stage before it kicks off series production.\n\nLand Aircraft Carrier\n\nAnd now for something completely different. Chinese automaker Xpeng AeroHT, a division of electric car maker Xpeng, garnered buzz at CES for its wild Land Aircraft Carrier concept. It might be best described as an electric minivan that launches a large, foldable passenger drone out of the back. Yes, you read that correctly. So, after you drive to your destination in the six-wheeled extended range “Mothership” vehicle – say, to a beach – two people can then climb into the eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) drone to soar the friendly skies for an afternoon of sightseeing. The minivan does have a combustion engine at the front that sends power to the car’s electric motors and battery, which also juices up the drone. Xpeng AeroHT said production and deliveries will start sometime in 2026 in China.\n\nHolographic Windshield Display\n\nAt CES, global automotive supplier Hyundai Mobis showcased its Holographic Windshield Display, a first-of-its-kind display that projects driving information across the entire width of the windshield.

Europe wrestles with its Russian ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nWhen you turn on the heating in your home, you may not think much about where your energy comes from, let alone where the money you pay for it goes. For millions of people living in Europe, there’s a good chance that money is flowing to the Russian state — much of it into President Vladimir Putin’s war chest.\n\nRussia has been building a network of natural gas pipelines throughout Europe since the 1960s. Washington has been warning its Western allies ever since that more Russian gas will only make Europeans more vulnerable to Moscow.\n\nThere are fears now that the Kremlin may turn off the supply of natural gas to the European Union, in retaliation for its support for Ukraine — Europe, among other allies, has been sending weapons and aid to Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia’s invasion.\n\nIt’s only been just over a week, but so far, Russia has let the gas flow. But that presents another problem.\n\nRussia is earning hundreds of millions of dollars a day from its oil and gas exports, undermining the financial sanctions Western powers have introduced to choke off financing for Putin’s war effort. The European Union, Russia’s biggest gas customer, is now grappling with the reality that its energy spending has helped empower Putin to carry out a bloody war on its borders.\n\nAccording to the European think thank Bruegel, with prices at record highs, the value of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union has soared to about €500 million ($545 million) every day. That’s up from about €200 million ($220 million) in February. Before the invasion, Russia was also exporting oil worth hundreds of millions a day to Europe.\n\nEU leaders have been talking about reducing reliance on Russian gas for years. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki put it plainly last week. “We are buying, as [the] European Union, lots of Russian gas, lots of Russian oil. And President Putin is taking the money from us, from the Europeans. And he is turning this into aggression, invasion,” he told an EU summit, according to reports.\n\nFor gas alone, the 27-country bloc relies on Russia for 40% of its needs. By country, Germany is Russia’s biggest customer, relying on the nation for more than half of its gas, according to Bruegel.\n\nIn turn, Russia needs Europe’s money. Russian oil and gas revenues in 2021 were worth 9.1 trillion rubles, which in January this year converted to $119 billion, Reuters reports. That made up 36% of the country’s budget.\n\nMoscow’s international reserves now stand at $630 billion, its highest ever, making for a huge war fund. But its financial firepower has been severely constrained by Western sanctions that analysts estimate have frozen about half of those assets.\n\nThose sanctions are battering the Russian economy, but they haven’t yet targeted fossil fuel exports directly, so concerned are Western governments about soaring energy prices and the cost of living. Ultimately, they want Russian gas, at least, to keep flowing.\n\nOil is another story. While the price of benchmark Brent crude soared this week, trading at around $115 a barrel on Friday, Russia’s flagship Urals crude was offered at a discount of $18 a barrel, a sign that some buyers are shunning it.\n\nBanks and traders fear getting caught up in financial sanctions, and shipping companies and insurers are worried about the risk to tankers in the Black Sea.\n\nBesides, Europe can buy oil from elsewhere. Replacing Russia natural gas is more difficult.\n\nTurning the heat down can save huge amounts of gas\n\nProponents of climate action have for years pushed for a plan to wean the world off natural gas, which is a potent planet-warming fossil fuel. It has taken an energy crisis and bloodshed in Ukraine to finally kick EU institutions into gear.\n\nEU energy chief Kadri Simson said Thursday that the bloc will release its plan next week for reducing its reliance on Russian gas, and for speeding up the adoption of more renewable energy.\n\n“Beyond the short term, ultimately … the only lasting solution is the Green Deal, boosting renewables and energy efficiency as fast as technically possible. So we are still far too dependent on fossil fuel imports,” she said at a press conference with the International Energy Agency.\n\nGermany, which had aimed to transition to 100% renewables by 2040, has already brought its target forward by five years, since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has also injected new urgency into conversations about whether the world can go on using as much energy as it does. Europe should be able to replace some of Russia’s gas supply, but cutting it out altogether simply isn’t an option for this heating season, experts told CNN previously. Even down the line, replacing Russian gas in full will be difficult.\n\nIEA Executive Director Fatih Birol suggested that Europeans could turn down their thermostats as part of the solution.\n\nAccording to a 10-point plan aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas, the IEA says that if all buildings in the European Union turned down the heat by just 1 degree Celsius, the bloc would save 10 billion cubic meters of gas. That’s roughly the same amount of natural gas New York City consumes in three months, or what Hungary consumes over a year.\n\nActually asking people to do this would be something of a last resort, said Ben McWilliams, a climate and energy analyst at Bruegel.\n\n“But who knows? It’s an unprecedented situation. I could imagine a kind of political campaign, a real push by European leaders saying, look, if you can help us by turning down 1 degree on your thermostat, it’s going to help. And you can see people uniting behind this, against Russian gas,” he told CNN. “But ultimately, you’ll need much more than this in response.”\n\nOne approach would be to replace around half the gas from other sources, McWilliams said. The United States is already shipping Iiquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, and EU officials are also looking to countries like Azerbaijan and Qatar.\n\nThe other half will need to come from cutting demand, McWilliams said, especially as Europe prepares for next winter.\n\nHeavy industries, like steelmaking and chemical production, will need to reduce their operations. Homeowners investing in solar panels and heat pumps could help take some pressure off heating systems.\n\nTara Connolly, a campaigner with the international NGO Global Witness who specializes in gas, says that Europe must launch an emergency program to insulate homes, replace gas boilers with heat pumps and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.\n\n“It is abundantly clear that Europe’s gas dependence has provided Putin with the resources to engage in his bloody venture in Ukraine, whilst hampering Europe’s response,” she said. “This moment has shown that not only are fossil fuels wrecking the climate, they are contributing to a more volatile and dangerous world.”", "authors": ["Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/05/10/microsoft-build-2017-satya-nadella-bots-cloud-windows-what-to-expect/101480640/", "title": "Microsoft Build 2017: CEO Satya Nadella to talk bots, AI, Windows ...", "text": "Marco della Cava\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft Build 2017 kicks off Wednesday morning in Seattle, a homecoming for the tech giant after years of holding its annual developers conference here in San Francisco.\n\nThat's an apt rally-the-troops move considering the escalating battle between some of tech's biggest companies in the arenas of artificial intelligence, home-assistant hardware and augmented reality.\n\nSome 5,500 developers have heeded the Redmond, Wash., company's call, helping Build sell out in a day.

But an image Zuckerberg recently posted to his Facebook page served as a reality check of sorts for virtual reality, at least in its current form.\n\nThe image, which was also included in a company blog post, showed his blocky, cartoon-like avatar in Facebook-parent Meta’s flagship social app, Horizon Worlds, staring out into the distance with enormous, vacant-looking eyes and a tight-lipped smile. In the background, plopped onto a field of green grass, were simple-looking models of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona, to mark the launch of Horizon Worlds in France and Spain in mid-August.\n\nThe criticism online came swiftly. “Imagine spending billions on the metaverse and your avatar looks like this!” one Twitter user wrote. “Mark Zuckerberg invents The Sims!” another tweeted. Days later, Zuckerberg himself admitted the image was “pretty basic” and posted a screenshot of a more detailed version of his avatar, saying that “major updates” to Horizon and avatar graphics are “coming soon.” He promised to share more details at Connect, Meta’s annual conference focused on VR and augmented reality, which is held in the fall.\n\nThe episode is the just latest example of how difficult (and increasingly important) it is to create highly detailed VR avatars, even for a tech giant that has invested heavily in buying and building hardware and software. Having positioned itself as a leader in the small but growing VR market, Meta faces dueling challenges: Users have high expectations for what they should be able to look like in virtual spaces, but meeting them is, in many ways, difficult with today’s headsets.\n\nScreenshots of Mark Zuckerberg's avatars in Horizon Worlds. After being teased for the first picture (left), he posted an example of what he says is coming soon (right). From Facebook/Meta\n\nVR avatars must look good (or at least good enough) and function reliably in real time and in apps that are typically running on untethered headsets like Meta’s Quest devices rather than on bulky but more powerful laptop or desktop computers. There are many other non-technical issues at play as well, including that different people have different expectations for how avatars should look and act in different situations. Should the avatars look like the VR user themselves, or someone else, or, say, a giant stick of butter?\n\n“Avatars have been very hard to get done, even in the visual effects industry,” said Abhijeet Ghosh, the chief technology officer and chief scientist at London-based Lumirithmic, which uses tablets and smartphones to capture 3-D facial scans for a range of applications, including VR.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for an interview about the challenges of avatar creation. In an April episode of his monthly podcast, “Boz to The Future,” Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth pointed out how vital avatars are across all kinds of digital experiences.\n\n“They’re extremely critical to how people represent themselves in digital spaces, within the metaverse and beyond,” he said.\n\nThe technical challenges\n\nMeta is not alone in the blocky simplicity of its VR avatars. Meta, Rec Room, and Microsoft’s AltSpaceVR, among others, have been working for years to improve the appearance of their avatars and make them increasingly customizable.\n\nThose who mocked how Zuckerberg looked in Horizon Worlds were probably expecting much more realistic illustrations from a giant company such as Meta, given the realism of characters in popular video games like “Call of Duty” or “Gears of War,” Ghosh said. “But I guess people don’t understand the effort that goes into high-end visual effects,” he said, which in the video game realm can include a team of artists dedicated to modeling characters’ appearances.\n\nAt its most basic, untethered headsets like Meta’s Quest 2 still have a slew of technical limitations that make it hard for apps to offer extremely detailed VR avatars that can also respond in real time to the ways we move our faces and other body parts.\n\nThere can be limitations related to the power of the computer, graphics processor, and the amount of included RAM. Moreover, most people currently using VR don’t use extra sensors to track their entire bodies, so sensor-based tracking is limited to what’s built into the headset and any accompanying hand controllers. (This is also why avatars on some social apps, such as Horizon Worlds and Rec Room, exist only from the torso upwards.)\n\nEssentially, today’s headsets can only render so many of the triangles that are used to make up 3-D images in VR, explained Timmu Tõke, CEO and cofounder of avatar creation platform Ready Player Me, which lets people create avatars that they can use across a range of games and apps such as VRChat. This means that if a social app wants to include high-definition avatars, it will only be able to support a handful of people in a scene.\n\nHorizon Worlds currently suggests developers who build their own worlds limit them to eight to 12 users at a time. “More players will require more resources to render your world, and may add some limitations when building,” the company’s Horizon Worlds creation tutorial states.\n\n“Creating an avatar that looks good and performs good — in a VR environment, especially — is extremely hard,” Tõke said.\n\nTrying to bridge the uncanny valley\n\nMeta is trying, however. Since 2019, the company has been working not just on building good-looking avatars, but full-body ones with photorealistic faces, which it thinks are key for feeling immersed when interacting with others in VR.\n\nThis effort matches what Guo Freeman, an assistant professor at Clemson University, found when researching what people want when it comes to VR avatars in social settings. She repeatedly heard that they want an avatar that is consistent with how they look in the non-digital world, she said.\n\n“What is kind of different between social VR and other types of gaming and virtual worlds is people want to build an avatar that looks like them,” she said.\n\nThe customized avatar creation process on Ready Player Me. From Ready Player Me\n\nCreating a photorealistic VR avatar of the average headset wearer remains a monumental task, however. A person’s face and facial expressions must first be scanned to create a 3-D model of their head (or their entire body, to create an avatar that looks like them from head to toe), which can then be animated. This process currently tends to require a large rig of equipment, including cameras, lights, and computers.\n\nGhosh said Lumirithmic is working to make this simpler and more accessible by using off-the-shelf electronics like an arrangement of smartphones and tablets, but it’s still in the early stages. Eventually, he envisions people will be able to scan their own faces at home or at a mall, and use that for a VR avatar.\n\nThe more realistic-looking the avatar’s face, though, the more VR experts told CNN Business they worry about the issue of the Uncanny Valley, which is the disturbing feeling some people have in response to human-like representations that aren’t quite human.\n\n“It’s just extremely hard to create a realistic avatar that crosses the Uncanny Valley,” Tõke said. “It just ends up looking creepy.”\n\nAnd not everyone wants to want to look like themselves in VR, or even like a human. A quick visit to popular VR social app VRChat makes this clear: You might walk into a virtual bar and smack into a dinosaur, a chicken, or something else entirely. Cam Mullen, CEO and cofounder of Nevermet, a dating app that helps people get to know each other via their avatars, told CNN Business he likes to appear in VRChat as a jalapeno pepper.\n\n“You can be an avatar that’s more masculine, more feminine; you can be a furry, you can be a flower. You get to express yourself freely,” he said. “And you can tell a lot about a person’s personality by the avatar they choose to embody.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business/equifax-wrong-credit-scores", "title": "Equifax issued wrong credit scores for millions of consumers | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCredit giant Equifax sent lenders incorrect credit scores for millions of consumers this spring, in a technology snafu with major real-world impact.\n\nIn certain cases the errors were significant enough — the differential was at least 25 points for around 300,000 consumers — that some would-be borrowers may have been wrongfully denied credit, the company said in a statement.\n\nShares fell about 2% Tuesday on the report and were down nearly 5% and shortly after the open Wednesday.\n\nThe problem occurred because of a “coding issue” when making a change to one of Equifax’s servers, according to the company, which said the issue “was in place over a period of a few weeks [and] resulted in the potential miscalculation” of credit scores.\n\nWhile Equifax did not specify dates or figures, a June 1 alert from housing agency Freddie Mac to its clients said Equifax told the agency that about 12% of all credit scores released from March 17 to April 6 may be have been incorrect.\n\nEquifax wrote that “there was no shift in the vast majority of scores” and that “credit reports were not affected.” But the company declined to comment to CNN Business about how people can learn whether they were among those whose credit scores were incorrectly reported — and what recourse they may have if they were issued loans at a higher rate or denied a loan outright because of the snafu.\n\nEquifax issued its statement later Tuesday, hours after the Wall Street Journal published a report about the errors. Trade publication National Mortgage Professional had reported in May that Equifax was warning lenders about the possibility of incorrect scores, and the company released a statement to the magazine at the time acknowledging the technology-based error.\n\nTuesday’s disclosure about the score errors comes just after Equifax said its board voted to give CEO Mark Begor a $25 million retention bonus package.\n\nLast Friday’s regulatory filing announcing the bonus said the board believes Boger is “uniquely qualified to continue to lead the Company during the final stages of our $1.5 billion technology transformation.”\n\nEquifax tracks the credit history of millions of borrowers — almost all Americans — and sells that information to banks and other lenders. As one of only three major credit reporting companies, Equifax plays an outsized role in the credit-score business: Its information helps lenders set interests for borrowers or deny borrowers seeking mortgages, car loans or credit cards.\n\nThis isn’t the first data issue for Equifax.

Nearly half said that foreign workers are either significantly less likely or refusing to relocate to China because of the zero Covid policy.\n\n“We understand China choosing to prioritize health and safety above all else, but the current measures are throttling US business confidence in China,” said Colm Rafferty, chairman for the chamber in China, in a statement that accompanied the survey results.\n\n“Our member companies urge the government to achieve a more optimal balance between pandemic prevention, economic development, and opening-up of the country,” he added.\n\nEuropean businesses warn China\n\nEuropean businesses are also worried.\n\nAs many as 23% of European businesses are considering shifting investments out of China — the highest proportion in a decade— according to a flash survey released by the EU Chamber of Commerce in China late last week.\n\n“China has to change the strategy,” Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told CNN Business in a phone interview.\n\n“We had two good years. But now it’s time to act differently. Zero Covid might not be the right tool now.”\n\nJoerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, is pictured during an interview in Beijing, China, on Thursday Jan. 20, 2022. Simon Song/Reuters\n\nWuttke said most European business were positive in January, as China’s stringent Covid approach had proved successful in containing the spread of the virus at that time, and the economy kept growing.\n\nBut the highly contagious Omicron variant has put Beijing’s zero Covid policy under its greatest test, and massive lockdowns have brought economic activity to a halt in major cities. At least 31 cities are under full or partial lockdown, according to CNN’s latest calculations.\n\nIn April, China’s gigantic services sector contracted at the second sharpest pace on record as Covid lockdowns hit small businesses hard. Its manufacturing sector also shrank sharply, sending the economy backwards.\n\n“We’ve seen damage to our business,” Wuttke said, adding that companies are putting investment on hold because of what’s happening in China.\n\nThe flash survey showed that 78% of the 372 respondents feel that China is a less attractive investment destination because of its more stringent Covid restrictions.\n\n“What’s really hurting the economy is the lack of visibility,” Wuttke said. “Nobody has any idea when this situation is going to change.”\n\n“Chinese officials are painfully aware of the economic pain [caused by Covid policy].

Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n“The Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,” Bowser.\n\n-Zac Anderson\n\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\n\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\n\nIn fact, crime in the capital “is the lowest it has been in over 30 years,” according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence − those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.”\n\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves’ recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\n\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting “the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.”\n\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nTrump says on police response to protesters: ‘You spit and we hit’\n\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: “You spit and we hit.”\n\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\n\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\n“They're not going to be fighting back long,” Trump said,\n\nApparently recalling previous street protests where officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\n“They love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face. And I said you tell them, ‘You spit and we hit,'\" Trump said. “And they can hit real hard. It's a disgusting thing.\"\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\n‘Political theater,’ says top Democrat\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sharply criticized President Trump’s takeover of the Washington D.C. police department as “political theater,” and said the nation’s capital doesn’t need it because it’s already reducing violent crime.\n\n\"What the president did this morning was political theater,” said Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n“His idea of federalizing the police force of D.C. ignores the reality,” Durbin said at a news conference to discuss the Texas state House Democrats who are boycotting a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional districts.\n\n“They are making dramatic progress in reducing violent crime in D.C., so it's a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein,\" added Durbin, a longtime Democratic leader who that he will retire and not seek reelection in 2026.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nTrump says he's looking at downgrading marijuana\n\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\n\"We're looking at reclassification and we'll make a determination over the next few weeks,\" Trump said during his Aug. 11 press conference.\n\nThough 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug.\n\n-Sarah Wire\n\nTrump longs for completed White House ballroom\n\nPresident Trump brought up his plans to build a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House to the overflowing room of journalists packed into his Aug. 11 media briefing.\n\n“I would've certainly loved to have had it today,\" the president said of the construction project that isn't slated to be completed until 2029. \"We would've filled it up.\"\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nHegseth to 'work with state governors' to use more National Guard troops\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is authorized to \"work with state governors\" to use their states' National Guard troops \"if necessary\" to deploy Washington, D.C., according to Will Scharf, an aide to President Donald Trump.\n\nHegseth got the green light in the presidential memo that Trump signed directing National Guard troops into Washington, Scharf said.

Metropolitan Police Department\n\nSeparately, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington. He said the memorandum also authorized Hegseth to work with governors of other states to utilize their National Guards as well.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump: 800 D.C. National Guard troops will be mobilized\n\nPresident Donald Trump said 800 troops from the Washington, D.C., National Guard will be mobilized. He said more could be tapped to join them.\n\n\"If necessary we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" he said.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nTroops will be 'flowing into the streets of Washington'\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Washington, D.C., National Guard was mobilized the morning of August 11 at President Trump's direction.\n\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Hegseth said. Hegseth said other National Guard units and \"specialized units\" stood ready.\n\n\"They will be strong. They will be tough,\" he said.\n\n\"We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure this city is safe, this city is beautiful.\"\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\n'It’s embarrassing,' Trump says of DC crime before Putin summit\n\nAs he announced the federal takeover of Washington, D.C., police, Trump said he didn’t want to be talking the subject days before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“This is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” he said. “I'm gonna see Putin. I'm going to Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capitol was with graffiti all over the walls.”\n\nThe leaders are scheduled to meet on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the three-year Russian war on Ukraine, in the first in-person meeting since Trump took office for his second term.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nTrump puts new DEA chief in charge of DC police\n\nTrump announced that Drug Enforcement Administrator Terrance Cole will take over Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n“You’ll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, okay?” Trump told Cole, standing on the stage with him. “And you run them tough, they're good. You have a lot of good people.”\n\nCole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23, following his Senate confirmation.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nTrump declares public safety emergency, says Bondi will take command of DC police\n\nTrump said he is declaring a public safety emergency in Washington D.C. and announced Attorney General Pam Bondi will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nTrump said his new DEA administrator Terry Cole will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\n\nTrump said he will notify Congress and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser about the moves.\n\n“This is an emergency. This is a tragic emergency,” Trump said.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump suggests crime crackdown could extend to other US cities\n\nTrump seemed to suggest he could later pursue federal intervention to combat crime in places like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n“We’re not going to lose our cities over this,” Trump said as he railed against what he called rising crime rates. “And this will go further. We’re starting very strongly with D.C., and we’re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.”\n\nTrump was flanked by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as he gave his remarks.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says he’s deploying National Guard, taking control of police department\n\nTrump said he is sending National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to crack down on crime in the nation’s capital.\n\nTrump cited authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington’s police department.\n\n“This is liberation day in D.C.,\" Trump said, touting his moves as “historic action to rescue our nation from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.”\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nSen. Mike Lee: Time to take over DC\n\nAhead of Trump’s press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said now is the time for Congress to take control of the city.\n\n“We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,” Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\nThe legislation, dubbed “Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident” was introduced earlier this year, and was named after D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\n\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\n−Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\n\nWhite House says DC’s murder rate leads other national capitals\n\nAhead of Trump’s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.’s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\n\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\n\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\n\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\n\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\n\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors − an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\n\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\n\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\n\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n“Remember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don’t believe Trump’s lies,” Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\n\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi, Josh Meyer and Zac Anderson\n\nNo DC crime surge, mayor says\n\nA spokesman for Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declined to comment ahead of Trump’s news conference.\n\nBut during an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” Bowser pushed back at Trump’s claims of rising crime in Washington. “We are not experiencing a crime spike,” the mayor said.\n\nBowser expressed concern about sending the National Guard into the capital, noting that Guard troops are not meant to enforce local laws.\n\n“I’m concerned about them not being used efficiently. And I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our guard,” Bowser said. “But that’s the president’s call about how to deploy the guard.”\n\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump’s threats about taking over Washington.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\n\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\n\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\n\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\n\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\n\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\n\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nTrump threatens to take over DC\n\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved ‒ something he floated previously in February.\n\n\"If D.C. doesn’t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they’re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\n\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\n\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/11/trump-dc-national-guard-crime-crackdown-takeaways/85609416007/", "title": "President Trump is taking over Washington forces: 5 takeaways", "text": "President Donald Trump laid out an aggressive plan for the federal government to take over law enforcement in Washington and teased that the same force might be coming to other cities across the country.\n\nJoined by top administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the president announced the National Guard will be deployed in the nation's capital and that the local police will be placed under federal control.\n\n\"This is an emergency,\" Trump said. \"This is a tragic emergency.\"\n\nThe president painted a dark portrait of the city throughout an Aug. 11 press conference, describing it as overrun by homeless people, drug addicts and other \"bloodthirsty criminals\" that his administration will no longer tolerate.\n\nMany residents and activists have long resisted those characterizations as false and racially motivated attacks against the city, which has lobbied for statehood in recent years.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser pushed back at the president's claims of rising crime over the weekend, saying residents \"are not experiencing a crime spike.\" She underscored the need for D.C. statehood during a separate press conference on Aug. 11 hours after Trump's comments.\n\n\"We are American citizens. Our families go to war, we pay taxes and we uphold the responsibilities of citizenship,\" Bowser said. \"And while this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised.\"\n\nBut Trump and his allies have been keen on spotlighting individual violent crimes against reporters, White House aides and congressional staffers that often seize headlines and startle tourists.\n\nDemocrats and other critics pointed out that Washington's homicide rate is down 32% year-to-date, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. They called Trump's move another abuse of his executive authority.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Trump's press conference.\n\nTrump administration taking over DC police\n\nTrump signed two executive orders, the first invoking the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of Washington police for 48 hours if they determine \"that special conditions of an emergency nature exist...\"\n\nSuch a takeover can be extended with congressional approval but any request of more than 30 days must be passed into law.\n\nIn a separate order, Trump ordered Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, which also authorized him to work with governors of other states to utilize their guard as well.\n\nKey officials within the administration are now being tasked with overseeing DC's law enforcement agencies, including Bondi, who will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole, who was sworn in last month, will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\n\nWhite House spotlights DOGE staffer and other crime victims\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump sprinkled in many individual cases of violent crime that he argued justified his takeover, such as the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum.\n\nOne at the top of mind was the assault of Edward Coristine, who worked as a staffer with the Department of Government Efficiency. An Aug. 3 police report, obtained by USA TODAY, said officers observed a group of about 10 juveniles surrounding Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m.\n\n\"He was left dripping in blood,\" Trump said. \"He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive. He can't believe it.\"\n\nThe president also evoked Phillip Todd, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who was stabbed in 2023. Trump described the attacker, identified by police as Glynn Neal, as a \"demented lunatic.\"\n\nIn an August profile by The Washington Post, Todd, a son of Christian missionaries, said that he had forgiven Neal and was rethinking his views on crime and punishment.\n\nChicago, other cities could see federal oversight, Trump warns\n\nWhile ticking off individual cases, Trump noted that his Washington takeover might be brought to cities including Chicago; Baltimore; Los Angeles and Oakland, California.\n\nThose Democratic-controlled cities and states, Trump said, have adopted left-leaning policies, such \"no cash bail\" rules, that he blamed for violent crime.\n\n\"This issue directly impacts the functioning of the federal government, and is a threat to America, really,\" he said. \"It's a threat to our country. We have other cities also that are bad, very bad.\"\n\nChicago was in the news earlier this summer for a historic drop in crime that Mayor Brandon Johnson, who Trump called out during the press conference, has touted.\n\n\"This reduction in hate crimes and of violence generally is a testament to what’s possible when we invest in people and community safety in a holistic way,\" Johnson said in a July 18 statement that credited \"strategic, constitutional policing\" and \"jobs for young people, access to mental health care, and housing people can afford.\"\n\nSimilar trends have occurred in Baltimore, which has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and an 18% decline in nonfatal shootings, according to Mayor Brandon Scott.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Democratic Mayor's Association said federal intervention isn't needed and argued the president is looking to create a \"political charade\" to distract voters.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities − including Washington, DC − in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him,\" the group said. \"If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work.\"\n\nCongress' takeover of Washington could come next\n\nTrump's crackdown in Washington could be followed by further changes, specifically to its home rule status, which is often a favorite punching bag for congressional Republicans.\n\nAhead of the president's press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, declared that now is the time for lawmakers to take control of the city.\n\n\"We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,” Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\nThe bill, dubbed “Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident” was introduced earlier this year, and was named after Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption in the city.\n\nLee co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tennessee, and cited an ongoing scandal involving a Washington police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime.\n\nTrump appeared to allude to the Ogles-Lee proposal to rescind home rule. \"We're going to change the statue, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats point fingers on DC statehood while others focus on Trump\n\nNational Democrats took a few swings at Trump's declaration, casting it as a political ploy more than a fight to improve public safety.\n\n\"The most violent cities are in Republican states − and there's no takeover happening there,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, a rumored 2028 presidential contender, said in a post on X. \"This is just another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, described Trump's announcement in stark terms, saying on X: \"The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you’re overreacting.\"\n\nBut some Democrats said the party failed to protect Washington when it had the chance four years ago when Joe Biden was still president and they ran Congress.\n\n\"Trump is going to federalize D.C.,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\n\"Senate Dems could have stopped this when we had power,\" he added \"In 2021, the House voted to make D.C. a state, but a few Senate Dems flinched and genuflected to the filibuster.

The moves angered some of those who live and work in the district, but were welcomed by others, a series of USA TODAY interviews suggests.\n\n\"I saw the warnings about the National Guard, and I was like, 'that's a step too far, I don't like that,'\" said Ernst, who was among dozens of people gathered for a protest near the White House on Aug. 11 to oppose Trump's announcement.\n\nTrump has described Washington, DC as unsafe and violent, pointing to recent crimes like the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer during an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3. While some of those who live in the city expressed similar concerns about crime, others pushed back against Trump's characterization, noting that violent crime in the district is down nearly 30% in 2025 compared to this time last year.\n\n\"It's really just meant to put fear into people, and we're not going to be cowed by him,\" Shelley Moskowitz, who has lived in DC since 1987, said at the protest of Trump's actions. \"We don't need the outside military coming in.

Powell said that in recent weeks, police have been questioning demonstrators more and she fears conflict could erupt now that Trump has mobilized the National Guard.\n\nTrump issued a stern warning to protesters in the city and beyond during the Aug. 11 press briefing in which he declared a public safety emergency in DC, saying \"they're not going to be fighting back long.\"\n\nPowell disagreed. \"He's trying to piss people off, and he's trying to instigate something to occur so that he can justify bringing the National Guard in,\" she said.\n\nPowell also expressed concern about Trump's threat to replicate his approach to DC in other cities including New York, Baltimore and Chicago. She said deploying the National Guard \"did not work\" in Los Angeles, where protesters clashed with police after Trump deployed the National Guard in June.\n\n\"I think the country needs to wake up to what's happening to the country as a whole,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked how she feels about the deployment of National Guard troops, Diane Gronewold had one response: Angry.\n\n\"There's no reason for National Guard to be here,\" said Gronewold, who attended the demonstration with Powell. \"The crime rate is down in DC. There's no trouble.\"\n\nGronewold, who lives just outside the city in Arlington, Virginia, said Mayor Muriel Bowser hasn't been doing enough to counter Trump's threats. During an Aug. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” Bowser refuted Trump’s claims of rising crime in the city and expressed concern about the National Guard deployment, but said \"that’s the president’s call.\"\n\n\"She's in a horrible position,\" Gronewold said, acknowledging Bowser's limited autonomy. \"But I think that the people of DC would like her to do more, and they're willing to suffer more if she will lead.\"\n\nSome DC residents welcome federal oversight\n\nDespite the decline in violent crime, some residents welcomed the idea of an increased police presence.\n\nThe city is already home to many overlapping law enforcement agencies and local police should be able to work well with the National Guard, said Kevin Schilling, who sat on a bench outside the White House wearing a white Trump hat just after the president made his announcement. Schilling, who lives in DC, said he views crime and homelessness as major issues in the city.\n\n\"I guess it's hard to handle,\" Schilling said.\n\nSarah Kimble, who has been living in parks in the city's Northwest quadrant after being turned away from a homeless shelter, said she often fears for her safety in other parts of the city, citing recent outbursts of gun violence like the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a museum.\n\n\"How many children have been hurt? I mean, it's crazy,\" she said. \"So, yeah, I'm glad. Something needs to be overseen at least until they get a handle on it.\"\n\nThough Kimble is still trying to secure housing for herself, she also said she doesn't blame the president for wanting to get rid of homeless encampments. Trump said on social media that the homeless in DC would \"have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" though he did not elaborate on how or where they would go.\n\n\"It is ugly, yeah, so I can get that,\" Kimble said. \"I mean, even if I'm in it, it doesn't mean I like it and I want to stay there.\"\n\nContributing: Sudiksha Kochi, Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/13/national-guard-troops-deployment-washington-dc-residents/85639038007/", "title": "Few National Guard troops seen in DC as residents oppose ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - Residents and tourists in the nation's capitol woke up to relatively few National Guard troops patrolling the streets Aug. 13 amid President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on crime and homelessness.\n\nTrump mobilized 800 members of the guard, though not all have been deployed yet, and ordered the city's Metropolitan Police Department be brought under the control of the Justice Department.\n\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said at an Aug. 12 news conference. \"They will be strong. They will be tough.\"\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser's staff said on Aug. 12 that the largest part of the surge would happen overnight, and the city planned to keep the guardsmen near tourist hotspots like the national monuments. Commanders of the Guard's 273rd Military Police Company shared images on social media of armored Humvees parked next to the Washington Monument.\n\nBut National Guard troops were nowhere to be seen along the National Mall, where tourists walked from monument to monument and an increased police presence could be seen standing on sidewalks and in their squad cars.\n\nFew National Guard troops seen in DC\n\nA roaming group of federal agents and park police patrolled the area and at one point stopped in front of a homeless man and ordered him to move, which he did peacefully.A Park Police helicopter flew around the mall in low circles. There were no National Guard troops to be seen.\n\nEven the area where a former DOGE staffer was assaulted while intervening in an unarmed carjacking - an example of violent crime in the city highlighted by the White House - was quiet with little law enforcement presence.\n\nArea residents told USA TODAY that Trump’s actions were excessive and a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\n“It’s unbelievable,” said Isaiah Walter, who was born and raised in Congress Heights, a majority-Black neighborhood in southeast D.C.\n\nViolent crime is highest in the southeastern corner of the city known as Ward 8, which includes Congress Heights, Navy Yard and Anacostia, according to an interactive map on the city government’s website. But despite that, Walter said he has seen the city become safer over his lifetime, especially in the last several years following the pandemic.\n\n“I don’t think it’s needed,” he said.\n\nThough many residents have expressed disapproval, some have shown support for the president’s decision. While out on a walk with her child on Aug. 12, Rebecca Harkey told Reuters that crime had made her consider leaving the capital and that it was \"very much an active fear\" in her life.\n\nWhat will the National Guard do?\n\nThe mission of 800 DC guard members will resemble how troops are helping immigration agents swarm the southern border, the Army has said.\n\nAccording to the Army, which is responsible for deploying the District of Columbia National Guard, the troops will be tasked with administrative and logistical duties and supporting law enforcement with their \"physical presence.\"\n\nBowser said she hopes her administration can spin Trump's deployment of the guardsmen into a positive for the city given that the department is understaffed by several hundred officers. Police officials are now approaching their deployment strategy to see \"how the additional federal police officers can help in some areas,\" she said.\n\nTrump also told reporters on Aug. 11 that his administration will be getting \"rid of the people from underpasses and public spaces from all over the city.\"\n\n\"We're going to be removing homeless encampments from beautiful parks, which now, a lot of people can't walk on,” Trump said.\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes,Michael Loria and Thao Nguyen, Cybele Mayes-Osterman, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/08/national-guard-los-angeles-protests-live-updates/84103374007/", "title": "LA protests: Downtown Los Angeles declared an unlawful assembly ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page summarizes the Los Angeles protests over ICE raids for Sunday, June 8. For the latest updates on the LA protests, visit USA TODAY's coverage for Monday, June 9.\n\nLOS ANGELES — Tensions escalated in Los Angeles late Sunday between law enforcement and protesters as California National Guard troops arrived in Southern California to quell demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a move that the state's Democratic governor has called unlawful.\n\nTrump ordered the deployment of 2,000 Guard members over the objections of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Trump wanted to create a \"spectacle.\" U.S. Northern Command said about 300 soldiers were on the ground at three locations in the greater Los Angeles area to provide \"safety and protection of federal property and personnel.\"\n\nNewsom said the Guard's deployment was \"unlawful\" and called on the Trump administration to rescind its order in a letter Sunday afternoon. The governor said the decision was a \"serious breach of state sovereignty\" and demanded that the president \"return control\" to California.\n\nMembers of the Guard were stationed around federal government buildings as local police confronted thousands of protesters in separate demonstrations in the city. Authorities declared several demonstrations on Sunday unlawful assemblies and moved in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades, sending hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears.\n\nEarlier, a large group of protesters blocked the 101 Freeway — a major thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles. The freeway was later cleared as protesters converged on an overpass and threw objects down at police, video footage showed. As the crowds dispersed, they left behind masses of graffiti spray-painted on buildings, sidewalks, and signs, mostly criticizing federal authorities and pushing for immigrant rights.\n\nA handful of protesters who remained behind waved Mexican flags at state and local police officers controlling the intersections and streets.\n\nStories of justice and action across the country: Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nTimeline of the events: LA protests went from small to substantial over three days. Here's what unfolded\n\nLAPD chief: 'Act of violence' will be met with 'swift and lawful action'\n\nDuring a news conference Sunday night, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell underscored that protests across the city in recent days had been peaceful and thanked the community for \"expressing their views and their frustration in a responsible manner.\"\n\nThe police chief added that the department’s goal is to maintain order without escalating conflict and protect public safety.\n\n\"When peaceful demonstrations devolve into acts of vandalism or violence, especially violence directed at innocent people, law enforcement officers and others, we must respond firmly,\" McDonnell said. “An act of violence, whether toward officers, demonstrators or the public, will be met with swift and lawful action.\"\n\nMcDonnell noted that authorities recognize immigration enforcement operations can cause a “deep fear and anxiety, particularly in immigrant communities.” He reiterated that LAPD is not involved in ICE operations and called the recent violence amid protests \"disgusting.\"\n\nMcDonnell added that the department had resources to handle the situation and would have gone through a \"number of steps\" before requesting the Guard.\n\n“(The deployment) was done from the top down, from the president directing,” McDonnell said. \"They're working for the U.S. Army, not for the California State National Guard.\"\n\nNewsom says he plans to sue Trump over National Guard deployment\n\nNewsom announced Sunday on MSNBC that he plans to sue the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles.\n\nThe governor said he plans to file the lawsuit on Monday and has lawyers working on the brief, according to the news outlet.\n\n\"He's putting fuel on this fire ever since he announced he was taking over the National Guard in a legal act and a moral act, an unconstitutional act. And we're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,\" Newsom told MSNBC.\n\nThe governor added that he attempted to discuss the protests with Trump on late Friday, saying the president \"never once brought up the National Guard.\"\n\nPolice declare all of downtown LA an unlawful assembly area\n\nLAPD announced Sunday night that all of downtown Los Angeles had been \"declared as an unlawful assembly.\"\n\n\"You are to leave the Downtown Area immediately,\" police warned on a post on X.\n\nShortly after the announcement, police said demonstrators had marched to the L.A. Live area, a live entertainment venue near Crypto.com Arena. Protesters were blocking all lanes of traffic on Figueroa and 11th streets, according to police.\n\nAt about 8 p.m. local time, authorities declared an unlawful assembly for a demonstration near the 101 Freeway, moving in aggressively with flash-bangs and tear gas grenades, sending hundreds of people running, their eyes streaming with tears. One man stopped to pour milk on his face to reduce the tears, and helicopters clattered overhead as protesters fled the area to honking car horns and periodic cheers.\n\nVideos shared on social media and footage from local television stations showed officers in riot gear, and the sound of flash-bangs could be heard in the background. The Los Angeles Times reported that officers could be seen pushing people with batons, and some protesters were observed climbing a fence to get away from the officers.\n\nMany protesters were waving Mexican flags or hybrid Mexican American flags as they chanted \"F--- ICE, leave LA,\" according to the Times. Protestors were also seen throwing water bottles and other objects at officers and law enforcement vehicles.\n\nA massive crowd of protesters had moved onto the 101 Freeway and stopped traffic in both directions, KABC-TV and Spectrum News 1 reported. KABC-TV said protesters created a makeshift barrier on the southbound side of the freeway and were immediately confronted by officers in riot gear.\n\nPolice officers injured after being hit by motorcyclists\n\nLAPD announced on Sunday that two people riding motorcycles \"attempted to breach a skirmish line at Alameda and Temple\" streets, hitting and injuring two police officers. Authorities said the officers were being treated at the scene by medical personnel.\n\nTwo people were detained after the incident, police said.\n\nAccording to preliminary information, police said at least 10 people have been arrested and three officers were injured during protests on Sunday. California Highway Patrol arrested 17 people on the 101 Freeway, police said. On Saturday, police arrested 29 people.\n\nAmong those arrested on Sunday was a person who allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail at an officer and another person who allegedly hit a line of officers with a motorcycle, injuring one, according to LAPD Capt. Raul Jovel.\n\nWhy did Trump deploy the Guard? What to know about the situation in LA\n\nNewsom dares federal authorities to arrest him\n\nNewsom challenged Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, to arrest him for speaking out against federal immigration enforcement that sparked violent protests in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Trump’s border czar is threatening to arrest me for speaking out. Come and get me, tough guy,\" Gavin said on social media. \"I don't give a damn. It won’t stop me from standing up for California.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Homan said, \"I’m telling you what, we’re going to keep enforcing law every day in L.A. Every day in L.A., we’re going to enforce immigration law. I don’t care if they like it or not.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Newsom and Bass, who have criticized the deployment, could be subject to arrest if they hinder operations on the ground, Homan said: \"I’ll say it about anybody. You cross that line, it’s a felony to knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien. It’s a felony to impede law enforcement doing their job.\"\n\nTrump, Homan, and other federal officials have said they would charge anyone who interfered with the immigration operation. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a fiery picture on social media with the caption \"another 'mostly peaceful protest' brought to you by Gavin Newsom. DEPORT,\" Hegseth said.\n\nNewsom’s press office replied by asking whether the Marines would respond the next time the Philadelphia Eagles win the Super Bowl, next to a fiery picture.\n\nNewsom asks Trump to withdraw the National Guard\n\nIn an emailed letter released on Sunday afternoon, Newsom formally asked Hegseth to rescind Trump’s order to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,\" Newsom said in a social media post. \"This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed.\"\n\nThe letter stated that law enforcement resources in Los Angeles County were \"sufficient to maintain order,\" adding that Guard members were deployed without appropriate training or orders, which \"risks seriously escalating the situation.\"\n\n\"In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, State and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property,\" according to the letter.\n\nIn response to Newsom's letter, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Reuters that Trump had \"rightfully stepped in to restore law and order.\"\n\n\"It’s a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" Jackson said. \"Everyone saw the chaos, violence, and lawlessness - unless of course, Gavin Newsom doesn’t think any of that is a problem.\"\n\nPolice declare 'unlawful assembly' in downtown LA protest\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, LAPD said on X that it has placed officers across the city on a \"tactical alert.\" The tactical alert means that all officers can now be redistributed between divisions and must remain on shift until they are relieved by their unit commanders.\n\nThe police department later declared the protest outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles an \"unlawful assembly,\" and authorized the “use of less lethal munitions.\" The department also issued a dispersal order and said arrests were being made.\n\nAccording to the department, officers reported that people in the crowd were throwing concrete, bottles, and other objects.\n\n\"The use of less lethal munitions has been authorized by the Incident Commander,\" the department said in a separate social media post. \"Persons throwing items at officers will be detained and arrested.\"\n\nAnti-ICE protests in downtown LA: The history of National Guard deployments in Los Angeles: What to know\n\nLA mayor blames Trump administration for provoking tensions\n\nBass warned protesters on Sunday not to \"play into the administration’s hands\" and said her office was working with other officials and organizing resources in response to the immigration raids and demonstrations.\n\n\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,” the mayor said during an afternoon news conference on Sunday. \"When you raid Home Depot and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you cause fear and you cause panic.\"\n\nBass called the deployment of federalized troops a \"dangerous escalation\" and said the Trump administration’s decision was not about public safety. She added that she was joining Newsom in appealing to the administration to rescind the order to federalize the Guard and allow the Guard to come back under the control of the governor.\n\n\"I want the people of Los Angeles to know that we stand with all Angelenos,\" Bass said. \"No matter where you were born, the First Amendment right gives you the ability again to protest peacefully, but it does not give you the right to be violent, to create chaos or to vandalize property, and that will not be tolerated. So I call on all Angelenos to continue expressing your right, your anger, your outrage, but to do it peacefully.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers urge protesters to remain calm\n\nState and local leaders encouraged peaceful demonstrations on Sunday night as protests continued in downtown Los Angeles over Trump's immigration enforcement.\n\nIn a news release on Sunday, U.S. Northern Command said about 500 Marines at Twentynine Palms, about 143 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, were put on “prepare to deploy” status.\n\nNewsom was in Los Angeles meeting with officials from the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The governor said local and state emergency officials were working to maintain public safety as they responded to protests that were \"provoked by chaos from Washington.\"\n\n\"We’re here to keep the peace — not play into Trump’s political games,\" Newsom said on X. \"Don’t take the bait. Never use violence or harm law enforcement.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla criticized Trump and said the president was creating \"nothing more than fear and chaos in our communities.\"\n\n\"This is the first time since 1965 National Guard troops are federalized and deployed without the request and support of the Governor or local authorities,\" Padilla said on social media. \"It’s unnecessary, counterproductive, and a misuse of our National Guard.\"\n\nUnion president detained amid protests\n\nProtests erupted on Friday after ICE operations in Los Angeles resulted in the arrests of at least 44 people on alleged immigration violations, according to Reuters. One organized labor leader, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union of California (SEIU California), was injured and detained by ICE at one site, according to an SEIU statement.\n\nThe union said Huerta was arrested \"while exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity.\" He was later released from the hospital after being treated for injuries he sustained during his arrest, but remains in custody, the union added.\n\nNo details about the nature or severity of Huerta's injury were immediately available.\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a post on X on Friday that Huerta \"was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday.\"\n\nThe next day, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Huerta’s immediate release and warned of a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”\n\n'Number of people' arrested; cars set on fire near downtown LA\n\nSeveral protests were observed across Los Angeles County, with the largest in downtown Los Angeles. By 5 p.m. local time, law enforcement authorities cleared the 101 Freeway, and videos showed protestors moving onto an overpass as they chanted and waved Mexican flags.\n\nLAPD later declared an unlawful assembly in the Civic Center area and the historic Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles. Police said demonstrators had halted and ignited several vehicles in the area.\n\nFootage from local television stations showed several driverless robotaxis from Waymo stopped on the road. At least two vehicles were set on fire as smoke was seen billowing into the sky.\n\nBy around 6:15 p.m., LAPD said \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" were on fire in the area of Los Angeles Street, North of Arcadia and South of Alameda streets. Police warned people to avoid the area due to burning lithium-ion batteries releasing toxic gases, posing risks to responders and those nearby.\n\nPolice said a “number of people have been arrested” at the Civic Center area. At around 6:20 p.m., LAPD said \"less lethal munitions\" were authorized in the area of Temple and Main streets as videos showed multiple skirmish lines on roads near City Hall.\n\nPolice said demonstrators were using chairs, garbage bins, and other items to block the street. The department urged protesters to leave the area.\n\nNational Guard deployment in Los Angeles slated for 60 days\n\nTrump’s National Guard deployment of 2,000 troops in Los Angeles is expected to last 60 days, according to a directive from California’s adjutant general.\n\nTrump's memo on June 7 invoked a section of federal code authorizing the president to call the guard into service to \"repel an invasion of the United States by a foreign nation\" or to \"suppress a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or to \"execute the laws of the United States when the President is unable to do so with regular forces.\"\n\nDavid Sapp, Newsom’s legal affairs secretary, said the Guard’s directive was inconsistent with Trump’s memo, which anticipated \"coordinat(ion) with the Governors of the States.\"\n\n\"There is currently no need for the National Guard to be deployed in Los Angeles, and to do so in this unlawful manner and for such a lengthy period is a serious breach of state sovereignty,\" Sapp wrote to Hegseth.\n\nWaymo suspends service after vehicles set on fire: Report\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told NBC News that the company was suspending its service in downtown Los Angeles after multiple self-driving vehicles were reportedly set on fire during protests.\n\n\"We will not be serving any rides in the protest area until it is deemed safe,\" the spokesperson said, according to NBC News.\n\nLAPD said earlier Sunday that \"multiple autonomous vehicles\" were on fire in the area of Los Angeles Street, North of Arcadia and South of Alameda streets. Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to burning lithium-ion batteries releasing toxic gases nearby.\n\nHarris calls National Guard 'dangerous escalation'\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, called the deployment of the National Guard “a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee who lost to Trump in 2024, said in a social media post that Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Southern California and across the country are part of a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\"\n\n\"This Administration’s actions are not about public safety – they’re about stoking fear,\" Harris added.\n\nNewsom accuses Trump's deployment 'acts of a dictator'\n\nNewsom on Sunday accused Trump's order as \"the acts of a dictator\" for deploying National Guard troops to quell violent protests in Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom posted a video of Trump saying he would charge state and local officials federally if they interfere with immigration enforcement, which sparked the protests in Los Angeles. Newsom accused Trump of \"inciting and provoking violence\" as well as \"creating mass chaos\" and \"militarizing cities.\"\n\n\"These are the acts of a dictator, not a President,\" Newsom added.\n\nTrump says LA protests don't qualify as an insurrection yet\n\nTrump told reporters Sunday on his way to Camp David for a meeting with military leaders that he doesn’t think the protests in Los Angeles qualify as an insurrection yet, but that he would be keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\n“No,” he said when asked if an insurrection was happening. “But you’ve got violent people, and we’re not going to let them get away with it.”\n\nTrump said he was sending the National Guard to restore order. “We’re going to have troops everywhere,” Trump said. “We’re not going to let this happen to our country.”\n\nHe said the bar for sending in Marines would be “what I think it is.”\n\n“If we see danger to our country and to our citizens, we will be very, very strong in terms of law and order. It’s about law and order,” Trump said. He said he would be “watching it very closely” to see whether protests are spreading and if a larger federal response is needed.\n\n“We’re going to be watching it very closely,” Trump said. “You know they spit, that’s their new thing. They spit, and worse, you know what they throw at them, right? And when that happens, I have a little statement – they spit, we hit. And I told them, nobody’s going to spit on our police officers. No body’s going to spit on our military.”\n\nLAPD police chief confirms 'heavier deployment'\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell told USA TODAY on Sunday that his department will be \"well prepared\" should any civil unrest occur during the third day of protests across the city.\n\n\"We certainly have a heavier deployment than usual,\" said McDonnell, declining to give a specific number.\n\nThe chief said officers will be deployed outside a federal court building, the Metropolitan Detention Center, City Hall, and some parks where protests and demonstrations against the deportation raids are scheduled to take place.\n\nMcDonnell said the LAPD is still figuring out what role the National Guard will play during any protests as well.\n\n\"It’s still to be determined,\" McDonnell said. \"Some of them just got on the ground, and we’re trying to figure out how we can make this all work for everybody. For the city, the county. and beyond. Our whole focus is on public safety.\"\n\n— Terry Collins\n\nLos Angeles police chief: 'Ready to meet whatever challenges we may face'\n\nTrump directs federal agencies to 'liberate' LA from 'Migrant Invasion'\n\nTrump said on social media that Los Angeles \"has been invaded and occupied\" by undocumented immigrants and he directed the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice to take action to liberate the city.\n\nThe language of his post echoes his executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants accused of being members of criminal gangs he declared terrorist organizations, such as Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua.\n\n\"A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals,\" Trump said. \"Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations.”\n\nTrump directed Hegseth, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Attorney General Pam Bondi “to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.”\n\n“Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,” Trump said.\n\nDemocratic governors blast 'alarming abuse of power'\n\nA group of 22 Democratic governors called Trump’s deployment of the National Guard “an alarming abuse of power” and said doing so without working with Newsom was “dangerous.”\n\n“President Trump’s move to deploy California’s National Guard is an alarming abuse of power,” the governors said in a joint statement. “Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state's governor is ineffective and dangerous.”\n\nThe governors also criticized the threat to send in Marines. “Further, threatening to send the U.S. Marines into American neighborhoods undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement,” the governors said.\n\nDemocratic Govs. Laura Kelly of Kansas, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Bob Ferguson of Washington, Josh Green of Hawaii, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Katie Hobbs of Arizona, Kathy Hochul of New York, Tina Kotek of Oregon, Ned Lamont of Connecticut, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, Dan McKee of Rhode Island, Matt Meyer of Delaware, Janet Mills of Maine, Wes Moore of Maryland, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Jared Polis of Colorado, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Josh Stein of North Carolina, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\n\nFBI deputy director threatens violent protesters with investigation\n\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on social media that if protesters choose violence, they will be investigated and arrested.\n\n\"We will be investigating and pursuing all available leads for assault on a federal officer, in addition to the many arrests already made,\" Bongino said June 8. \"And, although we’ll pursue every case, we don’t need to catch every single perp, we just need to catch you.\"\n\nInvestigations will continue even after calm is restored, he warned.\n\n\"We will not forget,\" Bongino said. \"Even after you try to.\"\n\nHomeland Security secretary flips on Guard issue\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has been a staunch supporter of Trump’s border policies, including his decision to deploy the National Guard to quell disturbances in California. But as governor of South Dakota in February 2024, Noem sharply criticized then-President Joe Biden for considering federalizing the National Guard over Texas’ contentious razor‑wire border operations.\n\nThe Biden White House was reportedly considering the move after the Supreme Court ruled the federal government could cut through razor wire that Texas had placed along the U.S.-Mexico border − wire that similarly obstructs CBP agents’ ability to access the border and carry out their duties.\n\nThat prompted Democrats and others to call on Biden to federalize the Texas National Guard and order it to stand down. In a post on X, Noem said such a move would be a “direct attack on states’ rights.\" Ultimately, Biden never activated the Guard.\n\nAmnesty International accuses Trump of 'instilling fear'\n\nAmnesty International Executive Director Paul O’Brien called the Guard deployment \"deeply alarming.\" He accused Trump of using military force to punish those who speak out for human rights and said the deployment will exacerbate the situation rather than remedy it.\n\n“This is not about protecting communities, this is about crushing dissent and instilling fear,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"Armed troops do not belong in our neighborhoods. This militarization of immigration enforcement and in response to people exercising their right to freedom of expression must have no place in a country that claims to value justice and human rights.\"\n\nLA County Board chairperson calls for restraint, backs right to protest\n\nSupervisor Kathryn Barger, the conservative chairperson of the powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, called for calm but voiced her support for the right of protesters to express themselves.\n\n“I want to remind @CountyofLA residents that the right to protest is a fundamental constitutional freedom and I strongly support the right of individuals to express themselves peacefully,” Barger, who represents the county's northern swaths, said in a posting on X late Saturday night. “However, I urge all those who choose to protest to do so without resorting to violence or unlawful behavior.”\n\nBarger said that as chair of the political body overseeing all of Los Angeles County, including the parts where the National Guard is being deployed, she would closely monitor any developments of civil unrest. That would include “attacks against local, state, or federal law enforcement officers or any attempt to cause them harm,\" she wrote.\n\nBernie Sanders: Trump 'does not believe in the Constitution'\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders said he believes President Donald Trump is “moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism\" after Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to help quell immigration protests in Los Angeles.\n\n“This guy wants all of the power. He does not believe in the Constitution. He does not believe in the rule of law,” Sanders, a Vermont independent, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” \"My understanding is that the governor of California, the mayor of the city of Los Angeles did not request the National Guard, but he (Trump) thinks he has a right to do anything he wants.\"\n\nThe protests were prompted by the Trump administration's push to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants. Demonstrators allege the administration's immigration enforcement violates civil and human rights.\n\nDHS: Immigrants arrested include murderers, rapists\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced that the immigrants without legal authorization to be in the country include murders and rapists.\n\nThose arrested during the Los Angeles operation that sparked violent protests include a Vietnamese man convicted of second-degree murder, an Ecuadoran man convicted of possession of five kilograms of cocaine, and a Filipino man convicted of sexual offenses.\n\n\"These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets,\" Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary of the department, said in a statement. \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.\"\n\nWhat other times has the Guard been deployed to LA?\n\nThe National Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles multiple times in response to civil disorder and natural disasters. In previous years, the National Guard was sent at the request of state and local officials.\n\nIn June 2020, USA TODAY reported that Trump had considered invoking the Insurrection Act over protests in response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a former Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck on a street corner in May 2020. Protesters clashed with police across the country, including in Los Angeles, which prompted then-Mayor Eric Garcetti to ask Newsom for members of the Guard to be sent to the city.\n\nThe last time the Insurrection Act was invoked was in 1992 by former President George H.W. Bush, when the acquittal of the Los Angeles Police Department officers who beat Rodney King sparked the Los Angeles riots. Thousands of members of the Guard, the U.S. Army, and the Marine Corps were sent in response to the riots, which left more than 60 people dead and 2,300 injured, according to the Bill of Rights Institute.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDemocrat: Trump deploying Guard to invoke martial law\n\nSen. Chris Murphy accused Trump on Sunday of unnecessarily deploying the National Guard in California to escalate the conflict between protesters and ICE agents so he can eventually invoke the Insurrection Act and impose martial law in the United States.\n\nMurphy, a frequent and outspoken critic of Trump, said in a video posted on X that the crisis in California “is of Donald Trump's making.”\n\n“Any time a protest turns violent, that's unacceptable,” said Murphy, D-Conn. “But California has made it clear that between local and state authorities, they have the means to be able to keep the peace. They don't need Donald Trump. They don't need the National Guard.”\n\nMurphy said Trump decided to send in the Guard over the objections of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, “not to solve a problem, but to create a problem, because Donald Trump has always wanted to create an excuse to impose martial law, to invoke the Insurrection Act.”\n\nMurphy accused Trump of undergoing a comprehensive campaign since he was sworn in to try to undermine the rule of law in the United States to consolidate his own power and authority.\n\nOriginally enacted in 1792, the Insurrection Act grants the president the authority to deploy the U.S. military domestically and use it against Americans under certain conditions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law.\n\nTrump calls California Gov. Newsom 'incompetent'\n\nTrump called Newsom “incompetent,” based on cost overruns for a high-speed rail program, and said either state and local authorities would quell the violence or he would.\n\n\"You have an incompetent governor,\" Trump said. “I did call him the other night, I said, 'Look take care of this, otherwise I’m sending in the troops.'\"\n\nTrump also said state and local officials could face federal charges if they stand in the way of deportations. “If officials stand in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face federal charges,” Trump said.\n\nWhite House warns of 'zero tolerance'\n\n\"These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED,\" Trump said in a social media post Sunday. Trump and administration officials have attacked Newsom, Bass and other Democrats for failing to quell the disturbances. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump signed a memo a day earlier deploying the Guardsmen “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.”\n\n“The Trump administration has a zero tolerance policy for criminal behavior and violence, especially when that violence is aimed at law enforcement officers trying to do their jobs,” she said in a statement.\n\nHegseth said the Pentagon was prepared to mobilize active-duty troops \"if violence continues\" and that Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were \"on high alert.\"\n\nProtests came after ICE sweep\n\nOn Saturday, a large protest erupted in the city of Paramount in Los Angeles County, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It came as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted enforcement operations in the area.\n\nMore demonstrations followed, and some protesters assaulted ICE officers, slashed tires, and defaced buildings, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which claimed it took LAPD officers two hours to respond. Police sometimes countered the unrest by firing tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang concussion rounds toward gathering crowds.\n\n\"The violent targeting of law enforcement in Los Angeles by lawless rioters is despicable and Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom must call for it to end,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. \"The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/12/donald-trump-washington-dc-national-guard-troops/85635442007/", "title": "National Guard deployed to DC under Trump orders to combat crime", "text": "Members of the Washington, D.C., National Guard have reported for duty across the nation's capital on Aug. 12 under President Donald Trump's orders to fight crime and reduce homelessness in the city.\n\nAmong those deployed were members of the Guard's 273rd Military Police Company, whose commanders shared images on social media of armored Humvees parked next to the Washington Monument. Trump ordered 800 members of the guard into service, though not all have yet been deployed.\n\nTrump's decision to deploy the military drew sharp condemnation from Democrats across the country, who said the move raises civil-liberties concerns at a time when crime in D.C. is dropping.\n\n\"We're taking our capital back,\" Trump said on Aug. 11. \"We're taking it back.\"\n\nBecause D.C. falls under federal control, the president has the authority to call up the National Guard, and he also ordered that the city's Metropolitan Police Department be brought under Justice Department management. Mayor Muriel Bowser sought to reassure residents, saying that while violent crime remains a problem in the city, the national guard deployment was unnecessary.\n\n\"Violent crime in DC is at its lowest level in 30 years. We had an unacceptable spike in 2023, so we changed our laws and strategies,\" she said at a televised community meeting on August 12. \"Now, crime levels are not only down from 2023, but from before the pandemic. Our tactics are working, and we aren’t taking our foot off the gas.\"\n\n'Physical presence' on DC streets\n\nBowser said Trump called up the guard for non-law enforcement purposes, indicating they would work in a support role to assist law enforcement officers. White House officials said there would be anywhere from 100 to 200 troops supporting law enforcement at any given time, primarily providing administrative and logistical support, along with a \"physical presence\" on the streets.\n\n\"We will continue to watch for that,\" Bowser said.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said it would take time for all 800 guard members to move into position across the city.\n\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming weeks,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at an Aug. 12 news conference. \"They will be strong. They will be tough.\"\n\nAdvocates: Tougher enforcement does nothing to solve homelessness\n\nAdvocates for homeless people worried that the president's decision to send in troops would make life even harder for the roughly 900 people living on the city's streets.\n\n\"We're going to be removing homeless encampments from beautiful parks, which now, a lot of people can't walk on,” Trump told reporters on Aug. 11, adding that his administration is getting \"rid of the people from underpasses and public spaces from all over the city.\"\n\nIn a statement, the National Homelessness Law Center said tougher enforcement does nothing to solve homelessness.\n\n\"Arresting or ticketing people for sleeping outside makes homelessness worse, wastes taxpayer money, and simply does not work,\" spokesman Jesse Rabinowitz said. \"The solution to homelessness is housing and supports, not handcuffs and jails.\"\n\nLongtime DC mayor answers questions from city residents\n\nBowser, the city's leader since 2015, held a virtual sit-down with city residents on Aug. 12 to answer questions and assuage fears. Among comments from residents were concerns that the National Guard will do nothing to stop the influx of guns from nearby states into the city and fears that troops roaming the streets will scare older adults and teenagers into staying inside.\n\nThe three-term mayor stood by previous statements that the Metropolitan Police Department has overseen an unprecedented reduction in violent crime and hopes her administration can spin Trump's deployment of the guardsmen into a positive for the city, considering the department is understaffed by several hundred officers.\n\n\"Just imagine if we had the number of MPD officers that we should have, if we were at 3,800 instead of 3,100,\" Bowser said. Police officials are now approaching their deployment strategy to see \"how the additional federal police officers can help in some areas.\"\n\nKevin Donahue, Bowser’s city administrator, said D.C. would aim to keep the guardsmen near national monuments where people are accustomed to seeing armed forces and would try to have Metro police present wherever the troops are deployed to give residents a more familiar face.\n\nStaff said the largest part of the surge, potentially hundreds of federal troops, would happen overnight when many residents are indoors.\n\n'Every American should be deeply concerned'\n\nCharles Allen, a District council member overseeing the neighbors closest to the Capitol, called the deployment \"extreme, outrageous, and dangerous.\"\n\n\"National Guard soldiers are trained for warfare & natural disasters, not for community policing,\" Allen said in a lengthy thread on social media. \"Every American should be deeply concerned with what they’re witnessing today.\"\n\nEleanor Holmes Norton, the city's longtime non-voting representative in Congress, said Trump based his federal takeover on a \"fiction he's pushed since the campaign trail.\"\n\n\"DC has not been 'overtaken by violent gangs' as he said yesterday,\" Holmes Norton said. \"The opposite is true: Crime is the lowest it's been in 30 years.\"\n\nResidents oppose National Guard deployment\n\nEarlier on Aug. 12, The New York Times reported that members of the National Guard were seen in various areas across D.C., including near the Washington Monument. The troops appeared on the streets and in their military vehicles.\n\nIn Anacostia, a historic and predominantly Black neighborhood in southeast D.C., residents told the Times that they opposed Trump’s decision to deploy the military and to place local police under federal control.\n\n\"I think it’s very horrible,” Kyvin Battle, 57, told the newspaper. \"Because a lot of us who are innocent are going to get caught in the middle of all this.\"\n\nResidents noted that the crime levels in the city did not justify the federalization of the city's police force, according to the Times and Reuters. Rodney Miller, who has lived in the D.C. area for 50 years, told Reuters that he questioned the need for National Guard troops given lower crime levels now.\n\nThough many residents have expressed disapproval, some have shown support for the president’s decision. While out on a walk with her child on Aug. 12, Rebecca Harkey told Reuters that crime had made her consider leaving the capital and that it was \"very much an active fear\" in her life.\n\nLocal leaders, civil rights activists denounce police takeover\n\nTrump has previously singled out majority Democratic cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, and D.C. — all cities with large Black populations — while speaking about rising crime in urban areas. In response to the president's claims and threats to deploy the military, local leaders have pointed to statistics showing a decline in crime in their cities over recent years.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said on Aug. 11 that homicides dropped 30% in the past two years and shootings were down 40% in the past year alone.\n\n\"If President Trump wants to help make Chicago safer, he can start by releasing the funds for anti-violence programs that have been critical to our work to drive down crime and violence,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\nIn a joint statement on Aug. 11, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, and other local elected leaders said they \"stand in strong opposition to the President's latest power grab, which is based on pure lies about our communities.\"\n\n\"As leaders in Baltimore and the state of Maryland, we Baltimore, like D.C., is seeing real public safety progress - with homicides down 40% since 2021 - even as the Trump administration has slashed funding for the programs that have brought crime to record lows,\" according to the statement.\n\nCivil rights leaders also condemned the deployment and police takeover, calling it \"unprecedented,\" and warned that there would be long-term repercussions to First Amendment rights. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who founded the National Action Network, said in a statement that “the people of Washington, D.C. ‒ especially those living on the streets, who need the most care ‒ will suffer, alongside the core principles of our Democracy.”\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/11/trump-national-guard-deployment-us-cities-dc/85610923007/", "title": "Trump puts other US cities on notice as he sends National Guard to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump said he might expand his crackdown on crime in the nation's capital to other major U.S. cities as he announced plans to send 800 National Guard troops into Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump singled out New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Oakland, California during a Monday, Aug. 11, news conference as potential future targets in what would be a drastic escalation of federal presence on the streets of American cities.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this. This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on his plans for other cities. But one of the two executive actions he signed Aug. 11 directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate with governors of states and \"authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\"\n\n\"We're going to take back our capital,\" Trump said. \"And then we'll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we're doing.\"\n\nTrump warns cities to 'learn their lesson'\n\nEach of the cities that Trump mentioned are led by Democratic mayors in states with Democratic governors, who could be less likely to request the Trump administration's intervention than Republican governors who are political allies of the president.\n\n\"Other cities are hopefully watching this.... And maybe they’ll self-clean up,\" Trump said, adding they could be targeted if \"they don't learn their lesson\" and study his administration's moves in Washington. He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\"\n\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington’s police department. The move, authorized by federal law as part of the District of Columbia's unique status as a federal enclave, is not an option for Trump elsewhere.\n\nSecretary of Army Daniel Driscoll is set to lead the National Guard’s operation in Washington.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is also prepared to bring in additional National Guard units and other specialized units if needed. \"They will be strong. They will be tough. And they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\" Hegseth said.\n\n\"This is nothing new for DOD,\" he added, pointing to Trump’s deployment of military troops at the United States-Mexico border to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations from increased immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\n\nMayors push back at Trump's threat\n\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents about 1,400 mayors, responded to Trump's actions and threats by touting a \"nationwide success story\" of plummeting crime rates.\n\n\"Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, president of the mayors' conference, said in a statement. \"America’s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results.\"\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, in response to Trump singling out his city, said \"Baltimore is the safest it's been in over 50 years,\" adding that homicides are down about 28% in 2025.\n\n\"We still have real work to do to build on this progress,\" Scott said in a statement, \"but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore, with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.\"\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman of USA TODAY\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/12/trump-announces-national-guard-deploying-to-memphis/86110169007/", "title": "Trump says National Guard troops heading to Memphis to fight crime", "text": "\"We're going to Memphis,\" Trump announced.\n\nMemphis had the country's highest murder rate in 2024.\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ President Donald Trump said he's deploying the National Guard to Memphis, choosing a city in a Republican-controlled state where the governor welcomes the intervention as the next target in his crime crackdown.\n\n\"We're going to Memphis,\" Trump said Sept. 12 on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" calling Memphis \"deeply troubled\" and adding that Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican ally of Trump, and the city's Democratic Mayor Paul Young are both \"happy\" about the plans. \"We're going to fix that, just like we fixed Washington.\"\n\nMemphis, which has long struggled with crime, had the highest rates of murder and other violent crime of any large city in the country in 2024, according to a USA TODAY analysis of FBI data from 30 cities with more than 500,000 residents. Memphis had 40.6 homicides per 100,000 people compared to a rate of 25.5 per 100,000 in the nation's capital, which ranked fifth.\n\nYoung said he did notrequest the National Guard, but he had been in communication with federal officials seeking additional aid to supplement local crime-fighting efforts.\n\n\"I do not think it’s the way to drive down crime. However, that decision has been made,\" Young said during a news conference.\n\n'Not the way to drive down crime': Memphis mayor does 'not support' National Guard deployment but hopes to work with them\n\nMemphis Mayor: No 'authority to stop' troops\n\nFor weeks, Trump has discussed plans to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, but the proposal has drawn fierce resistance from the state's Democratic governor, J.B. Pritzker. Citing a desire for cooperation from local and state leaders, Trump last week floated New Orleans ‒ which, like Memphis, is in a Republican-led state ‒ as a potential target before landing on Memphis.\n\n\"I would have preferred going to Chicago,\" Trump said.\n\nWhen asked if he was happy about troops coming to Memphis, Young said it was an \"overstatement.\" He added that he was focused on additional resources, including getting FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) officers to Memphis.\n\n\"Those are the things that I believe will truly help us be able to support law enforcement and reduce violent crime. I do not support the National Guard,\" Young said. \"However, they are (the governor's) call. It's not the mayor's call. The mayor doesn't have...an authority to stop them.\n\n\"And so my goal is to make sure that as they come that I have an opportunity to work with them, to strategize on how they engage in this community,\" Young said.\n\nTennessee governor 'grateful' for Trump's focus on Memphis\n\nTrump did not say how many National Guard troops he plans to deploy to Memphis, the second-largest city in Tennessee behind Nashville. \"We'll bring in the military, too, if we need it,\" he said.\n\nLee, in a statement, welcomed the Guard's deployment, saying he's been in \"constant communication\" with the Trump administration for months about a plan to combat crime in Memphis.\n\nHe said the operation will include the Tennessee National Guard, FBI and other law enforcement agencies working with state and local agencies. The goal is to complement an FBI initiative called \"Operation Viper,\" which is aimed at reducing crime in Memphis.\n\n“I’m grateful for the President’s unwavering support and commitment to providing every resource necessary to serve Memphians, and I look forward to working with local officials and law enforcement to continue delivering results,\" Lee said. \"As one of America’s world-class cities, Memphis remains on a path to greatness, and we are not going to let anything hold them back,\" he said.\n\nLee's consent will ease the deployments and will likely permit other states to send National Guard troops in state-controlled status, permitting them to directly assist in law enforcement.\n\nYoung recognized Lee's comments and said some of the fear he has is also the fear of the community.\n\nYoung said there are many unknowns.\n\n\"My team and I will be discussing those questions with the governor and the federal government. When will they come? How many people are going to come? How long will they be here? What are they going to wear? Where are they going to be, geographically in the city, what assignments will they have?\" Young said. \"Those are all questions that we have and that we are going to work through together as a community.\"\n\nStanding behind Young was Congressman Steve Cohen, Tennessee's lone Democratic congressman who represents Memphis, along with Memphis Police Department Chief Cerelyn \"C.J.\" Davis, Memphis Tourism President and CEO Kevin Kane, and newly elected Shelby County Commission Chairwoman Shante K Avant. They all took exception with Trump's characterization of Memphis.\n\n“Memphis is not ‘a troubled city,’ as President Trump has said,\" Cohen said in a statement. \"We have a crime problem.\" He blamed the city's crime rate on the effects of slavery, segregation and under-investment.\n\n“In the short run, the Guard can help the police in a supportive role,\" Cohen added. \"In the long run, Memphis needs federal dollars invested in proven programs.\"\n\nTrump is one month into his crime crackdown in Washington, DC, which has involved deploying more than 2,200 National Guard troops to patrol the streets. But unlike other American cities, DC's status as a federal enclave gives Trump special authority to deploy National Guard troops. In the states, governors traditionally oversee mobilizations.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Aug. 11 directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"coordinate with state governors\" to determine whether National Guard troops are needed in their communities.\n\nTrump recounts hearing from FedEx board member\n\nTrump recounted hearing from a board member of FedEx, which is based in Memphis, about the city's crime problem.\n\n\"He said, 'When I walk one block from my hotel ‒ they won't allow me to do it. They put me in an armored vehicle with bulletproof glass to take me one block.' He said it's so terrible,\" Trump said, without identifying the individual.\n\nTrump calls DC crime crackdown successful\n\nTrump has hailed his crime crackdown in Washington, DC, as a wild success, and even DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has agreed to an increased federal presence that has helped reduce the number of homicides, carjackings and gun crimes.\n\nYet, Bowser has also said the federal intervention has led to a \"break in trust\" between the community and law enforcement.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has exaggerated the scale of the turnaround, saying that the district now has \"literally no crime\" and describing a city where people were too scared to eat at restaurants before his takeover. When Trump announced his takeover, violent crime was already down in DC by 26% from 2024, according to the Metropolitan Police Department..\n\nThe Trump administration has faced lawsuits over the National Guard deployment in Washington as well as from California Gov.

A demonstration in Austin, Texas, began peacefully before devolving into violent clashes between police and demonstrators, ending with 13 arrests and multiple injuries to law enforcement. In St. Louis, dozens of protesters rallied peacefully on an overpass, calling for a stop to immigration raids.\n\nAmericans split over Trump's military deployment in LA protests: poll\n\nAmericans are divided on Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in reaction to protests over his administration's immigration enforcement, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll has found.\n\nSome 48% of respondents agreed with a statement that the president should \"deploy the military to bring order to the streets\" when protests turn violent, while 41% disagreed. Republicans overwhelmingly backed the idea of calling in troops while Democrats were firmly opposed.\n\nMeanwhile, just 35% of respondents said they approved of Trump's response to the protests in Los Angeles. Some 50% of people in the poll said they disapproved of Trump's response.\n\n– Reuters\n\nLatino groups blast forced removal of US senator from Noem event\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and other national Latino organizations condemned the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday. LULAC, which is the oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization in the United States, has demanded an immediate investigation into the incident.\n\nVideos showed Padilla being forced to the ground and handcuffed after trying to ask a question during the news conference, where Noem was discussing the protests over federal immigration raids. In a video statement released Thursday night, Padilla said he had been escorted to the news conference by a National Guardsman and an FBI agent after waiting for another scheduled briefing.\n\n\"Now, I'm OK for people who are wondering how I'm doing,\" Padilla, who is from California, added. \"But the big lesson here is if they can do that to me ... what are they doing to a lot of the folks that are out there when the cameras are not on?\"\n\nIn a statement on X, Noem said she met with Padilla for 15 minutes after his removal from the news conference and added that the pair exchanged phone numbers and intend to speak further. \"I wish he would’ve acted that way in the beginning rather than creating a scene,\" she said.\n\nWalmart heiress promotes anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests in ad\n\nBillionaire Walmart heiress Christy Walton took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times urging people to join nationwide protests against the Trump administration on Saturday, June 14, drawing swift condemnation from Trump supporters.\n\nThe advertisement, which ran on Sunday, encourages readers to take to the streets as part of the some 2,000 demonstrations planned across the country. The “No Kings Day” protests are expected to be the largest demonstrations against Trump since he took office, and also coincide with Trump’s military parade in Washington.\n\nWalmart sought to distance itself from the advertisement placed by one of the richest women in America. “The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnrest at Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, draws law enforcement response\n\nAn immigration detention facility in New Jersey, where at least two officials were arrested last month, became the site of unrest on Thursday, June 12, triggering a large law enforcement response.\n\nSeveral immigration rights groups said detainees protested over insufficient food and other poor conditions at Delaney Hall, the first immigrant detention center to open during President Donald Trump's second term. Regarding the law enforcement response, groups said there were reports of agents deploying tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nOfficials have not provided details about the incident. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a critic of the facility who was arrested in front of it on May 9, said in a statement that he is concerned about reports of what has happened at the Delaney Hall “from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.”\n\n“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights,” he said on X. “We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.\"\n\n10 arrested in Portland as protests spread nationwide\n\nA week after protests began in Los Angeles, more anti-ICE demonstrations have sprung up in cities nationwide in solidarity with LA protesters. Protests have been reported in San Francisco, New York, Washington, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and many more.\n\nIn Portland, authorities said overnight that 10 people were arrested for their alleged behavior during a protest outside an ICE facility the evening of June 12. The 10 arrested ranged in ages from 19 to 33 and were booked on charges that included arson, disorderly conduct and assault on an officer.\n\nTwo officers had minor injuries, the Portland Police Bureau said.\n\nWhat have courts said about federalization of the National Guard?\n\nIn its order temporarily allowing Trump to maintain his control over the National Guard, the appeals court did not issue a final ruling but delivered what's called an \"administrative stay.\" It gave the appeals judges time to consider Trump's request to block Breyer's order. The appeals court was made up of a panel of three judges, two of which were appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden.\n\nA hearing was scheduled for the appeals court on Tuesday, June 17 at noon.\n\nBreyer, the federal judge who ruled Trump's deployment of the Guard was unlawful, issued just hours before the appeals court ruling a 36-page decision in which he said the president's actions were illegal and a violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. Breyer was appointed in 1997 by former Democratic President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nBreyer wrote he was \"troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,\" responding to the Trump administration's justification for sending in the National Guard.\n\n\"(T)here can be no debate that most protesters demonstrated peacefully,\" the judge said.\n\nCurfew for parts of downtown Los Angeles\n\nFollowing days of protests in Los Angeles, which were mostly confined to parts of the city's downtown area, a partial curfew remained in effect for the third consecutive night. The curfew, lasting from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. PT for pockets of downtown Los Angeles, was implemented on Tuesday.\n\n“My hope is after continuing it a few more days, that people will get the message that we are serious,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a Thursday news conference.\n\nShortly before the curfew went into effect on Thursday night, the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division reported people in a crowd throwing bricks, concrete, and commercial-grade fireworks.\n\n\"Less lethal munitions have been authorized,\" LAPD said in a post on X at about 7:55 p.m. local time.\n\nPlanned 'No Kings' protests for June 14 grow\n\n\"No Kings\" Day organizers say it is more important than ever to have a \"national day of peaceful protest\" on June 14, following the decision by Trump to send 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\n\"I think we will see the largest peaceful single day protests that this country has seen certainly since the first Trump term,\" said Indivisible cofounder Ezra Levin, one of the organizers.\n\nNow, about 2,000 protests and rallies named \"No Kings\" Day are planned to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, nearly double that of the April 5 \"Hands Off\" protest that saw millions of Americans turn out in big and small cities nationwide. Organizers expect millions of Americans to turn out across the country on June 14.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/05/29/law-officers-swarm-tallahassee-in-illegal-immigration-crackdown/83919589007/", "title": "Law officers swarm Tallahassee in illegal immigration crackdown ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary More than 100 people were detained in Tallahassee during immigration raids at construction sites.\n\nThose detained reported being from Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Honduras, among other countries.\n\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene with workers panicking and some attempting to flee.\n\nDozens of law enforcement officers and agents, some wearing masks and camouflage uniforms, conducted multiple anti-illegal immigration raids in Tallahassee Thursday morning, ultimately taking over 100 people into custody.\n\nBy midday on May 29, at least 34 people had been detained at one student apartment construction site near CollegeTown. Later in the day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on social media that authorities had \"arrested more than 100 illegal aliens, some of which were previously deported and others with criminal backgrounds,\" calling it \"a targeted enforcement operation.\"\n\nThe raids come as Florida appeals a federal judge's decision to temporarily block a new law (SB 4-C) creating state crimes for undocumented immigrants entering or re-entering Florida. It’s likely also the largest single illegal immigration sweep in Florida since Gov. Ron DeSantis agreed to join in on President Donald Trump’s aggressive mass deportation agenda.\n\nLaw officers were seen taking people into custody on the construction site of \"a seven-story mixed-use development called Perla at the Enclave,\" according to its website. Its representatives could not be immediately reached by phone and a Zimmer Development manager on site refused to speak with reporters.\n\nAgencies involved include the Florida Highway Patrol and Department of Homeland Security Investigations. Those apprehended and being held in a bus told reporters through the windows they were from Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\nDHS said others were from Guatemala, El Salvador and Colombia. Near the bus, two women were seen cuffed and put in the back of a Highway Patrol cruiser.\n\nA man named Martin who was in the bus said there were about 15 others with him by that point. They had been restrained with their wrists behind their backs, he said. On what was becoming a hot Tallahassee summer day, water was inside the bus, they said, but no cups.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier told the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida that \"Homeland Security Investigations served multiple search warrants as part of an ongoing investigation in the Tallahassee region. There is no additional information available at this time.”\n\nSpokespersons with both the Tallahassee Police Department and Leon County Sheriff's Office said they were not involved in the operation.\n\nAfter initially saying that detainees would not be coming to the Leon County Detention Center, LCSO spokesperson Shonda Knight said she was notified that a \"few\" who have criminal charges will be brought to the jail under an ICE hold. Presumably other detainees will be taking to ICE holding facilities in Baker or Walton counties.\n\n“I’ll have to defer questions and answers to FHP and HSI,\" TPD spokesperson Damon Miller, when asked about the activity.\n\nConstruction workers, who were excused from the construction site after the raid, told the USA TODAY NETWORK other construction sites also were shut down. The ICE spokesperson declined to comment on possible other raids.\n\n\"Hedrick Brothers Construction fully complies with all regulatory standards, including all E-Verify employment verification requirements,\" said a spokesperson for another Tallahassee job site that was raided. \"Furthermore, we require all independent subcontractors to follow the same legal standards, as outlined in our contractual agreements with their companies. Hedrick Brothers Construction will fully cooperate with all elements of the investigation.\"\n\n'It’s just crazy how they’re doing this,' one man said\n\nFernando Sanchez said he immediately knew what was happening. Within minutes, law enforcement had surrounded the job site on the corner of Gaines and Mosley streets.\n\nPeople were panicking, he explained, and some of his coworkers were trying to run, but there was nowhere to go.\n\n“I wasn’t panicking, but I felt really bad for my coworkers who are just trying to make a living,” Sanchez said. Officers were yelling at Sanchez to come over to them but he said he told them to show him a warrant before he followed orders.\n\nOfficers were checking every individual’s identifications and permits before releasing or detaining them. If any one had a warrant out for their arrest, Sanchez said he believes they all got taken away.\n\nMichael Martinez, a worker from a different job site nearby, said agents came and raided his construction site about an hour earlier. People were fleeing and only a few got caught.\n\n“It’s just crazy how they’re doing this,” Martinez said.\n\nOther law enforcement spotted on site wore garb that said Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Florida Department of Law Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement.\n\nStill another construction worker told a reporter at least five companies had workers on the building site. People who were making it through identification checks were coming out and immediately calling loved ones.\n\nNeighbor in nearby building: 'It was just very disturbing' to watch\n\nCaity Salter, a recent Florida State graduate, said she was woken up by a phone call from a friend who lives in the same complex but closer to the construction saying that there was a large police presence and a van that read \"mobile command unit.\"\n\n\"I walked out to the balcony in my building, it's pretty far away (from the construction) but I could see the van and just a ton of cops by the construction area,\" Salter said.\n\nSalter eventually woke up her roommate and the two headed down where they stood behind a fence with other FSU students in the building watching the scene unfold.\n\n\"We just saw a lot of Hispanic construction workers, some with ... zip-tie handcuffs.\" Salter said that she and her roommate walked to another part of the construction site and saw \"a big line (of people) and more cops.\"\n\n\"Some of the people, the construction workers, (were in) zip ties and they were in a line ... and it was just very disturbing to see that,\" she added. She said that she also saw around 10 people dressed in camouflage gear.\n\nLaw enforcement on Willis Road\n\nAlso May 29, law enforcement descended on a gated home on Willis Road off north Meridian Road. The home has the same address as a business listed as Nino’s Carpentry Shop.\n\nKnight said what is unfolding there is an “active and fluid” investigation. LCSO deputies were on the scene along with agents from FDLE and HSI.\n\nAgents could be seen going inside and outside the home. At one point, an agent brought a filing cabinet out to a large truck. The sound of what may have been a saw could be heard coming from the truck. A computer was also brought to the truck.\n\nKnight said the operation was not an immigration enforcement issue, but declined to comment if the raid was linked to people associated with earlier immigration raids.\n\nJim Rosica is news director of the Tallahassee Democrat, a member of the USA TODAY Network – Florida.

Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox.\n\nQuestion: What prompted you to change your mind about having the SAG Awards a month after the fires?\n\nAnswer: I realized these awards shows are a huge part of Los Angeles' economy, employing hundreds, if not thousands, of gig workers: drivers, hair and makeup artists, musicians. It's actually paramount we have them so these people can work. At first, it felt superfluous to have an awards show. Then I thought, I know so many people who lost homes in the fire. All they're begging for is a night of normalcy and funny laughs. I felt like we could give them both.\n\nYou were the first SAG Awards host ever in 2018. Has your approach to hosting changed this time because of the fires or political climate?\n\nNot at all. I've put zero effort into changing my comedy. My style of comedy is not roasting or attacking. If I'm going to come at somebody, it's going to be me. I certainly will acknowledge the first responders to celebrate them and, at the minimum, give thanks for saving our city. (As for politics) Not on my watch. I don't know who that benefits.\n\nHave you been surprised that more movie studios and production companies have not pledged to keep projects in Los Angeles after the devastation?\n\nI'm an optimist, so I see it coming. The second I felt I had leverage in my career, years ago, I said I wouldn't take work outside of Los Angeles. I have a finite amount of time with my children in the house. I want to come home every night. And the trickle-down effect is that the crew members can go home to their families, and the bagel store next to the studio stays open because we're there every morning. Figuring out who we need to beg for tax incentives is my priority to create work here and keep people in Los Angeles.\n\nYour hit rom-com with Adam Brody, \"Nobody Wants This,\" is a love letter to Los Angeles. When do you start work on Season 2, and what can we expect?\n\nWe start the first week of March. We're scouting all over Los Angeles. Hopefully, it will be another love letter, showing the places not affected by the fires. I loved the Season 1 ending so much because it was a bit unwrapped. The expressed mandate from the writers' room for this season is, \"Let's not make the show something crazy.\" People have enjoyed this grounded rom-com, and these people. Let's give them more of what they want.\n\nHow did you earn your SAG union card as a young actress growing up in Michigan?\n\nIt was a commercial for a Detroit neuroscience institute that helped people with brain injuries. I played a girl who had been in a roller skating accident and hit her head. Obviously, it was an outstanding performance because it got me my SAG card.\n\nExplain your blink-and-you-miss-it cameo in that\"A Man on the Inside\" classroom scene for Ted Danson, your \"The Good Place\" co-star.\n\nWe wanted to re-create the shot from the opening of \"The Good Place,\" where the camera comes over my back and head, and you see, \"Everything is fine!\" And I said, \"What if I wore the sweater from 'The Good Place' final episode?\" which I had kept from the set. It's a fun Easter egg.\n\nQuestion for Anna: Why do fans have to wait until November 2027 for Disney to release \"Frozen III\"?\n\nTell me about it. It's not my choice. I want to get back in that recording booth l before I'm using a walker. But Disney took their sweet time from \"Frozen\" (2013) to writing \"Frozen 2\" (2019) because they didn't want it to just be \"Episode 2.\" They wanted it to mean something. That's one thing I love about working on this project: the rigor with which the storyline is built. It's like nothing I've ever seen. I think that effort is why the movies have succeeded.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/01/13/la-fires-celebrity-updates-homes-donations/77666386007/", "title": "LA fires: Meghan Markle postpones show, Grammys to proceed", "text": "The battle against the destructive wildfires in Southern California continued on Wednesday as more celebrities spoke out about the damage and announced plans to lend a hand.\n\nWinds were weaker than predicted Tuesday, and firefighting crews made progress containing the deadly blazes.

But when the EGOT winner heard that she would receive a lifetime achievement award at the 2025 Golden Globes, she reacted in a manner that was different from past honors.\n\n\"This is a first award I was told that I won that made me cry,\" Davis, 59, told USA TODAY before receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award for achievement in entertainment at Friday night's inaugural Golden Gala. \"Little Viola showed up who just never could imagine that she could evolve into this life, into this career. I just feel incredibly grateful today.\"\n\nJoin our Watch Party! Sign up to receive USA TODAY's movie and TV recommendations right in your inbox.\n\nThe Golden Globes presented Viola with her honorary statuette at the gala. The event also recognized Ted Danson, who received the Carol Burnett Award, given to person who's made outstanding contributions to television on or off screen. It was created in 2019 and named after the comedy icon.\n\nFriday night's Golden Gala was held at the Beverly Hilton, where Sunday's awards show will take place (CBS, 8 p.m. EST/5 PST, and streaming live for Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers). Burnett and a number of other stars were in attendance.\n\nTed Danson credits his long career to the role that started it all\n\nThe night's most heartwarming moment came at the beginning of Danson's acceptance speech, when he professed his love for Burnett and she shouted, \"I love you!\" back to him from the crowd. Danson, 77, thanked his managers, agents and his longtime publicist Annett Wolf, along with casts and crews he's worked with over the years. Many of his current colleagues on Netflix's \"A Man on the Inside\" were in attendance. Steve Guttenberg, who starred with Danson in the movies \"Three Men and a Baby\" and \"Three Men and a Little Lady,\" was also there to support the actor.\n\n\"He's just a great guy and he is a great actor,\" Guttenberg said. \"He's funny, he's caring. He cares about the environment, cares about the world, cares about people.\"\n\nDanson also thanked his wife, Oscar-winning actress Mary Steenburgen, who presented him with the award. The actor's career took off with the role of Boston bartender Sam Malone on TV's \"Cheers.\" He said that he probably wouldn't have met his wife had it not been for that role.\n\n\"For all the amazing writers that I've been blessed to work with, starting with the creators of 'Cheers,' I wouldn't be standing here (without the show),\" he said, naming the show's writers and co-creators Glen Charles and Les Charles. \"Literally everything I have in life acting-wise comes from you all.\"\n\nViola Davis gives a rousing, unscripted acceptance speech\n\nFellow Academy Award and Golden Globe winner Meryl Streep presented Davis with her lifetime achievement award. The two met after being cast in 2008's \"Doubt.\" Davis said that Streep's involvement added \"to the magic\" of the honor.\n\nBut when Davis took the stage, she invoked magic of her own. The actress was the only speaker at the event who didn't use a teleprompter. She took the audience on a 16-minute journey that covered her life, from growing up in a dysfunctional home to the curiosity that fueled her Hollywood stardom.\n\n\"I was so poor,\" she said. The actress was born in South Carolina but raised in Central Falls, Rhode Island. \"Growing up in a house with alcoholism and rage, infested with rats everywhere, toilets that never worked.\"\n\nDavis said as a child she \"was a bedwetter every single day\" and went to school \"with the same clothes that were just soaked with urine. My life just didn't make sense.\"\n\n\"But what I had was magic,\" she added. \"I could teleport, I can take myself out of this worthless world and relieve myself of it at times. I could go to a place where I can belly laugh, where I can have fun. And the biggest magic was I could see people.\"\n\nDavis credits her ability to \"see people\" with being able to take on \"characters that are dead, that nobody cares about, no one loves.\" She brought those characters back to life using memories from throughout her life.\n\nDavis won an Oscar and a Tony for her role of Rose Maxson in \"Fences.\" She acknowledged during her speech that she sometimes took roles solely for money. Davis had seen too much death and despair to believe there was \"nobility in poverty\" and that as a \"dark-skinned black woman with a wide nose and big lips\" the roles being offered were simply the only ones available.\n\nDavis concluded her acceptance by saying the only two people you owe anything to are your 6-year-old self and your 80-year-old self.\n\n\"Little Viola is squealing,\" she said of her younger self. \"And what she's whispering is, 'I told you I was a magician.' \"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/04"}]}

Channel 10 News reported that the air force stepped up its aerial strikes while the navy fired from the sea.\n\nThe late-night broadcasts showed northern Gaza lit up by flares from Israeli forces.\n\nShortly before the operation, the Defense Forces instructed Israeli residents in the south near the Gaza border to remain in their homes.\n\nThe goal of the operation is to target Hamas infrastructure, including tunnels, storage facilities, launching pads and any structures the group uses to launch its rockets, Lt. Libby Weiss, a Defense Forces spokeswoman told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We have a substantial amount of forces, though I can't specify numbers,\" Weiss said. \"These include armored forces, infantry, artillery and aerial and naval support. This is not a time-bound operation. It's a goal-bound operation.\"\n\nShe said civilians are not the target, stressing that Israeli forces will continue to take measures to minimize civilian casualties.\n\nThousands of Israeli soldiers had massed on the border with Gaza in recent days, waiting for the order to go in. More may be coming.\n\nThe government has authorized the military to call up an additional 18,000 reserve soldiers, the Associated Press reported.\n\nA Hamas official told the Associated Press that heavy Israeli shelling was hitting eastern Gaza, near the border with Israel. He said all border areas are under fire, and tank shells hit every minute. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\n\nLate on Thursday, Reuters reported that while shelling was heavy along the easter border of the southern town of Rahah, there was no immediate sign that tanks were moving in.\n\nResidents told the Associated Press the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya came under heavy Israeli shelling. \"There is the sound of tank shells all the time,\" said Jamal Abu Samra, 42, a farmer in the area. He said his wife, six children, four brothers and their families were huddling on the ground floor of the family home.\n\n\"We don't have power since the afternoon so we are listing to the (battery-operated) radio to hear the news,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Israeli military sent text messages to residents urging them to leave the area. Abu Samra said he and his relatives decided to stay because they felt nowhere in Gaza is safe. \"It is better to stay home than move anywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe ground offensive is the first major Israeli incursion in Gaza in more than five years. Israeli strikes have hit more than 2,000 targets in Gaza, and Hamas launched nearly 1,500 rockets at Israel, according to the Israeli military.\n\nThe cross-border battles have killed more than 220 Palestinians and one Israeli.\n\nThe incursion followed a brief lull Thursday to allow Gaza residents to stock up on food and other supplies.\n\nTwo hours into that cease-fire early Thursday, Israelis near the border were forced back into bomb shelters after rockets were launched at them. After that, the five-hour truce held until its precise end, when Gaza militants began launching at least 40 rockets and mortar shells into Israeli towns and cities. Sirens sounded as far north as Herzilya in the center of Israel.\n\nIsrael responded by launching two airstrikes at Gaza, the Associated Press reported.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Egypt had pushed for a cease-fire to end the conflict that began July 8. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who governs the West Bank, after Egyptian officials met with representatives of Israel and Hamas in Cairo.\n\nIsrael had accepted Egypt's call this week to halt the fighting, but Hamas rejected it, saying it wanted more concessions that include easing a blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees, announced Thursday that it had discovered rockets hidden in a vacant Gaza school.\n\n\"UNRWA strongly condemns the group or groups responsible for placing the weapons in one of its installations,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a flagrant violation of the inviolability of its premises under international law,\" it said. The incident \"endangered civilians, including staff, and put at risk UNRWA's vital mission to assist and protect Palestine refugees in Gaza.\"\n\nAlso Thursday, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said the murder of a 16-year-old Arab resident of East Jerusalem was a terror attack, for which three Jews were indicted on murder charges.\n\nMuhammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped July 2, and his burned body was discovered in a Jerusalem forest a few hours later. His murder, after the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens in the West Bank, sparked widespread Arab rioting in East Jerusalem and throughout Israel and precipitated the current fighting.\n\nThe move to designate Abu Khdeir as a terror victim \"was made as a result of the indictment and the findings of the investigation, which point to the nationalist motive of his murder,\" the ministry said.\n\nA 29-year-old man and two 17-year-olds, who have not been named, were indicted in the murder. The Shin Bet security services said the suspects confessed to the crime, which they said was to avenge the murder of the three Israeli teens, who were kidnapped June 12. Israel blames Hamas for that crime. The teens were buried the day before Abu Khdeir was killed.\n\nThe designation as a terror victim entitles Abu Khdeir's family to financial benefits provided by Israel's National Insurance Institute. Although many Arab families in Israel receive such benefits because of terror attacks carried out by Palestinians, the government rarely designates crimes committed by Jews as a terror attack.\n\nAl-Helou reported from Gaza City, Dumalaon reported from Berlin.

For the latest news and updates on the conflict in Israel, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Friday, Oct. 13.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces called for the evacuation of all civilians in Gaza City early Friday, on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours.\n\nThe military warned civilians that the armed forces would be operating in the city in the following days. \"This evacuation is for your own safety,\" the Israeli military said in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians.\n\nThe broader order was delivered to the U.N., according to United Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, who called the order “impossible” without “devastating humanitarian consequences.”\n\n\"This is chaos, no one understands what to do,\" said Inas Hamdan, an officer at the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City while she grabbed whatever she could throw into her bags as the panicked shouts of her relatives could be heard around her. She said all the U.N. staff in Gaza City and northern Gaza had been told to evacuate south to Rafah.\n\nAlarmed civilians and aid workers, who were already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, were sent into chaos. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way one million people could evacuate that fast.\n\n“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.\n\nFarsakh said many medics were refusing to evacuate hospitals and abandoned patients, which included the elderly, children, and many wounded civilians.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately confirm the broader evacuation order but the alert could signal an imminent ground offensive. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with airstrikes and on Thursday an airstrike killed at least 45 people in a Gaza refugee camp Thursday, the territory's interior ministry said, potentially stoking global protests a former Hamas leader has called for that have provoked fears among travelers.\n\nMinistry spokesman Eyad Bozum told The Associated Press the late-afternoon airstrike hit the al-Shihab family house at the center of the densely populated Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza, adding that the death toll would probably rise. Dozens were wounded and the list of casualties shows more than half the dead were children.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Israeli bombardment has killed more than 1,500 people in Gaza. A White House spokesman said Thursday the U.S. death toll from the Hamas attacks rose to 27 and 14 remain missing.\n\n∎ After mobilizing 360,000 reservists, the Israeli military is preparing for a possible ground operation in Gaza but the political leadership has not yet decided on one, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told reporters.\n\n∎ About 423,000 people – more than 18% of Gaza’s population – have fled their homes, most of them packing into schools run by the United Nations.\n\n∎ Two Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank when Israeli settlers opened fire at a funeral for three Palestinians who had been killed in a settler rampage the day before, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.\n\nUS death toll rises US death toll rises; lawmaker says Egypt warned Israel before attack: Updates\n\nU.S. citizens will have access to charter flights out of Israel\n\nThe White House said Thursday it will arrange charter flights to Europe starting Friday. On Wednesday, the State Department raised its alert level for American travelers to Israel and the West Bank, urging them to reconsider their plans. Travel advisories already are in place urging increased caution for U.S. citizens traveling to Jordan and Turkey and advising them to reconsider travel to Egypt and Lebanon because of terrorism.\n\n\"Terrorists may attack with little or no warning,\" the agency warns.\n\nThe uncertainty follows a trip to Israel by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met Thursday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv in a show of support. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to arrive in Israel on Friday to discuss military aid.\n\nBlinken is continuing his trip with stops in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, seeking to prevent the conflict from escalating and pursue the release of hostages.\n\nIsrael says siege will continue until hostages are freed\n\nThe Israeli siege of Gaza has left its 2.3 million people desperate for food, fuel and medicine while hospitals get overwhelmed amid relentless bombing and lack of power. Those conditions won't improve until Hamas militants free the approximately 150 hostages captured in the weekend assault, Israel officials said. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza, and Egypt has enforced a blockade. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade, restricting the passage of people and goods in and out of the territory,\n\n“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.\n\nAids organizations are warning of a humanitarian crisis as resources become increasingly scarce, and what's available is hard to access because of airstrikes that have involved 6,000 munitions, according to the Israeli military.\n\n“We can’t flee because anywhere you go, you are bombed,” Khalil Abu Yahia said from a refugee camp in north Gaza. “You need a miracle to survive here.”\n\n$6 billion in unfrozen funds not released to Iran for now\n\nIran, long a financial and military supporter of Hamas but not directly linked so far to Saturday's attacks, won't have access for a while to the $6 billion unfrozen by the U.S. as part of a prisoner exchange last month.\n\nThe U.S. has reached a deal with Qatar, where the funds are held, not to release them for the time being, a U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration has being criticized for the agreement with Iran, which freed five detained Americans, and Hamas' weekend onslaught in Israel has only sharpened Republican rebukes. Administration officials say Iran will only be allowed to spend the money, which is not technically refrozen but inaccessible, for humanitarian needs.\n\n\"Funds from that account are overseen by the Treasury Department, can only be dispensed for humanitarian goods — food, medicine, medical equipment — and never touch Iranian hands,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nBlinken meets with Netanyahu in Israel\n\nBlinken expressed U.S. solidarity with Israel, its military operations in Gaza and its goal of destroying the militant Hamas organization during his meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews,\" Blinken said. \"No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or return to the conditions that allowed it to take place.\"\n\nThe war has already claimed over 2,500 lives on both sides. International aid groups warn that the death toll may rise after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to Gaza.\n\nBlinken said victims from Saturday's attack include citizens from 36 nations. He said Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of Gazans, rules repressively and funnels resources to \"terror tunnels and rockets.\"\n\nBlinken said the Israeli government shared photos and videos of Hamas' atrocities and called them \"overwhelming.''\n\n\"A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their highway runs,'' Blinken said. \"It's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way.''\n\nSocial media site X says it is removing war disinformation\n\nThe social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, has removed or labeled tens of thousands of pieces of \"illegal\" content that encouraged violence or misrepresents the war, CEO Linda Yaccarino said. Yaccarino released a statement in response to a warning from the European Commission that X could face penalties if it did not take action against \"illegal content and disinformation\" since Hamas' attack on Israel.\n\n\"There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time,\" Yaccarino's statement said.\n\nUS brings 'massive' firepower to region as deterrent\n\nAustin plans to meet with military and civilian leaders to signal the depth of the U.S. commitment to Israel and to assess its requests for security assistance, according to a senior Defense official.\n\nIsrael has received its first shipment of weaponry this week, according to the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Israel has sought missile interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, precision-guided munitions and artillery shells. Shipments from Pentagon supplies are expected to be continuous, the official said.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. military continued to build a “massive amount” of firepower in the Middle East this week as a warning to adversaries not to attack Israel, the official said. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and the ships in its strike group are operating in the eastern Mediterranean with intelligence and long-range strike capabilities, the official said. In addition, a squadron of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived in the region Thursday.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAcross US, families wait for news about loved ones in Israel\n\nGillian Kaye awoke Saturday to a nightmare: Her stepson was missing.\n\nSagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen by his family early that morning in Israel when Hamas destroyed his home as part of an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns near the border with Gaza. He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.\n\n“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.\n\nDekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.\n\nAccording to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs. Kaye and her family are urging Americans to write to their representatives in Congress to bolster search and rescue efforts. With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.\n\n“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”\n\n− Heather Bushman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nFBI provides expertise in finding hostages\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working with families of missing Americans to locate their loved ones, including those taken hostage. The department offered Israel assistance through the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, Operational Security Division and Laboratory Division.\n\n“These highly trained hostage rescue specialists and other experts stand ready to advise their Israeli counterparts to help locate and bring home missing U.S. citizens,” said Garland, whose ancestors fled religious persecution in Eastern Europe.\n\n“And, as always, we remain focused on the threat terrorism poses to our country,” Garland added.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nA summary of Israel-Hamas war\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nBy land, sea, air and online: How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.\n\nWar quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/21/trump-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites/84303364007/", "title": "US bombs nuclear sites in Iran; Trump issues warning: Recap", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news of and reaction to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, June 21. For the latest news on President Trump and the potential for Iran retaliation, follow USA TODAY's live updates for Sunday, June 22.\n\nThe United States joined Israel’s war with Iran after President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on three nuclear targets, winning praise and condemnation from members of Congress and new defiance from Tehran.\n\n\"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated,\" Trump said in a live address on June 21, threatening further U.S. strikes if Iran failed to accept a diplomatic solution.\n\nBombs and missiles launched from U.S. warplanes hit nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz. No U.S. personnel were injured in the operation, which struck Iran well after midnight on June 22 local time.\n\nWith 40,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region, the United States faces potential Iranian reprisals in the days ahead.\n\nAbbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, warned that the country \"reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" saying America's strike was \"outrageous and will have everlasting consequences.\"\n\n\"Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,\" he said on social media.\n\nTrump’s move was assailed by some conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats in Congress as illegal, while others praised him after more than a week of Israeli airstrikes on Iran and retaliatory missile fire wreaking havoc in Israel.\n\n\"There will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,\" Trump said.\n\nIsrael says Iran launched another round of missiles\n\nMultiple explosions were heard in central Israel, including over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, in the early hours of June 22. Israel's military said sirens that sounded across the region were \"due to another Iranian missile launch.\"\n\nMillions of people in the country entered safe rooms and bomb shelters as explosions rang out. The health ministry said 86 people were injured overnight.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many missiles had pierced Israel's air defense systems, but police confirmed at least three impact sites in residential areas in central and northern Israel.\n\nVideo from Tel Aviv and the port city of Haifa further north showed rescue teams combing through debris, apartments reduced to rubble, mangled cars along a street filled with debris and medics evacuating injured people from a row of blown out houses.\n\nIranian foreign minister issues warning\n\nIran reserves all options to defend itself after U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, Araqchi shared on X, saying the attacks were \"outrageous and will have everlasting consequences.\"\n\n\"Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,\" he said.\n\nWhat’s the risk of nuclear fallout from the Iran attacks?\n\nThe U.S. attacks against three of Iran’s nuclear facilities, following Israeli attacks over the previous week, prompted questions about the potential risks of radiological or chemical releases.\n\nBoth \"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" and the International Atomic Energy Agency have previously stated the offsite risks are low from attacks at Fordow and Natanz. But in a June 20 post, François Diaz-Maurin, an associate editor for nuclear affairs at the atomic bulletin, termed the offsite risk at Isfahan \"moderate,\" because it’s one of the \"most important sites for Iran’s nuclear program.\"\n\nHowever, the International Atomic Energy Agency said June 22 there had been no increase in off-site radiation levels reported.\n\nThe nuclear complex in Isfahan, a key site of the Iranian nuclear program, has repeatedly been attacked and extensively damaged before June 21, said Rafael Mariano Grossi, agency director. \"Based on our analysis of the nuclear material present, we don’t see any risk of off-site contamination,\" Grossi said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver\n\nAttack used bunker-buster bombs\n\nThe Pentagon’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facility employed its most powerful bunker-buster bomb as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines, according to a U.S. official.\n\nPentagon planners coordinated the attack with Israel to enter Iran’s airspace, said the official who had been briefed on the mission but was not authorized to speak publicly. B-2 bombers dropped GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, the first time they have been used in combat.\n\nThe stealth bombers were accompanied by other aircraft, the official said, though it was unclear the type of warplane. The Pentagon’s most sophisticated fighter, the F-22, was a likely candidate.\n\nTrump declared the attack a success, saying Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been completely \"obliterated.\" The official, however, said battle-damage assessments had not reached a firm conclusion.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAOC condemns Trump’s attacks, calling it a constitutional violation\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is the latest lawmaker to take to social media in the hours after Trump’s strikes on Iran to weigh in on the move, calling it \"grounds for impeachment.\"\n\n\"The President’s disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,\" she said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, published shortly after Trump’s White House address.\n\nCongress is the only branch of government that has the power to declare war, however, presidents have engaged in foreign conflicts in recent decades under the executive authority to authorize defensive strikes.\n\n\"He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nWill Iran counterattack?\n\nTehran could respond to Trump’s strikes by launching counterattacks on U.S. military bases in the Middle East, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nAmerican bases in Gulf countries and Iraq and Syria could become targets, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro told USA TODAY before Trump attacked Iran.\n\nIran could also target regional energy facilities and block oil and gas shipments from crossing the Strait of Hormuz, said Shapiro, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East in the Biden administration.\n\nRoughly 40,000 American troops are stationed in the region. Trump warned in a Truth Social post of \"far greater\" force against Iran if it pursues retaliation.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nMuslim civil rights group condemns U.S. strikes on Iran\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, blasted Trump’s attack as an \"illegal and unjustified act of war\" that favors the wishes of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people and threatens to drag the United States into a wider conflict.\n\n\"We condemn President Trump’s illegal and unjustified act of war against Iran,\" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement. \"This attack, carried out under pressure from the out-of-control Israeli government, took place despite the longstanding conclusion by our nation’s intelligence community that Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"Just as President Bush started a disastrous war in Iraq pushed by war hawks, neoconservatives, and Israeli leaders like Netanyahu, President Trump has attacked Iran based on the same type of false information put forward by those who consistently seek to drag our nation into unnecessary and catastrophic wars,\" Awad said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nPete Hegseth to hold a press conference from the Pentagon\n\nHours after the U.S. military launched strikes against three nuclear sites in Iran, Trump addressed the nation from the White House calling the operation a \"spectacular military success.\"\n\nHe said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will hold a press conference at 8 a.m. on July 22 at the Pentagon.\n\nTrump said the mission's objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the \"world's number one state sponsor of terror.\"\n\n\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill,\" said Trump. \"Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.\"\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCan Iran attack? Retaliation could happen anywhere, ex-official says\n\nTerror alert levels should be elevated in the near term, even in major cities outside the Middle East and anywhere Iran may have sleeper cells, said Andrew Borene, a former senior official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\n\"What happens next is largely going to be driven by Tehran’s next moves. Their shadow wars have never been confined to missiles, drones, and cyber attacks,\" said Borene, who is now executive director for global security at private intelligence firm Flashpoint.\n\nOffensive cyber operations on critical infrastructure, or terrorist attacks by Iranian proxies, also could rapidly derail hope for de-escalation and diplomacy in the near term, Borene said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nPeace or tragedy, Trump tells Iran\n\n\"There will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,” Trump said.\n\nHe noted that there are many other targets in Iran.\n\n\"If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,\" he said.\n\n– Sarah Wire\n\nNew York, Washington police boost security after strikes\n\nLaw enforcement in New York and Washington both increased police presence at places of worship and other sensitive sites as Americans reacted to the strikes.\n\n\"At this time, there are no known threats to the District,\" Washington's Metropolitan Police Department shared in a post on X. \"However, MPD has maintained an increased presence at religious institutions across the city.\"\n\nSimilarly, the New York Police Department said it's \"deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump says ‘future attacks’ could be worse\n\n\"Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,\" Trump said in his address to the nation. \"If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.\"\n\nHe then described tactics of the regime.\n\n\"For 40 years, Iran has been saying, 'Death to America,' 'Death to Israel,'\" he said. \"They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs. That was their specialty.\" The president appeared to be referring to attacks launched by Iran-backed militants in the years after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nNetanyahu congratulates Trump on Iran bombing\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump for bombing three Iran nuclear sites, saying the decision could lead the Middle East toward a future of \"prosperity and peace.\"\n\n\"America has been truly unsurpassed,\" Netanyahu said in a video statement. \"It has done what no other country on earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world’s most dangerous regime the world’s most dangerous weapons.\"\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is Fordow?\n\nFordow is an Iranian underground uranium enrichment facility located about 80 to 90 meters deep inside a mountain, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.\n\nIt is located 20 miles north of the Iranian city of Qom.\n\nFordow was one of three nuclear sites, including Natanz and Isfahan, that were struck by US military operations on July 21 to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. \"A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBomb-carrying B-2 stealth fleet launched from Missouri base\n\nB-2 bombers took off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in the early morning hours of June 21. The warplanes are known not only for their stealth technology but also for their ability to fly long-range and carry the big \"bunker buster\" bombs used in the June 21 mission.\n\nWith design and materials that limit its ability to be detected by enemy radar, the B-2 is thought to be the only aircraft equipped to carry the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, known as the \"bunker buster.\"\n\nThe entire fleet of B-2 stealth bombers is based at Whiteman, southeast of Kansas City, with the 509th Bomb Wing, part of the Air Force Global Strike Command.\n\nFox News reported six bunker-buster bombs were dropped on Iran's Fordow nuclear site.\n\n– Dinah Pulver\n\nDemocrats in Congress erupt at Trump\n\nDemocratic members of Congress expressed outrage over the strikes, which they said they learned about from social media.\n\n\"According to the Constitution we are both sworn to defend, my attention to this matter comes BEFORE bombs fall. Full stop,\" said Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, in a post on X.\n\nVirginia Rep. Eugene Vindman said Trump's handling of the situation was \"disgraceful.\" He asserted in a post that the U.S. was now at war with Iran.\n\n\"And so the United States goes to war with Iran without so much as a by your leave to the American people,\" he said. \"No statement, other than on social media; no notice to Congress; no serious deliberation.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is the stuff of autocrats. Disgraceful.\"\n\nWar is something only Congress can formally declare. Lawmakers have also passed resolutions that authorized the use of military force like when the U.S. invaded Iraq. Trump has not said whether he plans to continue the bombing campaign, which he described as a \"military operation\" in a post on the attack.\n\nAt least one Democrat came to Trump's defense, however: Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"As I’ve long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS. Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I’m grateful for and salute the finest military in the world,\" Fetterman said.\n\nDemocratic Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement that was critical of Trump that Congress should \"fully and immediately\" be briefed in a classified setting.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nCan the president bomb a country without Congress?\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. The president is the commander in chief of the military, which means he carries out wars that Congress approves.\n\nHowever, presidents of both political parties have perennially used the U.S. military to bomb or invade countries without formal approval from Congress. There have even been allegations that the Korean War and the Vietnam War were illegal. Congress attempted to limit presidents from using this type of power when it passed the 1973 War Powers Act.\n\nTrump was most recently criticized for potentially violating the War Powers Act when he bombed the Houthis in Yemen, notoriously discussed on the SignalGate chat that embarrassed top officials in his administration.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nB-2 bombers conducted strikes on Iranian targets\n\nB-2 bombers conducted a series of strikes on targets in Iran, according to a senior Defense Department official. There were no casualties.\n\nMeasures to protect the nearly 40,000 U.S. troops in the region have been incrementally increased over the last two weeks, said the official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Army has been at third of four levels of alert at most places in the region, the official said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nTrump to address nation at 10 pm ET\n\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social that he will be speaking to the nation at 10 p.m. ET on June 21.\n\n\"I will be giving an Address to the Nation at 10:00 P.M., at the White House, regarding our very successful military operation in Iran,\" Trump wrote. \"This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!\"\n\n– Swapna Venugopal\n\nRepublican lawmaker says Iran strike is 'not constitutional'\n\nTrump’s decision came under immediate criticism from at least one Republican in Congress: Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie.\n\nThe lawmaker shared Trump’s post on social media with the message, \"This is not Constitutional.\"\n\nMassie had previously introduced a bill to prevent Trump from going to war with Iran without congressional authorization, which drew cosponsors that included progressive Democrats such as Rep. Ro Khanna of California.\n\nThe GOP lawmaker was one of two members of Trump’s political party who voted against his tax bill in the House of Representatives last month. Trump called him a \"grandstander\" ahead of the vote and said he should be \"voted out of office.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, an ally of Trump’s, publicly pushed for the United States to stay out of the war, a half hour before Trump announced the attack.\n\n\"Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,\" she said in a post on X.\n\nGreene has been one of the most outspoken opponent's within MAGA of American military involvement in the conflict that exploded on June 13 when Israel attacked Iranian nuclear sites.\n\n\"There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first,\" she said on June 21. \"Israel is a nuclear armed nation. This is not our fight. Peace is the answer.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nState Department evacuations from Israel\n\nEarlier in the day, the State Department began evacuating American citizens and permanent residents from Israel and the West Bank, U.S Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee announced on social media.\n\n\"The Department of State has begun assisted departure flights from Israel,\" Huckabee wrote in a post on X on June 21 asking people seeking government assistance to fill out a form.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal\n\nHow the war started\n\nThe strikes followed days of Israeli bomb and drone strikes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aimed at disrupting Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon, to which Iran responded by launching missiles at Israeli civilian targets. Netanyahu had been pressing Trump to enter the war, knowing the Pentagon possesses the ability to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capability.\n\nIn his first term, Trump pulled out of the Iran deal brokered by President Barack Obama in 2015, saying it did not do enough to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. As the war between Iran and Israel has spiraled in recent days, he has repeated that Iran \"cannot\" get a nuclear weapon.\n\nIran has threatened that the United STates would suffer \"irreparable damage\" if it becomes directly involved in the conflict.\n\nThe country \"should know that any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage,\" Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on June 18.\n\nOnly US warheads could penetrate Iranian nuclear site\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has the unique capability to destroy deeply buried, fortified structures like those that house Iran’s nuclear facilities. The Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, has a \"high-performance steel alloy\" warhead case that allows the weapon to stay intact as it burrows deep into the ground, according to Pentagon documents.\n\nIn 2012, the Air Force conducted five tests of the weapon at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Data and visual inspections showed that each bombing run \"effectively prosecuted the targets.\"\n\nThere’s only one warplane in the Air Force that can carry the bomb. Each B-2 Spirit stealth bomber based at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri can hold two of the penetrators.\n\nIsrael had sought the Pentagon to drop the bombs because their penetrating weapons cannot reach the depth necessary to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/16/gaza-awaits/1709887/", "title": "Gazans scramble as punishing ground war looms", "text": "Naser Najjar and Ruby Russell Special for USA TODAY\n\nPalestinians line up for fuel, food\n\nPower supply is spotty\n\n\"People are very, very worried\"\n\nGAZA CITY — Many Gazans lined up for bread and fuel Friday while others hunkered at home, bracing for a possible ground war from Israel over the relentless barrage of rockets Hamas has been firing across the border.\n\n\"Everything has changed completely over the past few days,\" said Sukrit Kapoor, a lawyer. \"People are very, very worried. They have been stocking up on food supplies and so on to make sure they are prepared for the worst.\n\n\"People are expecting something big over the next couple of days – a ground invasion might be in the cards,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces ordered thousands of troops to mass near the border with Gaza for a possible ground offensive to take out the rocket-launching capabilities of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group that controls Gaza.\n\nIsrael's Defense Ministry requested authority Friday to move as many as 75,000 reservists to the border.\n\nMostly, the streets remained deserted as Gaza City residents gathered their families and sheltered at home, few venturing out even for the call to prayers. A few pharmacies, bakeries and supermarkets did open their doors, and those brave enough rushed out to gather supplies.\n\nMany fear that if the violence continues, there won't be enough food and fuel to go round.\n\n\"We are not sure that the food supplies in Gaza can meet the requirement for these people,\" Kapoor said. \"There are around 1.8 million people in Gaza, and given the blockade that Israel has been imposing on Gaza for the last four to five years, it is extremely difficult to obtain food supplies, and people here are really without resources.\"\n\nSince most homes and businesses rely on generators, there are also concerns over how long fuel supplies will hold out. When electricity allows, locals tried to follow developments on the latest airstrikes and rocket launches on Hamas-controlled state TV and via Twitter and Facebook, sharing worries over how long the violence would last this time around.\n\nPalestinian blogger Rana Baker in Gaza, providing updates on the situation, said it was difficult to stay online.\n\n\"Electricity is out. Will have to disappear. So worry not, and thanks!\" she tweeted.\n\nExploding shells caused worry and panic among locals. Firefighters and ambulances raced around the city, some stationed at street corners in case a strike hit a building nearby.\n\n\"I can hear at least two or three explosions every hour here,\" Kapoor said as an explosion went off in the background. \"There has been a constant bombardment through airstrikes, through the drone strikes.\"\n\nHospitals were overloaded and unprepared in terms of staff or medication, he said.\n\n\"Two of my colleagues went to the hospital in Shifa, and they were quite shocked by the conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"People have absolutely no resources to protect themselves: They don't have any safe rooms or access to bunkers, so they just try to stay inside and make sure their children are with them,\" he said. \"The best option is just to stay at home and hope that a rocket doesn't strike. People are just praying they are not the next target.\"\n\nOthers tried to make light of the situation.\n\n\"Managed to record one of the loudest explosions (hit Gaza just now) that I've heard. Will Tweet in a few minutes. :),\" Baker tweeted. \"And now, I'm training myself to know when an explosion will happen before it happens.\"\n\nIn December 2008, Israel launched a three-week military offensive in Gaza to stop a rocket barrage. The fighting left more than 1,000 Gazans dead, mostly Palestinian fighters, according to the IDF and the Hamas Interior Minister at the time.\n\nMany civilians who died in Gaza were in buildings used by Hamas fighters, according to the IDF, which blames Hamas for using civilians as human shields.\n\nTwenty-two Palestinians have been killed and more than 200 wounded in the Israeli airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe prime minister of Egypt arrived in Gaza to have discussions with Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military said its air campaign has hit 230 targets across Gaza. Palestinians continued to launch rockets into Israel throughout the day.\n\n\"I can't sleep at night with the danger my children are exposed to,\" said Om Mohammed Shaqalia, 45, in Gaza City. \"I try my best to calm them down all night long.\"\n\n\"Ever since the military actions started, I haven't let my children leave the house,\" added the mother of five. \"My husband goes out during the day to bring basic necessities for the family.\"\n\nSome residents have moved to what they consider safer areas of Gaza.\n\nMohammed Abu Qassem and his wife and six children, evacuated their home in the Al Karama neighborhood, where several military compounds are located.

For the latest news on the conflict in the Mideast, view our live updates file for Tuesday, May, 7.\n\nHamas said Monday that it had accepted a Gaza cease-fire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, but Israel reacted coolly to the announcement and said its planned assault on the southern city of Rafah would proceed.\n\nThe militant group said its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief of its acceptance of their proposal. The announcement came hours after Palestinians were warned to evacuate parts of Rafah as Israel prepared for an attack certain to worsen an acute humanitarian crisis.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the new proposal was \"far from Israel's requirements.\" Israel said the Rafah assault would go ahead − despite clear U.S. disapproval.\n\nState Department spokesman Matt Miller said the Biden administration was reviewing the Hamas announcement and \"will be discussing this response with our partners over the coming hours.”\n\nIsrael attacks Rafah: Hamas claims responsibility for deadly rocket strike\n\nEarlier Monday, an Israeli official told Reuters the deal approved by Hamas appeared to be a softened version of an Egyptian proposal that included “far-reaching” conclusions that Israel could not accept. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Hamas announcement could be a ruse to make Israel appear intransigent.\n\nIsraeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir described the announcement as a \"trick.\" “Hamas' exercises and games have only one answer: An immediate order to occupy Rafah!\" Ben-Gvir wrote on social media. \"Increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete defeat of Hamas.”\n\nIsrael began its assault on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led rampage on Oct. 7, when almost 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies. More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed and more than 77,000 have been wounded, according to Gaza's health ministry. A cease-fire that took place late last year resulted in the release of about 100 hostages.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Hamas said it had accepted a new cease-fire proposal put forward by Qatar and Egypt.\n\n∎ Israel was cool to the new proposal and said its invasion of Rafah would proceed.\n\n∎ Palestinian evacuees in Rafah were warned not to migrate toward the Egyptian or Israel borders. The announcements came one day after four Israeli soldiers were killed in a Hamas rocket attack just outside the city.\n\nJordan's king says Rafah invasion could 'lead to a new massacre'\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II warned that an Israeli assault on Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge, \"threatens to lead to a new massacre,\" according to a statement posted on social media by the Royal Hashemite Court.\n\nAbdullah met on Monday with President Joe Biden, where the two leaders affirmed their \"commitment to working to reach a sustainable ceasefire\" in Gaza, the royal court said.\n\nJordan is a key U.S. ally in the region. Last month, the Jordanian air force shot down dozens of Iranian drones headed for Israel as Tehran launched a massive revenge attack on its arch-enemy.\n\nThe White House wasn't as publicly explicit in its concerns over the potential civilian toll of a Rafah operation. Earlier this year, Biden said it would be \"catastrophic.\" On Monday the White House would only say: \"The President reiterated his clear position on Rafah\" during a phone call with Netanyahu.\n\n“Israel's order for around 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza to evacuate ahead of an offensive in Rafah puts every single Palestinian in Gaza in grave danger,\" the humanitarian group Oxfam said in a statement.\n\n−Dan Morrison\n\nIsrael skeptical of new cease-fire proposal, full speed ahead on Rafah invasion\n\nA statement from Netanyahu's office released mid-afternoon in Washington dampened hopes for a pause in the seven-month conflict.\n\n\"Israel's war cabinet has unanimously decided that Israel will continue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas to advance the release of our hostages, destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel in the future,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Meanwhile, even though the Hamas proposal is far from Israel's requirements, Israel will send a delegation to mediators to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nIsraeli evacuation announcement sends Palestinians into streets\n\nAbout 100,000 Palestinians are believed to live in the evacuation area of Rafah. The Israeli military instructed residents to evacuate ahead of a \"limited scope\" operation. Rafah, a city of about 275,000 before the war, has been overwhelmed by up to a million additional residents who fled fighting elsewhere in the embattled enclave.\n\nThe Israeli military called on residents in the eastern neighborhoods of Rafah to \"temporarily evacuate to the expanded humanitarian area\" a few miles outside the city. The warnings were issued through text messages, phone calls and Arabic media broadcasts. Thousands of residents heeding the call were crowding streets with cars, pickups and mule-drawn carts, urged on by blasts heard across eastern parts of the city.\n\nThe White House issued a statement saying the administration made its opposition to a ground invasion of Rafah clear to the Israeli government.\n\n\"We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering,\" the statement said. \"Those talks are ongoing now.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Netanyahu later spoke by phone, marking Holocaust Remembrance Day and discussing talks aimed at the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The readout's only mention of Rafah was that \"the president reiterated his clear position on Rafah.\"\n\nUS criticized for supporting Israeli military\n\nJan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Israel's allies have failed to restrain \"indiscriminate attacks\" in Gaza for months and now have failed to prevent the war from spreading to a city that become \"one of the largest displacement camps in the world.\" Those allies, which include the U.S., provided Israel with arms and thus share the responsibility, he said.\n\nHamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the evacuation order as a \"dangerous escalation\" that would have consequences.\n\n\"The U.S. administration, alongside the occupation, bears responsibility for this terrorism,\" he said.\n\nFormer Israeli intel official chastises West for criticisms\n\nFormer Israeli Intelligence official and regional analyst Avi Melamed said the evacuation orders are likely the first phase in a \"slow and deliberate\" Israeli assault on the city. In an email to USA TODAY, Melamed said Israel understands the \"diplomatic challenges\" and suggested the tempo of its operations will differ from the rapid attacks elsewhere in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli leaders hope the Rafah operation helps dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure and capabilities while also increasing the pressure on Hamas leaders to sign a deal, Melamed said. He chastised the West for criticizing Israel's military operations and said Hamas must be held accountable for its actions to encourage participation in a peace process.\n\n\"The diplomatic outcry by Western leaders in response to the evacuation orders illustrates why Hamas continues its firm opposition to meaningful compromise,\" Melamed said. Hamas \"knew and expected that any Israeli move toward Rafah would be met with public outcry.\"\n\nColumbia University cancels graduation ceremony\n\nColumbia University, the epicenter for campus protests opposing Israel's war in Gaza, announced Monday that it will not hold its main commencement ceremony following weeks of protests. In a news release, the university said it chose to make \"school-level ceremonies\" and other smaller celebrations the centerpiece of this year's graduation instead of a \"large, formal ceremony\" originally scheduled for May 15.\n\n\"We will focus our resources on those school ceremonies and on keeping them safe, respectful, and running smoothly,\" the university said, adding that a \"festive event\" may still take place next week.\n\nMonday's announcement came as universities continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protests on campus. At Columbia, the New York Police Department made 112 arrests Tuesday while dismantling an encampment and ushering protesters out of an administration building.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nEU calls on Israel to abandon ground invasion of Rafah\n\nIsrael's warning on Rafah prompted a global outcry. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell denounced Israel's evacuation orders, saying they \"portend the worst: more war and famine.\" He called on Israel to drop plans for a ground offensive, saying the \"international community can and must act to prevent such scenario.\"\n\nJordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also urged the world to act, warning that \"another massacre of the Palestinians is in the making.\"\n\n\"All must act now to prevent it. Failure to prevent the massacre will be an indelible stain on the international community,\" he said. \"Too many massacres have been allowed. Enough.\"\n\nUN agencies warn humanitarian crisis will worsen\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees warned that an Israeli offensive in Rafah would mean \"more civilian suffering and deaths.\" The consequences would be \"devastating\" for 1.4 million people, the agency said in a statement. Director Philippe Lazzarini urged both sides to reach agreement on a cease-fire or risk an expansion of the \"already man-made famine.\"\n\n\"UNRWA is not evacuating,\" the statement said. \"The agency will maintain a presence in Rafah as long as possible and will continue providing lifesaving aid to people.\"\n\nUNICEF warned that a \"military besiegement and ground incursion\" in Rafah would pose catastrophic risks to the 600,000 children sheltering there. Many already are injured, sick, malnourished, traumatized or living with disabilities, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said.\n\n“Many have been displaced multiple times and have lost homes, parents and loved ones,\" Russell said. \"They need to be protected.”\n\n'There are no safe zones in Gaza'\n\n\"A military offensive through Rafah risks becoming the deadliest phase of the horrific war in Gaza,\" Egeland said, adding that neighboring areas are destroyed or so overcrowded they cannot handle the influx of evacuees.\n\nThe aid agency ActionAid warned of \"catastrophic consequences\" and urged the international community to \"act swiftly to prevent further atrocities.\"\n\n\"Our aid workers are reporting some of the most severe conditions in recent memory with widespread disease, starvation and chaos,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Let us be clear, there are no safe zones in Gaza.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-attack-timeline-intl", "title": "Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: What we know so far ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders.\n\nAt dawn, troops and armor crossed into eastern Ukraine from the Russian border, as well as from Belarus in the north and from Russia-annexed Crimea to the south.\n\nHere’s how it unfolded.\n\nStirrings in Crimea\n\n3:59 a.m. (8:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday): Livestream video from a border crossing station between Crimea – which was annexed by Russia in 2014 – and parts of southern Ukraine viewed by CNN showed what may have been the first signs of the Russian invasion.\n\nIn the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border.

While the demonstrations have not led to any divestments, the week of protests have had broad impacts, forcing classes to move online and disrupting graduation plans.\n\nOn Thursday, law enforcement in riot gear broke up a peaceful demonstration at the University of Ohio. Arrests also occurred the same day at Indiana University and the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe dayslong demonstrations have centered on the war in Gaza that was triggered by Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas and the resulting bombardment and ground assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, leveled large swaths of Gaza and caused a humanitarian crisis that's left the population on the brink of starvation.\n\nArrests continue into the weekend in multiple states\n\nIn the early morning hours on Arizona State University's campus, police arrested 69 people on trespassing charges after protesters refused to leave encampments, the school said.\n\nAlso on Saturday morning, police cleared out an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. About 100 people were detained, and those with student IDs were released and will face disciplinary action, university spokesperson Renata Nyul said in an emailed statement.\n\nLater Saturday, Northeastern's campus was back to normal, with admissions tours taking place and students posing for graduation photos, the school said in an emailed statement. At other Boston area schools, encampments continued through the day.\n\nAnd at Indiana University in Bloomington, another 23 protesters were arrested Saturday by police in riot gear, the Indiana Daily Student reported. Police also dismantled tents, poured out water and took food from the encampment, according to the paper. The action came after the school announced a policy change banning temporary structures without prior approval earlier this week.\n\nMIT president says protests must end soon\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology officials had been in talks with protesters who have set up camp, but the students made clear they would not accept less than their full demands, which include cutting research funding ties with Israel's military, university President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement Saturday.\n\nIn a video statement, Kornbluth said administrators had thus far chosen not to interfere with the protests despite violation of school rules about reserving space to demonstrate. The protests at MIT have been peaceful, she said, though campus police have been present at all times.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth said, \"this particular form of expression needs to end soon.\"\n\nKornbluth said the encampments are a \"magnet\" to outside agitators, are violating campus rules and are taking away resources and staff hours from other campus functions.\n\n\"Rules have already been broken. Those who break our rules – including rules around the time, place and manner of protest – will face disciplinary action,\" she said.\n\nColumbia students file civil rights complaint against university\n\nColumbia University students and Palestine Legal filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights against the university Thursday. The complaint alleges harassment, death threats, doxing, stereotyping and unequal treatment by Columbia administrators, including President Minouche Shafik.\n\nMaryam Alwan, one of the complainants, told USA TODAY the harassment – both online and in person – has impeded her academic progress. She has to delay her graduation a year, she said.\n\nThe university did not provide comment to USA TODAY on the complaint.\n\n“I’m unable to focus on my classes anymore,” Alwan said. “The narrative is that the protests are extremely harassing and discriminatory when in reality the only discrimination that I’ve faced has been at the protest by counter-protesters.”\n\nPalestine Legal is also asking the DOE to investigate Columbia’s decision to allow “NYPD officers in riot gear — for the first time in decades — to arrest over a hundred students peacefully protesting Israel’s genocide last week.” The OCR does not comment on pending investigations, an Education Department spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nAlwan says she hopes for “deep institutional changes,” including mandatory training about anti-Palestinian discrimination, protections for academic freedom to teach about Palestinian history and “equal treatment across the board.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nACLU to US university leaders: Don't sacrifice free speech\n\nThe ACLU sent an open letter Friday evening to American public and private universities urging them to protect free speech and academic freedom. The letter came in response to anti-war protests across the U.S. that have resulted in “disturbing arrests,” according to a news release from the civil rights organization.\n\n“As you fashion responses to the activism of your students (and faculty and staff), it is essential that you not sacrifice principles of academic freedom and free speech that are core to the educational mission of your respected institution,” said the letter, authored by ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero and David Cole, the national legal director.\n\nACLU recommended guardrails to ensure this, such as not singling out particular viewpoints for censorship. Students should be protected from targeted discriminatory harassment, but institutions “may not penalize students for taking sides on the war in Gaza, even if expressed in deeply offensive terms,” the letter said.\n\nThe letter said students should have ample room to express themselves even as schools announce and enforce reasonable content-neutral protest policies and armed police on campus should be a measure of last resort. ACLU added, \"Schools must resist the pressures placed on them by politicians seeking to exploit campus tensions.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nChicago students call for disbanding of campus police\n\nOne day after students at Northwestern University set up an encampment, other Chicago-area universities joined in. At the University of Chicago where students demanded the school disband its private police force alongside demands of breaking with Israeli institutions.\n\nOver 200 students joined in the march at the campus on Chicago’s South Side, according to local media reports. Chief among their demands was the disbandment of the university’s police force, which is reported to be among the largest private police forces in the city.\n\nA university spokesperson reported no arrests at the South Side protest and did not comment on the group’s demands.\n\nIn downtown Chicago, students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College Chicago and Roosevelt University also protested, marching along Michigan Avenue before police ushered them into Millennium Park, as seen in videos shared on social media by attendees.\n\nStudents at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the central part of the state set up an encampment on campus as well, according to videos shared on social media that showed dozens of students camped out and about a dozen tents.\n\nCampus police attempted to break up the encampment and arrested one person Friday, according to student media. Videos shared on social media show dozens of officers tussling with dozens of students who locked arms around the encampment. The university's police department did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation of the arrest.\n\n− Michael Loria\n\nTent protest movement grows at UNC\n\nStudents at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill organized tents, tarps and air mattresses in a central courtyard on Friday, one week after the first pro-Palestinian encampment popped up on campus. Tents stood for around four hours before being taken down at the request of university administration.\n\nOrganizers at the school, one of the most prestigious public universities in the country, say UNC’s place in the South is an important part of the national movement pushing for university divestiture from Israel.\n\n“It feels exhilarating and inspiring,” Slyvie Tudor, a graduate student with UNC Students for Justice in Palestine, told USA TODAY. “It has to start somewhere, and I think it’s really meaningful that we’re at a public university in the South,” Tudor said, referencing how North Carolina’s Republican-controlled state legislature makes decisions impacting the university.\n\nOn Friday, professors, town residents and students gathered beneath a canopy of tall, leafy trees and amid pops of bright orange and blue camping gear as protest leaders made announcements on bullhorns.\n\nMuslim students prayed and organizers took down tent poles at around 1:30 p.m., laying the gear flat on the ground in response to university requests to take down tent structures. As the landscape of the encampment shifted, dialogue and conversations about the war in Gaza continued uninterrupted.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nGroup of onlookers at UNC say they stand against attacks on Israel\n\nOn Friday afternoon, a smaller group of demonstrators gathered in UNC’s Polk Place courtyard, saying they were there to stand against the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel, and to stand in support of Jewish students.\n\n“We’re just here to show up,” said Rabbi Dovid Cohen, adding he doesn’t identify as a counter protester. He said he visits Chapel Hill every year during the Passover holiday.\n\nAt times, the small group, comprising around a dozen men, women and children, exchanged chants with the more than 100 pro-Palestinian student encampment protesters.\n\n“When one group, especially a minority, feels targeted, we’re here for them, we’re their Jewish brothers,” Cohen said, pointing to one onlooker, whom he said was visibly Jewish, who was being followed around by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe onlooker encircled the pro-Palestinian tent encampment on foot for nearly 20 minutes Friday afternoon, filming while students from the encampment tried to block his phone camera. Pro-Palestinian students said they did not filming to avoid the risk of being doxxed online for their political views.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhite House condemns Columbia protest leader's call for Zionists to die\n\nThe White House on Friday condemned antisemitic remarks that surfaced this week from one of the leading student organizers of the pro-Palestinian encampment at Columbia University.\n\n\"These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,\" Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement. \"It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews.\"\n\nThe student, Khymani James, says in a video taken in January, \"Zionists don’t deserve to live” and “Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists.\" James refers to Zionists as \"supporters of genocide.\"\n\n\"Zionists, they shouldn't live in this word,\" James says in the video, comparing Zionists to others \"who don't deserve to live\" such as Nazis, fascists and racists. \"I feel very comfortable − very comfortable − calling for those people to die.\"\n\nOn Friday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, James apologized for his remarks: \"What I said was wrong. Every member of our community deserves to feel safe without qualification.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nFashion Institute of Technology protesters occupy university museum\n\nJoining a constellation of city universities protesting the war in Gaza, students at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan set up an encampment Thursday inside the college's 'Museum at FIT' or Goldman Center. On Friday, a group of demonstrators milled around outside holding signs as some students sat inside among the scattered tents reading and talking.\n\nStudents outside declined to speak with the press, referring instead to a press statement on the FIT Students for Justice in Palestine Instagram which lists their demands. The demands include the FIT Foundation, SUNY and Suny Research Foundation committing to financial transparency and President Joyce Brown and SUNY Chancellor John King making a public statement acknowledging genocide in Gaza.\n\nUntil demands are met demonstrators plan to hold their ground in what signs are dubbing the \"liberated zone\" and \"The People's Museum: FIT Gaza Solidarity Encampment.\"\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nArizona State University encampment doused by sprinklers\n\nArizona State University police said three people were arrested Friday morning as dozens of Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up tents on the campus and called for an official statement from the university condemning the violence in Gaza.\n\nSprinklers around the protesters were turned on after the first round of arrests, leading some in the crowd to use buckets and tarps to block the flow of water. Campus police said it did not know who set off the sprinklers.\n\nAs the crowd of demonstrators swelled to around 100, the group was eventually able to build back its encampment.\n\nThe Ybarra Maldonado Law Group is seeking to represent those arrested on Friday. Attorney Ray Ybarra Maldonado told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, he is concerned the protesters’ First Amendment rights and right to due process were violated when police arrested demonstrators within the first twenty minutes of the demonstration.\n\n− Helen Rummel, Arizona Republic\n\nPolice: 36 protesters arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University\n\nDozens of people were arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University when police disbanded an encampment that had been set up outside the student union.\n\nPolice records show that 36 people were arrested starting at 10:16 p.m. Thursday and charged with criminal trespassing, a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $250 fine, reported the Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAmong the 36 arrested, only 15 were current undergraduate or graduate students at Ohio State, according to a check done of the university's online directory. The protesters were released on their own recognizance − without having to pay any bond amount − and are scheduled to have their first appearances in Franklin County Municipal Court early next week.\n\nVideos showed scuffles in which police in riot gear took protesters to the ground as onlookers screamed for help. Skyler Goody, 21, an OSU junior, said she and her roommate were nearly arrested as she helped form a circle around the encampments.\n\n\"People of Columbus, look at how your cops treat people,\" Goody said. \"I don't know what the students were doing that warranted riot gear and pushing people over while they're praying.\"\n\n− Shahid Meighan and Cole Behrens, Columbus Dispatch\n\nRevolving demonstrations outside gates of Columbia University\n\nAs Columbia’s encampment quietly hummed on a sunny Friday morning, just outside campus gates, revolving protests were taking place.\n\nFirst hundreds gathered in a pro-Israel demonstration, waving Israeli flags and holding images of hostages taken by Hamas and other militants in the Oct. 7 attacks, chanting “Bring them home now! Alive!” New York City police, donning helmets and batons, stood behind barricades as the rally concluded peacefully.\n\n“There are people that support Israel, that believe Israel has the right to exist,” said retired educator Lois Stavsky, 76, a self-described “left-wing Zionist” who had returned after three months in Israel and Europe because she “didn’t like the vibes” in New York, home to the world’s largest Jewish population outside of Tel Aviv. She saw the student encampment as “mindless,” she said. “I think they’re naive. I don’t hate them. I kind of feel sorry for that mob mentality.”\n\nSoon after, the space was occupied by a large group of Hasidic Jews, who were holding signs reading \"All Palestine must be returned to Palestinian Sovereignty\" and \"Judaism Rejects Zionism.\" They could be heard chanting \"one, two, three, four, Zionism no more. Five, six, seven, eight, stop the killing, stop the hate.\"\n\nCharges dropped against 57 protesters arrested at University of Texas\n\nAll charges have been dropped against the 57 people arrested in connection with the Wednesday pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas.\n\nThe Travis County attorney's office said all 57 arrests, which were all criminal trespassing charges, lacked probable cause. County Attorney Delia Garza, whose office handles misdemeanor cases, told the American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Thursday that her office agreed with defense lawyers that there were \"deficiencies\" with the probable cause arrest affidavits.\n\nWhile state police with the Texas Department of Public Safety and officers with the Austin Police Department were seen handcuffing people at Wednesday's protest, all 57 arrests were technically by the University of Texas Police Department. This means university police filled out each of the 57 probable cause affidavits.\n\nNouha Ezouhri, an attorney with the Travis County public defender's office, helped file jail release forms for those arrested at the protest. She told the American-Statesman on Thursday that it looked like university police \"copied and pasted\" each probable cause affidavit for every person arrested.\n\n\"That's not how it's supposed to be,\" Ezouhri said.\n\n− Skye Seipp, Austin American-Statesman\n\nPolice stand guard at George Washington University encampment\n\nAt the entrance of a cordoned off yard at George Washington University in the nation's capital, a statue of George Washington was draped with a Palestinian flag. The statue was surrounded by dozens of tents where students had camped out overnight. Police stood guard.\n\nFor hours, protesters chanted “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation” and “The people united will never be defeated.” The sidewalk was covered with messages written in chalk, including: “Fund education not decimation.”\n\nSome protesters came from nearby universities, including American University and Georgetown University, and others from communities in the metropolitan area.\n\n“We're here first and foremost for Palestine,\" said Yasin Shami, who is part of the Palestinian Youth Movement. “We will not leave until our demands are met.\"\n\nShami said he and others want the university to disclose how it is spending money and who it partners with and reverse disciplinary actions against students participating in pro-Palestine protests.\n\nSome counter protesters yelled, “You all are terrorist supporters.”\n\nAnother person in the crowd waving an Israeli flag shouted, “Bring them home.”\n\n− Deborah Barry\n\nUT president asked for state law enforcement help with protest\n\nUniversity of Texas President Jay Hartzell told a state lawmaker that he and other officials sought law enforcement help from the state leading up to a large pro-Palestinian protest Wednesday that led to more than 50 arrests because “our police force couldn’t do it alone,” according to text messages obtained by the Austin American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn response to message from state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, D-Austin, asking about the heavy law enforcement presence at the University of Texas at Austin, Hartzell said, “We asked for help, Senator. They indicated their desire to mimic what happened at Columbia and elsewhere, which we are doing our best to avoid for obvious reasons.\"\n\n“I can’t speak to the other campuses, but this group is a chapter of a national organization that has done this elsewhere. They clearly intended to break our protest rules, despite our statements to them that we couldn’t allow them to do so. I wish we weren’t in this situation.”\n\nThe campus protest on Wednesday was planned by the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a registered student group. Republican pundits and politicians hailed the heavy law enforcement response, while multiple faculty members and students have called for Hartzell to resign. Members of the UT chapter of the American Association of University Professors also began collecting signatures for a letter stating faculty members have \"no confidence\" in Hartzell on Thursday afternoon.\n\n−Tony Plohetski and Bayliss Wagner, Austin American-Statesman\n\nTrump weighs in on college protests, calling them 'tremendous hate'\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday described the ongoing protests and unrest at college campuses across the U.S. as \"tremendous hate\" and placed the blame at the feet of his opponent in the upcoming presidential election, Joe Biden.\n\n\"This is tremendous hate and we have a man that can’t talk about it because he doesn’t understand it,\" Trump said following the day’s testimony in his hush money trial in New York. \"He doesn’t understand what’s going on with our country.\"\n\nTrump's comment's follow statements from several Republican members of Congress who accused university administrators of allowing harassment toward Jewish students − allegations which led to the ousting of the president's of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“It's detestable. As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism has spread across other campus,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday during a visit to the Columbia campus. “Anti-Israel encampments are popping up in universities all across this country. The madness has to stop.”\n\nColumbia students frustrated with politicians' response\n\nJonathan Ben-Menachem, a PhD student with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, told reporters that the students “encourage all politicians to take the time to understand what is happening in Gaza and at universities around the country.”\n\n“Mike Johnson parachuted in here with no regard for the actual safety of Jewish students,” Ben-Menachem said Friday.\n\n“White supremacists have been invigorated by our encampments because they see that we are a multiracial coalition composed of primarily Black, brown and Jewish students – everything that they hate.\"\n\nStudents also expressed frustration when asked how they respond to accusations that they support Hamas. “Hamas backed these protests at Columbia,” Johnson tweeted Thursday.\n\n“We find that question deeply racist,” said Sherif Ibrahim, a graduate student with CUAD. “We want to say that we are here for Palestinian liberation and to label us as Hamas supporters is deeply problematic. Students are here because they want an end to a genocide.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nMore student encampments form at New York City schools\n\nOn Friday, the antiwar encampment at the City College of New York entered its second day with about three dozen tents visible at the center of its West Harlem campus.\n\nOn a flagpole with the American flag, people added a Palestinian flag. Signs in support of the City University of New York public school system divesting from Israel were at the base of the flagpole. Inside the encampment, a few people served coffee, water and food.\n\nOn Thursday, when the encampment at CUNY first formed, campus public safety attempted to enter the space but were forced out. City College is a public school part of the CUNY system and its campus is largely open. Demonstrators at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a public school part of the State University of New York system, also formed an encampment protesting the war at its Manhattan campus.\n\nNYU's Manhattan Campus settled into a relative calm Friday afternoon after several days of protests. Gould Plaza, the courtyard in front of the Stern School of Business where student demonstrators clashed with police earlier in the week was completely walled off with school security guards sitting nearby.Keana Nelson, a 24-year-old graduate student studying social work, expressed disappointment over the school's response to the protests. \"In the past, like, during the Vietnam war when students were protesting, law enforcement used to subdue the protests and we saw how negatively that went,\" she said. \"So it's like now we're doing it again, we haven't even learned.\"\n\nCity College of New York begins negotiations with student protesters\n\nThe student encampment at the City College of New York began negotiations Friday afternoon with the public school’s administration.\n\nStudents are demanding CUNY divest from all companies profiting from weapons, surveillance and construction Israel is using against Palestinians, a boycott of all academic trips to Israel, including birthright and the Fulbright program, while affirming Palestine’s right to national liberation and right of return to Palestinians.\n\nThey also seek the removal of the NYPD from CUNY campuses, in addition to ending collaboration with Reserve Officers' Training Corps and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security. The last demand includes restoring free tuition at CUNY, which has undergraduate tuition for New York state residents at $7,000 per year.\n\nOrganizers declined to comment before negotiations. Jay Mwamba, a CUNY spokesperson, said the administration had no comment “except to reiterate that for the students, faculty and staff across our campus, our most important goal is the safety of our entire campus community.”\n\nCUNY faculty and staff held a picket in support of the encampment. The university system’s Professional Staff Congress, the union representing faculty and staff, issued a statement against police arresting protesters.\n\nCity College is currently on spring break until classes resume on Wednesday.\n\n“This is sort of, in no uncertain terms, a labor issue, the repression of free speech, of academic freedom,” said graduate student Zoe Hu, the chapter president for CUNY’s Graduate Center, in midtown Manhattan. “On top of that, Israel has destroyed all of the universities in Gaza. It has wiped out an entire educational system.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nImprisoned political activist, journalist speaks to student encampment by speakerphone\n\nIncarcerated political activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal told USA TODAY he supports “anti-imperialist” student encampments spreading across the country to protest the war in Gaza. He has been in prison for over 40 years after being convicted for the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned by a federal court. He has maintained his innocence.\n\nToday’s activism on college campuses reminds 70-year-old Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther, of his youth during protests against the war in Vietnam and the civil rights movement for Black Americans, he said in a brief phone call from Mahanoy state prison in Pennsylvania. He compared the protests to people once holding up lighters at concerts. Today, people tend to use cell phones.\n\n“These are flickers of light in an anti-imperialist movement,” he said. “It’s remarkable to see.”\n\nAbu-Jamal was set to speak Friday afternoon to the City College of New York student encampment in West Harlem, but Muslim students were in prayer on the campus lawn, so his call would be rescheduled for the evening. On Thursday, he spoke to Columbia University's student encampment via speakerphone. A microphone amplified his voice.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nNegotiations at Columbia University at an impasse\n\nColumbia University students and negotiators with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group spoke to reporters Friday about the ongoing negotiations between the university and students in the encampment. They said they have made some progress in terms of their financial disclosure demands but not with divesting from financially and academically in Israel, the group’s main demand.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik previously warned students that if the tents aren't moved by Friday, \"we will have to consider options for restoring calm to campus.\"\n\nNegotiators said they spent 11 hours yesterday and an hour today at the negotiating table. Now they say they are at an impasse.\n\nThe students said it is in their best interest to reach an agreement before commencement, which is scheduled for May 15. They also said they were met with an increased “unwillingness” to understand CUAD’s core demands.\n\n“Columbia has asked students to operate within the confined of bureaucratic red tape with no assurances of binding divestment decisions if we end the encampment,” said student negotiator Sueda Polat.\n\n“The university seems to believe students cannot maintain their resolve regarding staying on this lawn, ignoring the reality that over the past 10 days, we have demonstrated how committed we are, how high our resolve is and how truly we wish from the heart for complete divestment and boycott. They believe that they can outstand us, we tell them that we cannot.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nThe protests' impacts on classes, graduation\n\nOver the past two weeks, the large demonstrations have led university administrators to adopt new policies to deal with the protests while others have been forced to restructure class schedules and graduation ceremonies.\n\nIndiana University Bloomington this week changed its longtime policy regarding \"temporary structures\" saying students now needed prior approval from the university to set up tents on the campus' main lawn, according to the Indiana Daily Student. Northwestern University in Illinois abruptly banned temporary structures after hundreds of students joined in the nationwide antiwar protests on Thursday, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nAt Columbia, students were given a virtual class option for the rest of the semester after protests forced the university to cancel in-person classes on Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, USC announced it was canceling its main commencement ceremony for what it said were safety reasons. The decision came 10 days after administrators decided to bar valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim, from delivering a commencement address.\n\nOther schools must soon decide whether to hold their commencement ceremonies as the spring semester winds down and graduation ceremonies are scheduled for the weeks ahead.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Rachel Barber, Anna Kaufman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/16/israel-gaza-palestinian-invasion/1708301/", "title": "Air raid sirens wail in Jerusalem as violence in Gaza continues", "text": "Karin Laub, Associated Press\n\nEarly Friday, 85 missiles exploded within 45 minutes in Gaza City\n\nIsrael offered to suspend its offensive in the Gaza Strip on Friday during a brief visit by Egypt's premier there\n\nIsraeli troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers have massed near the Palestinian territory\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) — Air raid sirens have just sounded in Jerusalem, signaling a possible rocket attack aimed at Israel's capital.\n\nIf verified, it would be the first time the holy city has ever been targeted by rockets fired by Gaza militants.\n\nIsraeli media say the rocket fell north of Jerusalem, but authorities have not confirmed the reports. In Gaza, Hamas militants said they had attacked Jerusalem.\n\nMilitants already have launched several rockets into Tel Aviv since an Israeli offensive was launched in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Friday, a Palestinian rocket targeted Tel Aviv on the third day of an Israeli military operation against the Gaza Strip.\n\nSirens wailed across the city Friday afternoon shortly before the explosion sounded out.\n\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says no injuries have been reported and it appears the rocket landed in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt was the second straight day that Gaza militants have targeted Tel Aviv. The attacks, which Israel considers to be a major escalation, could draw an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza closer.\n\nOn Friday, Israel offered to suspend its offensive in the Gaza Strip during a brief visit by Egypt's premier there if militants refrain from firing rockets at Israel, an official said, but the Palestinians unleashed a fresh salvo.\n\nAn official in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader was responding to an Egyptian request.\n\nGaza militants stepped up their barrages of rocket fire into Israel as Hesham Kandil crossed into Gaza before midday through the only border post with Egypt, heavily guarded by Egyptian security personnel wearing flak jackets and carrying assault rifles.\n\nHe was greeted by Gaza's Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, who ventured out in public for the first time since Israel launched the offensive Wednesday by assassinating the militant group's military commander.\n\nMORE:Israel calls up troops in case of Gaza ground assault\n\nIsrael told the Egyptians the military \"would hold its fire on the condition that during that period, there won't be hostile fire from Gaza into Israel,\" the Israeli official said. \"Prime Minister Netanyahu is committed to the peace treaty with Egypt, which is in the strategic interest of both countries,\" he added, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic exchange.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of Israeli retaliation for the latest salvo. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the militants were making a clear statement. \"There's no intention whatsoever to stop firing into Israel,\" he said.\n\nThree days of fierce fighting between Israel and Gaza militants has widened the instability gripping the region, straining already frayed Israel-Egypt relations. The Cairo government recalled its ambassador in protest.\n\nEgypt said Kandil's three-hour visit Friday was meant as a show of solidarity with the Palestinian territory's militant Hamas rulers.\n\nEgyptian intelligence officials involved in negotiations to end previous rounds of fighting are accompanying Kandil on his visit, an Egyptian diplomat said, suggesting it was more than a display of support.\n\nThe diplomat said Gaza militants have told Egyptian intelligence officials they would be willing to hold their fire if Israel would commit to mediation to stop its military operation and targeted killings.\n\nWord of the possible pause in the fighting came after a night of fierce exchanges and signals that Israel might be preparing to invade Gaza. Overnight, the military said it targeted about 150 of the sites Gaza gunmen use to fire rockets at Israel, as well as ammunition warehouses, bringing to 450 the number of sites struck since the operation began Wednesday.\n\nIsraeli troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers massed near the Palestinian territory, signaling a ground invasion might be imminent.\n\nMilitants unleashed dozens of rocket barrages overnight.\n\nFighting between the two sides escalated sharply Thursday with a first-ever rocket attack from Gaza on the Tel Aviv area, menacing Israel's most densely populated area. No casualties were reported there, but three people died in the country's rocket-scarred south when a projectile slammed into an apartment building.\n\nThe death toll in Gaza was 19, including five children, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nEarly Friday, 85 missiles exploded within 45 minutes in Gaza City, sending black pillars of smoke towering above the coastal strip's largest city. The military said it was targeting underground rocket-launching sites.\n\nOne missile flattened sections of the Interior Ministry, leaving a huge pile of rubble, and another hit an uninhabited house belonging to a senior Hamas commander. Those strikes, together with an attack on a generator building near Haniyeh's home, signaled that Israel was expanding its offensive beyond military targets.\n\nTen-month-old Haneen Tafesh was killed Thursday when flying shrapnel from an air attack on a field next to her family's shack struck her in the head.\n\n\"What did she do? Did she fire any rockets?\" asked her 23-year-old father, Khaled Tafesh, as he waited outside the Shifa hospital morgue in Gaza City, waiting for the funeral of his only child to begin.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had largely observed an informal truce since Israel's devastating incursion into Gaza four years ago, but rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes on militant operations continued sporadically.\n\nThe Israeli offensive has not deterred the militants from firing more than 400 rockets aimed at southern Israel, the military said. On Thursday, they also unleashed for the first time the most powerful weapons in their arsenal — Iranian-made Fajr-5 rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv.\n\nThe two rockets that struck closest to Tel Aviv on Thursday appeared to have landed in the Mediterranean Sea, defense officials said, and another hit an open area on Tel Aviv's southern outskirts.\n\nNo injuries were reported, but the rocket fire sowed panic in Tel Aviv and made the prospect of a ground incursion more likely. The government later approved the mobilization of up to 30,000 reservists for a possible invasion.\n\nNetanyahu said the army was hitting Hamas hard with what he called surgical strikes, and warned of a \"significant widening\" of the Gaza operation. Israel will \"continue to take whatever action is necessary to defend our people,\" said Netanyahu, who is up for re-election in January.\n\nAt least 12 trucks were seen transporting tanks and armored personnel carriers toward Gaza late Thursday, and buses carrying soldiers headed toward the border area.\n\nAn Israeli ground offensive could be costly to both sides. In the last Gaza war, Israel devastated parts of the territory, setting back Hamas' fighting capabilities but also paying the price of increasing diplomatic isolation because of a civilian death toll numbering in the hundreds.\n\nIn the current round of fighting, the civilian casualties have been relatively low and the Israeli strikes seem to be more surgical.\n\nIn other ways, the latest hostilities are reminiscent of the first days of that three-week offensive against Hamas. Israel also caught Hamas off guard then with a barrage of missile strikes and threatened to follow up with a ground offensive.\n\nSince then, Israel has improved its missile defense systems, but it is facing a more heavily armed Hamas. Israel estimates the militants have 12,000 rockets, including more sophisticated weapons from Iran and from Libyan stockpiles plundered after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime there last year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/07/20/gaza-israel-palestinians-hamas/12904811/", "title": "Deadly day in Gaza as Israeli offensive widens", "text": "Yousef Al-Helou and Jabeen Bhatti\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nGAZA CITY — At least 65 Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers were killed Sunday in a major battle in a crowded Gaza City neighborhood on what has been the single bloodiest day of the nearly 2-week-old conflict, Israeli and Gazan officials confirmed.\n\nUnited Nations chief Ban Ki-moon called Israel's latest incursion \"atrocious,\" and said it must do far more to protect civilians.

Israel denied it.\n\n\"There's no kidnapped Israeli soldier,\" Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Ron Prosor, said Sunday night.\n\nIn Washington, President Obama spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone Sunday and said Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Cairo to press for a cease-fire.\n\nObama \"raised serious concern about the growing number of casualties, including increasing Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza and the loss of Israeli soldiers,'' the White House said in a statement.\n\nIn Shijaiyah, a neighborhood of Gaza City, Israel continued to demolish shafts and tunnels in expanded operations that began early Sunday morning.\n\nHundreds were wounded and thousands forced to flee Shijaiyah as dozens of homes were damaged or destroyed by the fighting, which included heavy Israeli tank fire. The battle was the deadliest so far since Israel started its ground offensive late Thursday night.\n\nResidents of the area described chaos as thousands tried to flee the area.\n\n\"What happened in Shijaiyah quarter was madness,\" said Majed Reda, 48, from the district. \"Oh God, me and my family cannot believe that we are still alive due to the heavy random tank shelling that lasted for over 12 hours … it's a horrific massacre … shells just rained down.\"\n\nAround the district was evidence of destruction in the rubble and smoke. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said Hamas militants put up a \"huge\" level of resistance in the neighborhood, using anti-tank missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons fired from houses and buildings. The Israeli military said 8% of the more than 1,700 rockets fired from Gaza since July 8 were from the neighborhood, a claim unable to be independently verified.\n\nTwo of the 13 Israeli soldiers killed Sunday were dual U.S.-Israel nationals, the Times of Israel reported.\n\nOne of them was identified as Sean Carmeli of South Padre Island, Texas, Chabad.org reported.\n\nMax Steinberg, a Los Angeles native and volunteer in the Israel Defense Forces, also was among the soldiers killed, JewishJournal.com reported. Steinberg, from the Woodland Hills section of the San Fernando Valley, was a sniper in Golani and joined Israeli forces in December 2012, it said.\n\nThe deaths bring the total number of Israeli military casualties to 18. Two civilians have also been killed by attacks in Israel while at least 432 Palestinians have been killed and another 3,000 wounded since the conflict began nearly two weeks ago, according to Gaza Health Ministry officials.\n\nIn this latest offensive, Lerner said, 10 tunnel-access shafts had been found in the area so far. Israel says the tunnels are used by Hamas to carry out attacks unlike tunnels on the border with Egypt — now closed — which Gazans use to bring in essential supplies such as food and fuel.\n\nKerry told CNN that Israel is justified in taking action to protect itself from attacks launched from Gaza but added that the civilian impact of the conflict is unsettling.\n\n\"Nobody, no human being can be comfortable with children being killed, but we're not comfortable with Israeli soldiers being killed either,\" he said Sunday.\n\nNetanyahu, also speaking on CNN, said the military is only targeting militants in its campaign.\n\n\"All civilian casualties are unintended by us, but intended by Hamas. They want to pile up as many civilian dead as they can … it's gruesome,\" Netanyahu said. \"They use telegenically dead Palestinians for their cause.\"\n\nBut witnesses in Gaza disputed that, saying emergency vehicles were unable to reach the wounded.\n\n\"Even ambulances came under fire and were targeted by Israeli tanks shelling,\" said Samer Hayyah, 38, of east Gaza. \"Many members of my family were injured or killed while others are still under the rubble.\"\n\n\"My home and many of my neighbors' homes were destroyed in the shelling,\" he added. \"It was very sad and painful to see people leaving their homes carrying whatever they could.\"\n\nThe situation in Gaza is growing worse — 70% of the territory was without power Sunday. Residents say they want peace.\n\n\"Daily power cuts worsen the already dire situation,\" said Nafiz Hamed, 30, of Gaza City. \"Ultimately there will be a cease-fire (and as part of that), we want the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing to open permanently, so that all goods can come in. We want to build our future and (fulfill) our dreams.\"\n\nAn Egyptian-brokered cease-fire was rejected by Hamas last week after the group said it was not consulted over the truce. Egypt's new government is hostile to the Muslim Brotherhood of its last president Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted last year, and by extension to its counterpart in Gaza, Hamas said.\n\nHamas also said any cease-fire agreement must include a lifting of the blockade by Israel and the opening of the borders with Egypt.\n\n\"The Egyptian leadership should stand by us (but) how can they be honest brokers for a cease-fire when they close the Rafah crossing?\" Hamed asked.\n\nShortages and frequent shelling have taken their toll on locals. At the same time, residents add any truce must be meaningful.\n\n\"Of course we want truce, we want to live in peace, not violence but you tell me how is that possible while we are under Israeli-Egyptian siege,\" said Yusra Mohammad, 26, of Gaza City. \"Israel must know that we will not accept the policy of collective punishment.\"\n\nBhatti reported from Berlin.

In fact, long-held fears by Biden and other Western leaders that the conflict could spark a wider war in the Middle East seem dangerously close to reality.\n\nJust last week, the conflict appeared to enter a grim new phase when Iran staged a massive missile attack on Israel following Israel’s assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas. Israel has promised to retaliate, further raising fears that what started as a regional conflict will engulf the Middle East.\n\nFor Biden, already facing political challenges at home amid a contentious presidential election in which his vice president is seeking to succeed him, the Israel-Hamas war has been particularly troublesome. It has strained U.S. relations with Israel, tested his influence on the world stage, and his administration has been hit with a torrent of criticism over whether it has done enough – or too much – in standing alongside Israel.\n\nThe outcry over Biden’s handling of the war eroded his political support among Arab-Americans and progressives, a key voting bloc for any Democrat hoping to win a second term, just as this year’s election was kicking off in earnest. Biden’s unpopularity, along with questions about whether he was physically and mentally healthy enough to serve a second term, raised serious doubts about whether he could defeat former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November.\n\nBowing to pressure, Biden ended his re-election campaign in July. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in to become the Democratic nominee and, potentially, Biden’s successor.\n\nNow a lame duck, Biden enters his final three months as president with the sobering reality that the war will almost certainly be raging even after he leaves office – and that the burden of seeing it through will fall to either Harris or Trump.\n\n'We will not stand by and do nothing'\n\nEleven days after Hamas crossed the border into Israel and began their brazen assault, Biden boarded Air Force One and made a hastily arranged trip to Tel Aviv.\n\nHis message to the Israelis and the world: The United States stands with the Jewish state.\n\nArriving at the Ben-Gurion International Airport, Biden embraced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a show of solidarity. Later, in remarks to reporters, he compared the Hamas attack to the brutality of the Holocaust.\n\n\"The world watched then and knew, and the world did nothing,\" he said. \"We will not stand by and do nothing again.”\n\nOver the coming months, the Biden administration would send billions of dollars in weapons and military equipment to Israel even as it feared the conflict in the Gaza Strip would spread. Fighter jets, surface-to-air missiles, tank ammunition, high explosive mortars, tactical vehicles – a wide range of U.S.-made weapons were made available to Israel as it prosecuted the war.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu have known each other for decades, their paths first crossing when Biden was a senator on the Foreign Relations Committee and Netanyahu was stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Washington and later at the United Nations. Through the years, their relationship was at times warm and friendly, other times tested by awkward diplomatic slights and deep policy rifts.\n\nThe war in Gaza would become the latest test as the scale of Israel’s assault on Palestinian territory came into clearer view. Over 41,000 Palestinians killed, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry. Entire neighborhoods flattened. Schools and hospitals destroyed by bombs. Nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced. Widespread disease and hunger.\n\nIn the United States, protests erupted in cities and on college campuses across the country. Supporters of Israel accused Biden of not doing enough to help its U.S. ally. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators denounced the war’s human costs, berated the U.S. for providing weapons to Israel and demanded Biden call for an immediate cease-fire. By the end of 2023, acts of antisemitism across the U.S. would increase by 140%, an all-time high, the Anti-Defamation League reported.\n\nBy December, Biden was warning Netanyahu that Israel was losing international support over the war. Five months later, in May, his administration withheld a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel amid concerns Netanyahu was nearing a decision to launch a full-scale attack on the densely populated city of Rafah in southern Gaza. Biden and his administration feared the heavy weapons could not be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing mass casualties and suffering.\n\n“We’re not walking away from Israel’s security,” Biden told CNN. “We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.”\n\nNetanyahu responded to the cancelation of the weapons shipment by declaring in a speech that Israel was prepared to stand alone if necessary.\n\nAnd the fighting continued.\n\nIn July, Israel hit back at Hezbollah, which had been firing rockets into northern Israel since the start of the war, by carrying out airstrikes in Beirut.\n\nThe attacks were a prelude of what was to come. Two months later, pagers, walkie talkies and other electronic devices used by members of Hezbollah exploded in Lebanon, killing at least 37 people, including children, and wounding nearly 3,000 others. Israel was suspected of coordinating the attack. Netanyahu had vowed to go after the culprits and punish them wherever they are.\n\nWestern leaders should understand that “when we defeat the murderers of Oct. 7th, we prevent the next Sept. 11th,” Netanyahu said.\n\nIn late July, Hamas' top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an assassination at his residence in Tehran – an attack the group and Iran blamed on Israel.\n\nThe conflict escalated further with Israel’s assassination of Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, in an airstrike in Beirut last month and with Iran’s missile attack on Israel last week. Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at various targets in Israel, most of which were shot down with the help of U.S. Navy destroyers deployed in the eastern Mediterranean. The attack was Iran’s second on Israel this year. In April, it launched 300 missiles and drones into Israel.\n\nFriends lost, relatives at odds: How Oct. 7 reshaped lives in the U.S.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of Oct. 7 assault, Biden and first lady Jill Biden lit a candle at the White House on Monday in remembrance of the victims of the attack. A rabbi recited a Jewish prayer that is often spoken during burial and memorial services to honor the soul of the deceased. The prayer was followed by a moment of silence.\n\nMeanwhile, the the world is waiting to see when and how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile attack.\n\nIsrael launched a ground offensive in northern Lebanon last week that targeted Hezbollah. Eight Israeli soldiers were killed and seven others were injured during the fighting on Wednesday. By the end of the week, the Israeli military had warned civilians in at least 20 cities to evacuate as it pressed forward with its ground attack against Hezbollah.\n\nIn Washington, Biden said his administration was considering sanctions against Iran over its airstrike against Israel. He urged Israel to respond “proportionally” and said he was discussing whether Israel should be allowed to order airstrikes on Iranian oil facilities.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has been “a paradigm shifting time in understanding the Middle East,” said Mara Karlin, a foreign policy expert and former adviser to six Defense secretaries in the administrations of Presidents Biden, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\n\nThe question now is whether Israel’s response to Iran will be a perfunctory one meant to simply deter other attacks or whether it will be on a grander scale, she said.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, continues to face criticism as his administration continues to push diplomatic efforts to bring about a cease-fire in Gaza. Negotiators for the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have been working for weeks to forge a framework for a temporary cease-fire and hostage release deal. Several times, they have felt that an agreement was within reach. Yet it remains elusive. Biden has said only Hamas stands in the way.\n\nOne of the problems the Biden administration has faced as it tries to navigate the conflict in Gaza has been Netanyahu himself, said Chuck Hagel, a former defense secretary who served alongside Biden in the Senate.\n\n“Netanyahu, I think, is not a good leader,” Hagel said. “I've known him, I've dealt with him over the years. … Biden had the challenge of dealing with an Israeli leader who has not always been honest with us, who has played games with us. That’s the reality.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s hands have been tied by Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose interests are not always the same as the U.S.’s, said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East analyst who worked in the State Department for more than 20 years as an adviser to Democratic and Republican secretaries of state.\n\n“Diplomacy is critically important,” Miller said, “but diplomacy requires urgency. And it is the absence of urgency on the part of the two key decision makers that has prevented the administration from concluding what is an eminently concludable Israel-Hamas deal, at least, to begin de-escalating the conflict.”\n\nOthers fault the Biden administration for what they say has been U.S. efforts to tie Israel’s hands and restrain its ability to conduct the war.\n\nThe administration has failed to pursue “a decent foreign policy” in regards to Israel, said Elliott Abrams, a Middle East expert who served as deputy national security adviser under Bush. The U.S., he said, has essentially taken the position that “we want to help you defend yourself – but, please God, don’t try to win.”\n\nThe Israeli response has been “that’s bad advice, and we’re not going to follow it,” he said.\n\nBradley Bowman of The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, takes issue with the administration’s public criticism of how Israel has conducted the war in Gaza.\n\n“When your best friend or your best ally in the Middle East is experiencing one of its worst days or years of its life, you don't join the bullies or the terrorists in ganging up on your friend when they've been knocked down,” said Bowman, senior director of the foundation’s Center on Military and Political Power.\n\n“If you have criticisms or concerns with your friend or your ally, you express those concerns privately,” Bowman said. “You do not level public criticisms that hurt your friend when they’re in the fight for their life. That empowers our common adversaries.”\n\nThat, he said, invites more aggression against Israel, brings more suffering, longer wars and damages American interests.\n\nIn just three months, the problem will no longer be Biden’s. Given recent events, the new president, Harris or Trump, appears almost certain to inherit the continuing conflict in Gaza – and possibly a wider war in the Middle East.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

He has sued other news organizations, including filing a $15 billion lawsuit this week against the New York Times.\n\nAs Trump left the White House on Sept. 16, he berated an ABC News reporter about how the company paid him $16 million in December 2024 to settle his lawsuit over a misstatement about a lawsuit by columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nAsked about how he would police hate speech, Trump said, “We’ll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly – it’s hate.”\n\nThe disputed Wall Street Journal article described Trump having signed a page in a birthday book for Epstein, who died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nHouse Republicans have since released the entire book, which includes a page attributed to Trump.

Yeah, according to Michael Wolff,\" he said referring to the author of several Trump books.\n\nWhen Callaghan asked Biden if he would like to apologize to the first lady, he offered a colorful response.\n\n“F--- that. That’s not going to happen,” he said, citing news reports dating back to 2019 that \"reported that sources said that Jeffrey Epstein claimed to be the person to introduce Donald Trump to Melania at that time.”\n\nTrump’s association with Epstein, whom he knew socially, has dogged him since his first term in office. In 2019, Trump said he’d had a “falling out” with Epstein, whom he described as a “Palm Beach fixture,” in the mid-2000s. Their connection was back in the spotlight when Tesla CEO Elon Musk linked Trump to Epstein during the height of their feud.\n\nTrump said he encouraged his wife's legal action against Hunter Biden.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein had nothing to do with Melania,\" Trump said August. 14, during an interview with Fox Radio's Brian Kilmeade. \"But they do that to demean. I told her to go ahead and do it. She was very upset about it.\"\n\nLast month, the Daily Beast took down an article alleging a modeling agent connected to Epstein had introduced the first lady to her husabnd.\n\nIt included an editor's note saying the publication had \"received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump’s attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Democratic strategist and podcaster James Carville issued an apology for accusing her of being introduced to Trump by Epstein. He also removed comments about the subject from the episode.\n\nThe first lady shared the apology on her X account with a red X over it.\n\nTrump’s MAGA base has long floated conspiracy theories about Epstein’s jailhouse suicide and demanded the “Epstein files” to be released. Trump’s own Vice President JD Vance used to be one of them.\n\nHowever, after Trump’s Justice Department and the FBI released a memo in early July declaring the disgraced financier died by suicide and asserted there was no evidence Epstein kept a \"client list,” the MAGA world became sharply divided, with many being critical of Trump.\n\nHunter Biden called Melania Trump’s notice a “designed distraction.”\n\n“I don't think that these threats of a lawsuit add up to anything other than a designed distraction, because it's not about who introduced whom to who,” he said. “I don't know how that in any way rises to the level of defamation to begin with.”\n\nTrump's connections to Epstein, Hunter Biden said, have become “so glaringly obvious that I think they're trying to use other things to distract − and I also think they're bullies.”\n\nBiden said he’d be “happy” to provide the president and first lady with a “platform” if they want to sit down for a deposition and clarify the nature of their relationship with Epstein.\n\n“I think the entire world would love to finally get to the bottom of the true nature of their relationship,” he said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

The lawsuit seeks \"accountability for brazen election interference committed by\" the newspaper and pollster J.

Trump won the state by 13 percentage points.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the \"egregious\" polling miss in favor of Democrats came \"just days before the most consequential election in memory,\" and that its results were apparently \"leaked\" because Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker mentioned the poll's findings during a meeting with Duke University alumni hours before the results were published.\n\n\"In my opinion, it was fraud and it was election interference,\" Trump told reporters Monday.\n\nLark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the Des Moines Register, said the company stands by its reporting and will vigorously defend the First Amendment.\n\n\"We have acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll did not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump’s Election Day victory in Iowa by releasing the poll’s full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unweighted data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer,\" Anton said in a statement. \"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe this lawsuit is without merit.\"\n\nSelzer told USA TODAY she has no comment on the lawsuit.\n\nGannett is also the parent company of USA TODAY.\n\nTrump has sued media companies repeatedly with complaints about coverage of him. Some legal experts say Trump's comments and legal actions risk discouraging coverage of his incoming administration.\n\nA federal judge dismissed Trump's $475 million lawsuit against CNN in July 2023 over the cable network referring to his description of election fraud in 2020 as a \"big lie.\"\n\nABC News reached a $15 million settlement Dec. 14 with Trump over a George Stephanopoulos question to a House member in March about a lawsuit columnist E.

Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, which he's taken over as board chairman.\n\n\"We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading. I don't believe we're going to redact anything,\" Trump said.\n\nThe release of the files comes after Trump signed a day one executive order in January aimed at fully releasing government documents related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother and presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was shot and killed on Nov. 22, 1963 while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His assassination has long been the subject of conspiracies after Lee Harvey Oswald, the Marine veteran identified as Kennedy's assassin, was shot and killed days later.\n\nWhile millions of government records related to the Kennedy assassination have been previously released, some information remains classified and redacted. Trump said he instructed his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, to oversee the release of he remaining files.\n\nA federal law passed in 1992 required the Kennedy assassination records to be fully released by Oct. 26, 2017 unless the president at the time determined their release would cause \"identifiable harm\" to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations of such gravity that it \"outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"\n\nTrump was president when the 2017 deadline arrived. He ordered the release of nearly 2,900 records, but kept others secret because of concerns by the CIA and FBI that their release could hurt national security.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden acted in 2021, 2022 and 2023 to give agencies more time to review the records.\n\nThe documents released in 2017 included details on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency investigations into Oswald and information on covert Cold War operations.

Elizabeth Warren has been slashed in half. And most Democratic voters say they could still change their minds.\n\nAlmost exactly one year before Election Day – and 96 days before the opening Iowa caucuses – Biden was backed by 26% of likely Democratic primary and caucus voters in the survey. Warren was second at 17%, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%.\n\nBiden's lead over Warren, now 9 percentage points, was 18 points in the last USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, taken in late August. His standing has fallen by 6 points since then; hers has risen by 3.\n\n\"My front-runner would be Biden,\" Nathaniel Dortch, 77, an Air Force retiree from Moreno Valley, California, who was among those surveyed, said in a follow-up interview. Then he added, \"I want to wait and see.\"\n\nIn a sign of the prospect for changes ahead, 18% of likely Democratic voters were undecided. Among those with a preferred candidate, a 57% majority said their minds weren't firmly made up.\n\n\"I am undecided in supporting a specific candidate right now because I am not looking for the issue differential, I want someone best equipped to take on Donald Trump,\" said Freyr Thor, 56, a tech CEO from South Pasadena, California. He's worried about what he's seen, and hasn't seen, in the Democrats' televised debates so far. \"No one has shown me they can take on Trump, including Biden.\"\n\nTrump vs. any Dem: Who will win?\n\nIn a match-up between President Trump and an unnamed Democratic nominee, Trump narrowly led, 41%-39%, with 10% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate. Another 10% were undecided. That was a shift, albeit one within the margin of error, from the August survey, when the unnamed Democrat held a narrow lead over Trump, 41%-39%.\n\nIn the new poll, Republicans expressed overwhelming confidence about the outcome of the election, with 86% predicting the president would win. Seventy-five percent of Democrats said their nominee would win. But independents by a double-digit margin expected Trump to prevail.\n\nDespite the cloud of impeachment, overall those surveyed predicted by 50%-40% that the president in the end would claim a second term.\n\n\"Trump has done a lot of the things he has set out to do,\" said John Siefkas, 52, a farmer and political independent from Osceola, Iowa, who was called in the poll. \"He needs to keep his hands off Twitter, (but) he is doing some stuff that is needing done that people haven't had the guts to do.\"\n\nWilliam Collins, 56, an independent who is a retired police investigator from Fort Valley, Virginia, also plans to vote for the president. \"I believe Trump has directed America in the right direction, and I think he really has the American people in his own heart.\"\n\nTrump's job-approval rating was 46% approve-52% disapprove, with 27% saying they \"strongly\" approved and 37% saying they \"strongly\" disapproved.\n\nUSA TODAY interview with David Rubenstein: 'The country will survive whatever happens now'\n\nThe telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters nationwide, taken Oct. 23-26, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The sample of 399 likely Democratic voters has an error margin of 4.9 points; the sample of 323 likely Republican voters has an error margin of 5.5 points.\n\nLarge field helps Biden\n\nThose surveyed were split down the middle when it comes to Congress: 43% said they supported the Democratic candidate in their district; 42% the Republican. Asked whether they would prefer Democrats or Republicans to win control of Congress next November, they divided 46%-46%.\n\nThe Democratic field now has a top tier of four candidates – Biden, Warren, Sanders and now Buttigieg, whose standing rose 4 points from the August poll. They were followed by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 4% – up from less than 1% last time – and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris was also at 3%, a drop of 3 points from August. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, credited with a strong performance in the last debate, was at 2% – not a big number, but better than in August, when she registered no support. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also was at 2%.\n\nNone of the other 11 candidates had support higher than 1%, a troubling sign as they try to raise money and break through. Seven of them had either no or only a single backer in the survey.\n\n\"I like Warren, Harris and Booker,\" said Doleen Reynolds, 51, an independent from Slidell, Louisiana, who is concerned that Biden \"would compromise too much\" with progressive principles. \"But if he gets the nomination, I will vote for him, because we cannot have the alternative.\"\n\nThe big field is helping Biden, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"Biden's strength has been, at best, fixed, and he benefits from so many other candidates splitting the non-Biden voters,\" Paleologos said. \"Overall, Biden has led in the national polls for some time but you can't flatline to the Iowa caucuses.\"\n\nYearning for more candidates\n\nThe Democratic field has set records for size, but almost one in five Democrats, 18%, said they wished someone else would jump into the race. In response to an open-ended question about who, 10% identified former first lady Michelle Obama, 7% said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and 4% said Hillary Clinton, the party's 2016 nominee.\n\nAmong Republicans, a similar number, 17%, said they wished someone else would enter the GOP contest. Asked who, 8% said former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and 6% said Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee.\n\nMitt Romney: A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\n\nNone of the three Republicans who are already running are cutting into Trump's support. In the poll, 85% of likely GOP voters backed Trump. Two percent supported former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld; and 1% each supported former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and former Illinois Rep.

You think I'm not on that list?\" he told his sidekick Guillermo Rodriguez as he joked about leaving the country in a clip ahead of his monologue.\n\nKimmel got choked up as he recounted election night in front of his audience.\n\n\"It was a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hardworking immigrants who make this country go, for health care, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech,\" he said. \"It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on Social Security, for our allies in Ukraine, for NATO, for the truth and democracy and decency.\"\n\nHe also said it was a terrible night for those who voted for Trump, \"you just don't realize it yet.\"\n\nTrying to find a silver lining, Kimmel said, \"we've been through this once before\" referring to Trump's first term. \"And yes, this time it is probably going to be worse, maybe a lot worse. But I also think that maybe we will look back and realize that, in the long run, this is what we needed to wake us up. Maybe the people who care so much about him need to find out how little he cares about them.\"\n\nKimmel also poked a bit of fun at former President Joe Biden in his remarks.\n\nWhat did Trump say about Jimmy Kimmel's show cancellation?\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social in response to the news about the show, calling it \"great news for America.\"\n\n\"Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" the post wrote. \"Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"\n\nCBS announced in July it was canceling \"The Late Show\" with Colbert in May 2026. The network said it was a financial decision, though other late-night hosts and critics have been skeptical of that reasoning, given Colbert's criticism of Trump.\n\nJimmy Fallon joked on his show after the 2024 election, \"America decided to get back with a crazy ex.\" His contract with NBCUniversal is up in 2028. Seth Meyers is also a frequent critic of Trump and his \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" contract is up in 2028.\n\nTrump also addressed the news at a press conference in the United Kingdom on Sept. 18:\n\n\"Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings, more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,\" Trump said. \"Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. You can call that free speech or not. He was fired for lack of talent.\"\n\nKimmel's ratings are second-highest among late-night hosts after Colbert, but late-night TV ratings are down overall as a genre.\n\nWhat did Jimmy Kimmel say about Trump and Charlie Kirk?\n\nDuring his opening monologue on Monday, Sept. 15, Kimmel said the following:\n\n\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was, uh, grieving. On Friday, the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this.\"\n\nThe clip then shows a video of Trump talking to reporters. He was asked how he was doing, personally, following the death of his ally Kirk. Trump responded, \"I think very good,\" before diverting attention to construction of the White House ballroom Trump is having built.\n\nKimmel continues after the clip of Trump:\n\n\"Yes, he's at the fourth stage of grief: construction. Demolition, construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend; this is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish, OK? And it didn't just happen once,\"\n\nKimmel played another clip of Trump talking on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" saying he was meeting with the ballroom's architects when he found out Kirk was shot.\n\n\"And then we installed the most beautiful chandelier...you, sconces you wouldn't believe. There's something wrong with him, there really is. I mean, who thinks like that, and why are we building a $200 million ballroom in the White House? Is it possible that he's doing it intentionally so he can be bad about that instead of the (Jeffrey) Epstein list? …\"\n\nTrump has targeted, sued media companies in second term\n\nTrump has long decried the news media as \"fake news,\" and has continued legal attacks on major media outlets since winning the White House back. But he has long filed lawsuits against the media that do not amount to anything.
