The leaders fought over tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nThe G7 summit changes hands annually, and it just so happens to be Canada’s turn to host again this week. Canadian leaders have signaled that they're keen to avoid the disarray that defined the gathering in 2018 and have worked to minimize any outward appearance of division.\n\nTrump has often been a disruptor at global gatherings, badgering U.S. allies and competitors alike. But a conflict that erupted last week between Israel and Iran over Tehran’s illicit nuclear program could change the dynamic, as the U.S. president flies to the foothills of the Rockies for the G7 summit.\n\nThe president could use his time in Kananaskis to unite his international colleagues behind solutions in the Middle East.\n\n“Trump wants some kind of deescalation,” said Josh Lipsky, a G7 organizer for former President Barack Obama who chairs the international economics program at the Atlantic Council. “That's what all the leaders around the table want. So there's an avenue here where Trump plays a more traditional role.”\n\nWhat will happen at the G7 summit?\n\nIsrael and Iran will be front-and-center at the summit, after the countries launched additional missile attacks on the eve of the event.\n\nThe volley comes after nuclear talks between American and Iranian negotiators that had been scheduled to take place on June 15 were canceled, despite a focused effort from Trump to keep them on track.\n\nHe told Tehran in social media posts and interviews with American journalists that a reinvigorated agreement was the only diplomatic offramp.\n\nOvernight, he offered to play a mediating role in the conflict that could engulf a region already on edge by fighting between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!\" Trump said on Truth Social early the morning of June 15.\n\nInstead of focusing on global financial issues or security concerns about China and Russia, the missile exchanges in the Middle East will naturally take up a larger portion of the G7 discussion, said Kelly Ann Shaw, who was Trump’s representative to the economic club in the latter part of his first term.\n\n“There's going to be a tremendous amount of concern about this exploding into a much broader regional conflict and what that means for every country participating in the G7,” she said.\n\nTrump has been laying the groundwork to play peacemaker: Ahead of the summit, Trump spoke to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about the conflict and Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country was kicked out of the informal gathering after it annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\n“He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end,” Trump said of his hour-long conversation with Putin June 14.\n\nRussia helped facilitate a previous deal to curtail Iran’s uranium program, which Trump pulled the United States out of in his first term.\n\nIn a nod to how much the fighting between Israel and Iran is upending the regular international order, Trump said he and Putin spent “much less time” on the phone talking about the Russian leader’s assault on Ukraine.\n\nCanada as the 51st state? Trump says 'highly unlikely' US uses military force to annex country\n\n“That will be for next week,” Trump said, referring to a NATO Summit that will bring America and its military allies together in late June in the Netherlands.\n\nBut G7 leaders won't only talk about Iran and Israel. After all, tariffs are one of the main issues agitating Trump and his counterparts during his second-chance presidency.\n\nSince 2018, Trump has expanded his tariff regime, and they've become a centerpiece of his second term. Trade dealing could be on the table with Canada, the European Union and more.\n\nThe president has advocated for the United States to absorb its northern neighbor – the host of the summit. And leaders still plan to discuss topics such as artificial intelligence and wildfire management.\n\nHow will talks on tariffs, peacemaking play out?\n\nOf the group that attended the last G7 Summit in Canada, only Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron remain in power. The leaders of the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy have all turned over since Trump was last in office.\n\nGone is a typically long winded and hard-fought communique that every country has to agree to. Canada worked with G7 nations to come up with short, action-oriented leader statements on areas of common interest, a senior U.S. official said.\n\n“I think it's a more pragmatic approach, frankly,” Shaw, the former Trump aide, assessed. “And it really does get the G7 refocused on what it's supposed to be doing – which is talking about the most pressing issues of the day and trying to find a common ground and coordinated approach among some of the world's largest economies.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will encourage nations to “stand together,” the country's ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, said, in addition to working through issues in a mutually supportive way.\n\n“That’s going to be his main message to all of the leaders: build a coalition of like-minded countries that share values, that believe in international cooperation, believe in free and open exchange of ideas, of goods, of services, of the technologies that keep us all strong together and safe and secure,” she said.\n\nStill, the American president’s tariffs are a challenge for G7 nations. A partial reprieve he offered most countries and the EU expires next month. He’s in the midst of negotiating deals with several participating countries, including Japan and Canada. He said he reached an agreement with the UK in May.\n\nA senior U.S. official said Trump was eager to pursue his trade goals and take part in working sessions at the G7 on migrants and drug smuggling, in addition to other topics.\n\nHillman said there’s no denying that countries are feeling the impact of Trump’s tariffs. “Those are issues I'm sure that the president will want to talk to leaders about, and leaders will want to exchange their views, as well,\" she said.\n\nYet, Trump will be hard-pressed to play the role of peacemaker, after boasting, repeatedly, that existing conflicts would not have started had he won a second term in 2020.\n\nAnd while tariffs are likely to come up in individual sit-downs, world leaders were already aiming to avoid a public clash with Trump like the one that unfolded in the infamous 2018 photo, Lipsky said.\n\nThey have a very clear objective this time, he added, which has not always been the case.\n\n“You have the leaders of the world's largest advanced democracies in one room,\" Lipsky said. \"And if they can't coordinate on some signal to both the Israelis and the Iranians, then they'll never be able to do it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/15"}]}

The infections marked the first known human-ape transmission.\n\nSan Diego Zoo and Safari Park (Image credit: Daniel Knighton/Getty Images)\n\n‘Unprecedented’ jab\n\nWhile “vaccines for humans require expensive development programmes and large scale trials”, said The Scientist, “animal vaccines commonly require a lower level of scrutiny, and often have a different make-up”. And “there is precedent for jabs that can be used on multiple species, so some veterinary pharmaceutical companies have sought to develop a Covid-19 shot that can be used to vaccinate many different types of animal”.\n\nGorillas, bonobos and orangutans were among the first creatures to receive the Zoetis vaccine, which has now been used to inoculate dozens of different species in a handful of zoos across the US.\n\n“It’s unprecedented that we have one vaccine with one adjuvant that has been used in over 100 species without significant issues,” said microbiologist Mahesh Kumar, a senior vice president of Zoetis.\n\nAnd the size of the vaccine dose does not need to be adjusted depending on the size or weight of the recipient animal, with “the exact same quantity” used regardless of whether the creature is “a 500lb gorilla and a 5lb mink”, Kumar told the magazine.\n\nSimilar to Novavax\n\nThe experimental vaccine works in a similar way to the Novavax jab, which was greenlit for adults aged 18 and over by the European Medicines Agency this week.\n\nInstead of using a snippet of genetic material called messenger RNA (mRNA) like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, or a viral vector like the Johnson & Johnson version, or a live virus, the Zoetis jab “uses synthetic spike proteins to trigger the same antibodies the live virus would”, said National Geographic.\n\nCovid deaths in animal\n\nAlthough Covid has been detected in various species, from white-tailed deer and domestic cats to hippos and hyenas, the virus has claimed few animal lives.\n\n(Image credit: David Silverman/Getty Images)\n\nIn June, two lions died after testing positive at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Forbes reported that ten other lions were also infected, “suggesting that big cats in zoological facilities may be more vulnerable to the coronavirus than previously thought”.\n\nBut while a 17-year old tigress at a Swedish zoo “had to be euthanised after contracting” Covid, there were “no other confirmed instances” of a big cat dying from the disease, the magazine said.\n\nCovid cases among animals to date have mainly been confined to carnivorans – meat-eating animals such as wolves, hyenas, cats and dogs. However, experts say that until more data is available, the jury is still out on whether carnivorans are more susceptible.\n\n‘First in line’ for jabs\n\nZoos “will make their own judgements” about which species to priorities for Covid vaccines, according to The Scientist. But “big cats and gorillas” are likely to be “first in line”.\n\nArguments have also been made for vaccinating endangered species against Covid-19. And while there has been “little evidence of pet-to-human transmission”, added the magazine, concerns have also raised about urban monkeys that “sometimes interact with people at very close quarters, including in many large cities in Asia and South America”.\n\nMutations of the virus “could come back into the human population”, said Kevin Tyler, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia.\n\nThe Guardian reported in February that EU disease and food safety experts feared that mink farms could also pose a “Covid risk to humans and wildlife”. As of January, the virus had been found at 400 mink farms in at least eight countries in Europe, including 290 in Denmark.\n\n(Image credit: Kit MacAvoy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nEU health bosses called for regular testing of staff and animals at the fur farms – a call echoed by the World Health Organization.\n\nVaccine maker Zoetis is hoping to get its experimental vaccine approved for use in mink, amid continuing concerns that mink-related variants of the virus might prolong the pandemic.\n\nIn October, local authorities in Finland were granted permission to vaccinate the country’s entire mink population against Covid-19, using a domestically produced jab.

The resulting jabs rollout has been “faster than any other country in the Americas”, triggering hopes of Chile becoming “among the first in the world to reach herd immunity”, reports The New York Times (NYT).\n\nHowever, “the numbers don’t tell the full story”, says openDemocracy.\n\nChile is using two vaccines, the Chinese-developed CoronaVac and the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is being widely used in Europe. The majority of the vaccines administered in Chile have been the CoronaVac, which “studies show offers only 50% effective protection against infection”, the news and analysis site continues.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn other words, “out of 100 people vaccinated with two doses of CoronaVac, half of them remain at risk to be infected by the virus”.\n\nDespite this relatively low level of efficacy compared with the leading Western-developed Covid jabs, Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera began reopening the country in January, when the vaccine campaign was in its infancy.\n\nExperts say this early easing of restrictions “lulled people into thinking that the worst of the pandemic was over and dropping their guard”, The Times reports - with disastrous results.\n\nSince then, “deaths have climbed over 100 a day for the first time since June”, says The Telegraph. With case rates continuing to rise, Pinera has been forced into an about turn, announcing “a new lockdown covering 80% of the population and including the capital, Santiago”, the paper adds.\n\nThe tightening of the rules comes as the surge leaves “intensive-care units operating with few beds to spare and the system at a breaking point”, says the NYT.\n\n‘Cautionary tale’\n\nThe new lockdown restrictions have seen the government “shut down local markets and advised residents to use food delivery services”, Al Jazeera reports. But many Chileans are concerned about not being able to work after a year of unstable conditions.\n\n“There’s so much uncertainty, you don’t know what’s going to happen from one day to the next,” Nilda Bravo, a 63-year-old housekeeper, told the broadcaster. “There’s no money, as there’s no work, so how can we pay extra for someone to bring us food?”\n\nPresident Pinera has committed to continuing to provide support handouts that range from $33 (£23.83) to $135 (£97.48) a month per person, depending on the time spent in lockdown. But “the social security measures do not provide sufficient support - raising concerns about how they will survive another strict lockdown”, Al Jazeera adds.\n\nMeanwhile, health experts had warned that unlocking the country too quickly once again would create a “a false sense of security” and “a sharp spike in new infections and deaths that is overloading the health care system”, the NYT says.\n\nIn January, Chileans were allowed to travel domestically, with schools reopening their doors in March. The government has also been welcoming holidaymakers from abroad since November last year, raising the spectre of new variants being brought in from neighbouring South American nations that are also battling high levels of Covid infections.\n\nEvents in Chile are being closely watched by the UK’s most senior medical experts. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty told the Downing Street daily press briefing yesterday that “we absolutely need to learn from those countries that are far ahead of us or alongside us in terms of vaccine rollout”.\n\nCiting Israel and Chile, Whitty said that “this is the reason we want to do things in a steady way”. Chile “is quite a good corrective” to “the assumption that just because you vaccinate lots of people then the problem goes away”, he added.\n\nAs the crisis continues to prove his point, President Pinera has asked Chile’s Congress to delay a vote scheduled for early April to elect the representatives who will draft a new national constitution. In a statement last week, Pinera said that “protecting the health of our compatriots has always been our first priority”.\n\nAll the same, Chile’s surging case rates and overwhelmed hospitals will serve as a “cautionary tale for other nations looking to vaccination drives to quickly put an end to the era of beleaguered economies, closed borders and social distancing”, says the NYT.", "authors": ["Joe Evans"], "publish_date": "2021/04/06"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/955243/do-antidepressants-work", "title": "Do antidepressants work? | The Week", "text": "Doctors should focus on prescribing antidepressants to people with “severe depression” rather than more moderate or mild symptoms, given uncertainties over their effectiveness, a new study has found.\n\nThe review, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)’s Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, suggests a “more cautious prescribing practice – with antidepressants given to fewer patients, for shorter periods of time”.\n\nThe BMJ paper weighed up the uncertain evidence for the medication’s effectiveness with the possibility of “severe and long-lasting withdrawal symptoms” – including anxiety, insomnia, depression and changes to appetite – concluding that “widespread long-term use of antidepressants is probably inappropriate”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

One of the most influential fashion designers of the 20th century, Quant, who has died aged 93, is most closely associated with the miniskirt.\n\nShe did not invent it (André Courrèges might lay claim to that), but it was she who took it mainstream. She also gave it its name, in honour of her favourite car, the Mini Cooper – and in her hands the miniskirt became emblematic of “life in the fast lane”.\n\nIts hemline was shocking, said Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell in The Atlantic; but the miniskirt was not really meant to be sexy. For Quant, the main point was not to bare women’s legs – it was to liberate them from the “long skirts, stockings, garters, girdles and petticoats” of the 1950s. As she put it, a woman should be able to run to catch a bus. Her miniskirts were paired with flat shoes, not heels, and the wearer’s legs were usually encased in plastic boots, or brightly coloured tights (which she sourced from theatrical costumers).\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

As Quant put it, the miniskirt “celebrated life and tremendous opportunity”.\n\nUntil the 1950s, few clothes were designed specifically for young people. Women were expected to emulate their mothers, with their twinsets and lacquered hair. Abhorring this adult world, Quant decided to do things differently, and in the “spirit of the time”, she broke every rule in the process. She used “formal fabrics for casual clothes, winter fabric for summer styles, menswear textiles for womenswear”, and introduced industrial elements such as vinyl and PVC.\n\nMary Quant exhibition at the V&A (Image credit: Nicky J Sims / Stringer)\n\nHer clothes – bright, colourful and simple – were not cheap, but they were accessible; and her lines were constantly being replaced, in a precursor to today’s fast fashion. Like Coco Chanel, she designed the clothes she wanted to wear, and she was the best advert for her brand: young, quirky, hardworking, fun, and instantly recognisable, with her slight physique and angular Vidal Sassoon five-point bob.\n\n“Vidal put the top on it,” she’d say. Within a decade of opening her first shop, in 1955, she had become a global brand, said The New York Times. For her contribution to British exports, she was appointed OBE in 1966, the same year as she wrote her bestselling memoir, Quant by Quant.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n‘Cavalier girl’\n\nBarbara Mary Quant was born in Blackheath, south London, in 1930. Her parents, John and Mildred (née Jones) were both teachers who had come from mining families, and who were anxious that their two children, Mary and Tony, should pursue conventional careers. But Mary had been interested in designing clothes since early childhood: one of her earliest memories was of lying in bed with measles aged six, and cutting up the bedspread to make a dress. Asked at her boarding school in Kent to choose between the Roundheads and the Cavaliers, “I came down strongly on the side of the Cavaliers, as they were more chic,” she said.\n\nHer parents were appalled when she said she wanted to go to art college, said The Independent, but agreed, if she promised to take an art teacher’s diploma. She won a place at Goldsmiths, and it was there that she met her future husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene, a tall, debonair aristocrat who was prone to wandering around the college clutching a trumpet or a lily.\n\nThey first met at a fancy dress ball; she was wearing “black mesh tights and strategically placed balloons”, he was clad in his mother’s gold silk pyjama top and prune drainpipes. The attraction was instantaneous, and despite their different social backgrounds, they became inseparable. Quant was naturally shy, but she shared his love of fun and pranks. “Let’s be bad,” he’d tell her. Once, he painted buttons onto his chest, instead of putting on a shirt. In her memoir, she recalled that passersby were infuriated: “God, look at this Modern Youth!” they’d sneer. The couple took this baton and ran with it, said Anna Murphy in The Times. As they were preparing to go out, they’d ask each other: “Shall we be Modern Youth tonight?”\n\nMary Quant and Alexander Plunket Greene in 1966 (Image credit: Dove / Stringer)\n\nOn leaving college, Quant took a job at a milliner’s in Mayfair, but soon decided that she didn’t want to spend weeks working on a single hat, and that the future lay in mass production. Plunket Greene had inherited £5,000 when he was 21, and in 1955 they used the money to open a boutique-cum-restaurant on the King’s Road, with Archie McNair, a former solicitor who became the financial brain behind the Quant global empire. Thanks in part to Plunket Greene’s marketing genius, Bazaar was a sensation.\n\nInitially, Quant stocked it with acquired merchandise; when she couldn’t find the kinds of clothes she wanted, she started to design them herself on her kitchen table. In the 1960s, she adopted her famous daisy logo – redolent of her belief that clothes should be fun, playful, childlike even. (She designed her skinny-rib sweaters after putting on a jumper owned by an eight-year-old boy.)\n\n‘Miniskirts and hot pants’\n\nThe shop, with its outlandish mannequin displays and loud music, attracted the ire of some Londoners: she recalled that on the day it opened, bowler-hatted men struck its windows with their furled umbrellas. But stock sold out faster than she could resupply it, said The Times. John Lennon and Brigitte Bardot were among the stars who visited; Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy got dressed in her changing rooms, then strutted down the catwalk that was the King’s Road; George Harrison and Pattie Boyd married in Quant furs.\n\nIt was her customers, she said, who really designed the miniskirt. “I wore them very short but [they’d] say, ‘shorter, shorter’.” Later, she introduced hot pants to the world. By 1963, the Quant label had gone mass market as the Ginger Group. It stocked 2,000 stores in the US and Quant began commuting monthly to New York.\n\nIn 1966, she created her own line of make-up. Hugely successful, her cosmetics had typically playful names, such as Jeepers Peepers eye shadow, Starkers foundation and Bring Back the Lash mascara. In the 1970s, she expanded into stationery, textiles and home furnishings. There was even a Mary Quant doll.\n\nQuant started to wind down her role in the business in the late 1980s, after Plunket Greene was given two years to live. He was a heavy drinker and a womaniser, and their marriage had been tempestuous. But after his death, in 1990, she said that “I have never stopped loving him”. Her later partner, Antony Rouse, died in 2014. She is survived by Orlando, the son from her marriage.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/21"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/technology/953937/milk-crate-challenge-viral-dangerous", "title": "Why doctors are issuing warnings over viral Milk Crate Challenge ...", "text": "Social media challenges are known for being bizarre, from the Planking Challenge where participants lie face-down in a busy or unusual area, to the Mannequin Challenge, where a group of people pose frozen like statues as a camera moves between them. But the latest challenge to go viral on social media is not just bizarre – it’s dangerous, say doctors.\n\nThe Milk Crate Challenge started life on TikTok, with its origin thought to be a June 2011 video entitled “Guy Falls Off 6 Milk Crates”, the Washington Post reported. In this challenge, participants “take on a set of milk crates precariously stacked in the shape of a pyramid, attempt to climb to the top and then back down again without toppling over”, said The Guardian.\n\nVideos of people attempting the Milk Crate Challenge – often with what the Washington Post described as “catastrophic results” – have been watched and shared by millions across various social media platforms. “It’s the biggest thing that’s going on in every neighbourhood right now,” a New York State resident told the same paper. “You go to any park or public place right now and you’ll see crates there.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Health facilities around the US have reported seeing increasing numbers of people with serious injuries related to the challenge, including two patients in Atlanta who had broken bones and one in New Jersey who had suffered several fractured ribs after falling off the crates, People magazine reported.\n\nNow doctors and health officials are urging people to stop taking part in such challenges, where the most dangerous attempts are rewarded with the most “likes”, views and shares. “Everyone needs to do their part in supporting first responders and health-care providers”, a New York-based orthopaedic surgeon told the Washington Post. “That involves not partaking in challenges [which put] additional strain on the system”.\n\nAnd on Monday, the Baltimore City Health Department tweeted: “With Covid-19 hospitalizations rising around the country, please check with your local hospital to see if they have a bed available for you, before attempting the #milkcratechallenge.”\n\nThe Milk Crate Challenge follows in the footsteps of similarly risky dares including the Blackout Challenge, “where young people are encouraged to hold their breath until they pass out”, and the Benadryl Challenge, “where young people intentionally consume large amounts of the antihistamine to induce hallucinations”, said The Guardian.\n\nIn a statement released to People on Wednesday, a TikTok spokesperson said that the app “prohibits content that promotes or glorifies dangerous acts” and that such videos are removed, with searches redirected to the platform’s community guidelines. “We encourage everyone to exercise caution in their behaviour whether online or off,” the statement added.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/958696/how-tiktok-conquered-the-world", "title": "How TikTok conquered the world | The Week", "text": "In the five years since TikTok launched, the mobile phone app once regarded as a teen dance fad has ballooned into one of the most dominant – and politically controversial – media platforms in the world.\n\nIt has grown past one billion active users faster than any other social network: it has about 17 million users in the UK, more than 130 million in the US, 99 million in Indonesia and 74 million in Brazil; users are expected to top 1.8 billion by the end of the year.\n\nIt sucks people into an infinite stream of content, for hours on end – so much so that the company has had to implement warnings about screen time and reminders for people to “take a break” or, failing that, just to “get some water”.

In 2016, a tech firm, ByteDance – set up in 2012 by two young Beijing-based software engineers, Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo – launched a similar service, Douyin, which acquired Musical.ly and merged the two in 2018. Douyin is still the Chinese version of TikTok. The two share an interface, but have no access to each other’s content.\n\nTikTok has long faced scrutiny from US lawmakers, who have questioned its exploitation of user data. In 2020, a US national security panel ordered ByteDance to sell the US TikTok service because of fears that US user data could be passed on to the Chinese government. US lawmakers and TikTok are now negotiating a plan, under which it would change its data security and governance without requiring a sale.\n\nByteDance, which bills itself as primarily an AI company, recorded $18.3bn in revenue during the first three months of 2022. According to Forbes, Zhang Yiming is worth $49bn and is China’s second-richest person. TikTok faces competition, though: YouTube has launched a successful copycat version, YouTube Shorts.\n\nByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming is thought to be worth $49bn (Image credit: VCG/Contributor/Getty Images)\n\nHow does it work?\n\nTikTok is an app for sharing short video clips made by other users, varying from 15 seconds to a maximum of ten minutes, though the average is under a minute. The videos play on a loop; users navigate their feed in the app by scrolling up and down. The key difference between it and, say, Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is that you don’t have to search for the subjects or celebrities you’re interested in, or link up with friends.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe “For You” page simply starts showing you a never-ending stream of TikToks. The more it learns about you, the more the feed becomes streamlined towards not what you say you would like to watch, but what you actually watch (though you can still search for your interests, or follow people whose content you enjoy).\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nIts machine-learning algorithm gathers data about your tastes every second you watch, pause or scroll, tailoring your feed accordingly. In this sense, says The New York Times, “TikTok is more machine than man”.\n\nWhat are TikTok videos like?\n\nTikTok started with dancing and lip-syncing – music has always been central – but its content has ballooned to cover just about any subject you can imagine. Videos of beauty and styling tutorials are popular, as are cooking videos and, of course, videos of cute animals and babies. A video of “Mia the cat” successfully navigating a path laid over upturned paper cups, set to the Mission: Impossible theme tune, has been viewed almost 200 million times.\n\nHowever, the hashtags used to mark and filter content range from #fishtok (content about fishing, 16 billion views), to #cleantok (57 billion), #farmtok (8 billion) and #medievaltiktok (4 billion). #booktok (92 billion) – videos of people enjoying or talking about books – supposedly boosted the publishing industry to one of its best years ever in 2021.\n\nHow do people make videos?\n\nTikTok makes it very easy to create them, with a toolkit of camera effects, editing tools, augmented-reality filters and, crucially, a massive library of audio clips. These range from snippets of popular songs that have sparked dance trends to audio from TV and films. Users also use the “green screen” feature to, for instance, commentate on another video as a “response”, or create a “duet” by adding themselves alongside another video.\n\nThe app provides extensive prompts and ideas for your content. You can participate in dare-like challenges, copy a dance, or make fun of anybody else doing the same. Popular content creators make money through advertising deals, creator payouts from TikTok, and by receiving TikTok “coins” – the network’s virtual currency – from fans. In the three months to October, “TikTokers” spent $900m inside the app.\n\nTikTok content has ballooned to cover just about any subject you can imagine (Image credit: Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nWho is watching TikTok?\n\nTwo-thirds of US teens use the app, and one in six say they are on it “almost constantly”. The average American TikTok viewer spends 80 minutes a day on it; that’s more than users spend on Facebook and Instagram combined. In the UK, Ofcom says that TikTok reaches 66% of 15-24-year-olds, and that adult users, on average, spend almost an hour on TikTok each day. It is also, along with Instagram and YouTube, one of the UK’s most popular news sources for teens.\n\nBut it’s not just teenagers who use it: half of US users are over 25. In short, it is vastly important for advertising, and is capable of creating viral hits and stars overnight.\n\nWhy is it so addictive?\n\nObviously the content is entertaining. But the design of the app helps to make it addictive, too. Engagement with TikTok is predominantly passive. Few decisions are required: watching the next TikTok involves only a simple flick of the finger. As investment analysts at Bernstein Research pointed out, TikTok has replaced “the friction of deciding what to watch” with a “sensory rush of bite-sized videos… delivering endorphin hit after hit”.\n\n“Every swipe could bring something better,” says The Washington Post, “but viewers don’t know when they’ll get it, so they keep swiping in anticipation of something they might never find.”\n\n“Once immersed in the flow-like state, users may experience a distorted sense of time in which they do not realise how much time has passed,” noted a researcher from Brown University.\n\nShould we be worried about TikTok?\n\nAs with other social media, TikTok has raised many concerns. Its use has been associated with adverse health impacts such as anxiety, depression or poor sleeping habits; it has also been accused of shrinking users’ attention span.\n\nThe sheer size of TikTok’s audience and influence means that there has been concern about its content, from misinformation to obscenity to censorship: the system by which content is suppressed or promoted is opaque.\n\nByteDance has tried to allay such fears by being increasingly transparent about how its algorithms work – an unusual move in an industry where code is often top secret. But it does not help that it is run from a totalitarian state that leads the world in digital surveillance.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/954612/princess-haya-sheikh-mohammed-dubai-legal-battle", "title": "The legal fight between Princess Haya and Sheikh Mohammed ...", "text": "Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has been ordered to pay around £550m to his former wife and their two children in what could amount to the largest award of its kind ordered by an English court.\n\nThe massive payout was awarded to Princess Haya, who has a son and daughter with the prime minister of the United Arab Emirate, in order to “protect them from the threat” Sheikh Mohammed poses to them, The Guardian said.\n\nIn a written judgment, Mr Justice Moor said that “uniquely” the “main threat they face is from HH (his highness the sheikh) himself not from outside sources”, adding that this is “compounded by the full weight of the state that he has available to him”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Dubai ruler, also vice-president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), reportedly has 23 children by different wives.\n\nIn early 2019, the princess fled Dubai with her two children. She was reported to be fearful for her life after beginning an affair with her British bodyguard.\n\nShe initially fled to Germany but now lives in an £85m townhouse in Kensington Palace Gardens, near the home of Prince William and Kate Middleton. The Jordanian embassy made Haya a senior diplomat in October 2019, granting her diplomatic immunity and protection, as well as the right to remain in the UK.\n\nHaya, now 47, is the third female member of her husband’s court “to apparently try to run away”, the BBC reported after she fled to London.\n\nIn 2000, four years before Haya married the sheikh, one of his daughters fled from her family while at their holiday home in Surrey. Sheikha Shamsa, then 19, was abducted and returned home two months later. She has not been seen in public since.\n\nHer sister, Latifa, also tried to flee from the UAE in 2018, on a boat, but the vessel was intercepted by commandos off the coast of India. She was returned to Dubai and has also not been seen in public since.\n\nAfter Haya fled in 2019, Sheikh Mohammed divorced her under sharia law and applied to London’s High Court for the return of his children. The judge rejected the request.\n\n‘Walls are closing in’\n\nDuring court hearings in October, the princess said she has been “beset by threats and pressures” since leaving Dubai more than two years ago, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAccording to the paper, her lawyers successfully managed to extend an existing non-molestation order (a type of injunction often sought by domestic abuse victims) that “banned the sheikh or his associates from a 100-metre exclusion zone” around her Berkshire bolthole, Castlewood mansion.\n\nThe injunction also reportedly upheld “a 1,000ft no-fly zone above it to protect her and blocked any purchase of the 77-acre estate”.\n\n“The prospect of Sheikh Mohammed, or those on his behalf buying the properties around Castlewood is terrifying and utterly wearing,” Haya was said to have testified. “It feels like the walls are closing in on me. I feel like I am defending myself against a whole ‘state’.”\n\nA senior High Court judge ruled earlier this year that Sheikh Mohammed had used Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of the princess and five of her associates, including two of her lawyers.\n\nIn a “damning” judgment made in May but not published until early October, Haya’s phone was found to have been hacked 11 times in July and August last year with Sheikh Mohammed’s “express or implied authority”, The Guardian reported.\n\nJudge Andrew McFarlane, chair of the Family Justice Council, said the hacking occurred during “a particularly busy and financially interesting time” in the ongoing divorce custody case between the Sheikh and his estranged wife.\n\nSheikh Mohammed was not present in court during the hearing and has denied the hacking allegations. “As a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters,” he said in a statement.\n\nWhile the allegations are “embarrassing” for the sheikh, said BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, his “sovereign immunity from any future potential prosecution” means “there is little or no prospect of his ever having to face any police questioning”.\n\nRecord settlement\n\nThe £550m payout intended to “cover the costs of security for Haya’s lifetime” will be “paid upfront rather than annually as it would otherwise create a situation whereby it was in her ex-husband’s interests to reduce the payments”, The Guardian said.\n\nPrincess Haya “did not ask for any money for herself in the proceedings, other than to compensate for items including jewellery and clothes that she lost as a result of the marital breakdown”.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Sheikh Mohammed will be forced to “make a one-off payment of £251.5m within three months to Haya for the upkeep of her mansions in the UK”, Sky News reported, as well as “£3m towards the education” of his children.\n\nAll of the funds will be guaranteed through a £290m security held by HSBC bank.\n\nThe final sum is “less than half of the £1.4b that Haya had originally wanted”, the broadcaster said, “despite being described by some London lawyers to be the largest public award ever ordered by an English family court”.\n\nA spokesperson for the sheikh said after the hearing: “He has always ensured that his children are provided for. The court has now made its ruling on finances and he does not intend to comment further.\n\n“He asks that the media respect the privacy of his children and do not intrude into their lives in the UK.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/28"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/958640/vdv-russias-elite-armed-forces", "title": "VDV: who are Russia's elite airborne force? | The Week", "text": "Vladimir Putin is sending his elite airborne troops into the eastern Donbas region in a bid to repel the Ukrainian counteroffensive, British defence chiefs believe.\n\nAccording to the latest intelligence update by the Ministry of Defence(MoD), the Kremlin “has likely redeployed major elements of the VDV (airborne forces) to the Donetsk and Luhansk fronts” following the Russian retreat from the southern city of Kherson.\n\nRussian generals are now believed to be focused on preventing “a breakthrough by Ukrainian forces on the front line between Kremina and Svatove”, reported the London Evening Standard.

The elite paratroopers are distinguished by their blue berets and white-and-blue striped undershirts and have a “fearsome reputation for toughness and unflinching violence”, said The Telegraph’s Moscow correspondent James Kilner.\n\nThe VDV has “a distinctive culture and esprit de corps”, agreed Janes. But while the crack unit “is a fixture of parades and military open days”, said the open-source intelligence company, “it has long suffered from a tension in its roles”. From “Afghanistan to Chechnya”, VDV paratroopers have “repeatedly” been “pressed into service as light infantry because they had the toughness and willingness to act with the initiative that a mission demanded”.\n\nThe unit also served in the Balkans and in the 2014 Russian intervention in Ukraine’s Donbas region.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat role has the unit had in the Ukraine war?\n\nVDV forces, which are denoted by “V” marks on their vehicles, have not fared well in the conflict triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUK defence officials said in May that the VDV had been involved in “several notable tactical failures” since the conflict began. These included an attempted advance on Kyiv via Hostomel Airfield and “failed and costly crossings” of the Seversky Donets River, reported Newsweek\n\nAnd an entire VDV mechanised patrol was ambushed and destroyed by Ukrainian special operators in the Kyiv suburb of Irpin in March.\n\nThat month also saw the death of Colonel Sergei Sukharev, who commanded a VDV unit “considered elite in its own right”, the 331st Guards Parachute Regiment, said Business Insider.\n\nThe losses triggered questions about VDV’s tactics in Ukraine. In the “shattered neighbourhoods” around Kyiv, the Russian paratroopers were “outmatched by the Ukrainians”, wrote the BBC’s defence editor Mark Urban. Given that the defenders were in many cases “simply local defence units or reservists,” Urban added, “that speaks to a basic failure in the VDV’s system of training and recruitment.”\n\nIn another humiliation, VDV forces were part of the failed Russian defence of Kherson. Russian forces withdrew ignominiously from the southern city earlier this month because the area had become too difficult to resupply.\n\nWhat next for the VDV?\n\nRussian hopes that the VDV can bounce back from recent setbacks are unlikely to have been boosted by claims that the unit’s ranks are being watered down. The latest briefing from the UK’s MoD said that “some VDV units have likely been reinforced with mobilised reservists” and that “these poorly trained personnel” would dilute the regiment’s “supposedly elite capability”.\n\nThe ministry added that “potential operational tasks for the VDV include supporting the defence of the Kremina-Svatove area in Luhansk Oblast or reinforcing offensive operations against the Donetsk Oblast town of Bakhmut”.\n\nWhether the VDV can restore its reputation through success in such operations could significant impact the outcome of the war.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}]}

After the Mass, Francis' coffin was placed on an open-air popemobile and transported to the burial site outside the Vatican by a motorcade that traversed the streets of Rome, lined by cheering crowds.\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91, who presided over the funeral, lauded Francis in his homily as \"a pope among the people, with an open heart toward everyone.\"\n\n\"He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalized,\" he said.\n\nThe Mass began with readings from the Scripture after Francis' simple wooden coffin, adorned by a large cross, was carried into the square by white-gloved pallbearers. Applause echoed through the square as bells tolled.\n\nSome mourners had camped out overnight to secure a spot. \"We have been waiting all night,\" Maria Fierro of Spain said. \"Accompanying (Francis) in his last moments is very emotional.\"\n\nJames Mary, a Franciscan nun, said she had been \"up the whole night. We want to say goodbye because he (was a) living saint, very humble and simple.\"\n\nFrancis, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, died Easter Monday at 88 from a stroke, weeks after battling back from respiratory ailments. On Easter Sunday, the frail but resolute pope − who championed the poor and marginalized and was often called \"the people's pope\" − thrilled crowds with an impromptu popemobile outing into St. Peter's Square.\n\nThe Argentine pope, who contended with Catholic Church traditionalists opposed to his reforms, was known for his warm demeanor and for spurning any kind of grandeur: Living at a guesthouse in the Vatican, taking public transportation, wearing plain white cassocks. On his U.S. trip in 2015, he zipped around the nation's capital in a small black Fiat.\n\nFrancis, who scaled back rules for papal funeral rites a year ago, made sure his own service and burial reflected that same message of simplicity − breaking from tradition even in death.\n\nFrancis’ native Buenos Aires honors hometown priest with Mass\n\nBefore he became Pope Francis, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was the archbishop of his hometown Buenos Aires. On April 26, Argentina’s capital city held an outdoor Mass remembering their humble priest after his official funeral in Rome, some 6,900 miles away across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThousands took to the streets in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Buenos Aires, which stands along the central Plaza de Mayo near the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Francis, who came from a middle-class neighborhood in Buenos Aires, became known as the Jesuit priest who rode the city's public transit and was a card-carrying fan of his hometown soccer club.\n\n“He was a common man among us, just another porteño,” someone from Buenos Aires, Jorge Macri, the city’s chief of government, wrote in an op-ed titled “La ciudad de Francisco,” the city of Francis, in the newspaper La Nación. Macri said Francis “moved around by bus or subway, always on hand, always with the watchful eye of a pastor who knows his flock.”\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nPope Francis buried in private ceremony\n\nPope Francis has been laid to rest in a private, religious ceremony within the Basilica of St. Mary Major on Saturday afternoon, according to Vatican News.\n\nThe Rite of the Burial of the Roman Pontiff's casket was attended by Catholic leaders and Francis' family members, Vatican News said.\n\nHis coffin arrived at the basilica after a procession watched by thousands lining the street. It was greeted by 40 members of communities Francis uplifted during his papacy: people experiencing homelessness, migrants, prisoners and transgender people, the Associated Press reported. Four children placed white roses on his coffin.\n\nOver a quarter million gather for Mass at St. Peter's Square\n\nMore than a quarter-million people gathered in St. Peter’s Square for Pope Francis’ funeral, according to Vatican News.\n\nAbout 250 cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops and priests, as well as consecrated religious and lay people joined Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals, as he delivered the liturgy, the Vatican’s news agency said.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nProcession through Rome includes open-air popemobile\n\nPope Francis' coffin was carried in an open-air popemobile, a white Mercedes-Benz bearing Vatican flags, through the streets of Rome in a motorcade.\n\nThe coffin was transported about 2.5 miles to the Basilica of St. Mary Major, where Francis was buried in a private service.\n\nAs the popemobile made its way to the basilica, thousands of onlookers waved and clapped along the streets.\n\nWhere is Pope Francis being buried?\n\nPope Francis' funeral service lasted two hours, compared to John Paul's service in 2005 that last lasted three hours.\n\nIn his final testament, Francis asked to be buried inside the burial niche between Chapel of the Salus Populi Romani and Sforza Chapel, which are located within the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome instead of in the Grotto at St. Peter's Basilica. He is the first pope being laid to rest outside the Vatican in almost a century.\n\nThe pope, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, also requested a \"simple\" burial: \"The tomb should be in the ground; simple, without particular ornamentation, and bearing only the inscription: Franciscus,\" he instructed.\n\nSt. Mary Major was special to Francis because of his devotion to Mary, Mother of God. He prayed there before and after many overseas trips.\n\nSt. Mary Major Basilica not the usual resting place for a pope\n\nThe final resting place for Pope Francis is a nearly 1,600-year-old church and shrine to the Virgin Mary. The first pope to be buried outside the Vatican in more than a century, Pope Francis will be the eighth pope buried at St. Mary Major, Reuters reported.\n\nPopes typically are buried in grottoes beneath St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nSt. Mary Major is one of the four “Papal Basilicas,\" according to Vatican News. Pope Sixtus III ordered St. Mary Major Basilica be rebuilt and enlarged in the year 432, according to the basilica's website. St. Mary Major is the home of the relic of the Holy Crib, the manger of Baby Jesus, as well as the remains of St. Matthew and St. Jerome.\n\nSt. Mary Major also houses the tombs of artist Gian Bernini and his father Pietro, who had a workshop behind the Pauline Chapel at the basilica. Gian Bernini designed the colonnade in St. Peter's Square in front of the basilica and the massive baldacchino, or canopy, inside the basilica, which is meant to mark the tomb of St. Peter. Pietro Bernini, who is credited along with his son for creating the Fontana della Barcaccia (\"Fountain of the Leaky Boat\") at the foot of the Spanish Steps.\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy meet at pope's funeral\n\nPresident Donald Trump had a brief \"private\" meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of the funeral, White House communications director Steve Cheung said.\n\nCheung said the two leaders had a \"very productive\" conversation and that further details of the meeting would be made public in the coming hours. Ukraine said they would meet again later in the day. The White House has not confirmed that.\n\nIt was the first meeting since Trump and Zelenskyy had a fiery clash in the Oval Office in February about how to reach a peace settlement with Russia over their war.\n\nTrump gets front-row seat at pope's funeral\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump were seated in the front row for the service despite precedent established at the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II calling for him to be in the third row behind monarchs, the Daily Beast reported.\n\nAt that event, the news site reported, Catholic royals were placed in the front row, followed by non-Catholic royals. Non-royal heads of state were placed behind them according to their countries' alphabetical order.\n\nTrump's midnight blue suit stood in contrast to the waves of black.\n\nTrump and Pope Francis had clashed over the president's plans to deport millions of migrants from the U.S., calling Trump's crackdown a \"disgrace,\" as well as his cuts to foreign aid and programs supporting domestic welfare.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhy is the pope's casket lined with zinc?\n\nPope Francis' coffin also breaks with papal tradition. Instead of being buried in three coffins − each made of cypress, lead and elm and placed inside the other − he was buried in one simple one that is wooden and lined with zinc.\n\nThe coffin is shaped like a tapered hexagonal box. It it wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, resembling a human body.\n\nAccording to global repatriation firm Homeland International, zinc is used to make coffins airtight and hermetically sealed. Steve Soult Limited, a coffin supplier in Nottingham, England, said zinc liners offer an additional safeguard to counter “external factors such as water, insects and other natural elements.”\n\n“By safeguarding the coffin, these liners ensure that the memory of our loved one remains undisturbed, allowing us to find solace in knowing their resting place will endure the test of time,” the company said in a TikTok post. Zinc, it said, is “a durable and corrosion-resistant metal” that “helps to preserve the integrity of the coffin over time.”\n\n− George Petras, Janet Loehrke and Marc Ramirez\n\n'Football-loving' Pope Francis had soccer card of 'destiny'\n\nPope Francis remained a soccer fan during his time at the Vatican and some in his home country of Argentina think the pope made a set piece out of his passing.\n\nA fan of the San Lorenzo de Almagro football club in his hometown Buenos Aires, Pope Francis literally remained a card-carrying supporter of the club. The number on his card: 88235.\n\nThe numbers coincide with the age of Pope Francis at his death (88) and his time of death, which the Vatican said was 7:35 a.m. (2:35 a.m. local time in Buenos Aires). San Lorenzo de Almagro confirmed the pope's membership number to Reuters. The card bears the name of Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the pope's name at birth in 1936.\n\n\"It has to be destiny,” Ramiro Rodríguez, who wore a San Lorenzo team shirt (along with a rosary) to an April 25 mass to celebrate the pope's life, told CNN.\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nWhat is the Book of the Gospels?\n\nThe Book of the Gospels was resting on top of Pope Francis' coffin as funeral prayers were read.\n\nThe book is “a sign of Christ’s presence in the liturgy,” according to the Midwest Theological Forum. “It is revered with the same holy kiss given to the altar.”\n\nIt contains readings from the Gospels according to Mark, Matthew, Luke and John and is sometimes presented for use accompanied by a procession of servers bearing incense and candles, according to an essay published in Pastoral Liturgy by Kristopher Seaman, associate director of the office of worship for the Diocese of Gary in northwest Indiana.\n\nThe book is typically placed on the Catholic pulpit, and opened to the page of the day’s particular reading.\n\nThe book also plays a role in the conclave in which the College of Cardinals will meet to choose Francis’ successor. Before the selection process begins, each cardinal places a hand on the book while pledging to follow the conclave’s rules and vows of secrecy.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nJohn Kerry says pope was frustrated over climate change inaction\n\nPope Francis privately expressed frustration over human inaction on dealing with climate change, former Secretary of State John Kerry told MSNBC ahead of the pontiff's funeral.\n\nKerry, who served as U.S. climate envoy during the Biden administration, told MSNBC that Francis “absolutely” showed frustration in the four meetings they had to discuss climate change.\n\n\"He would roll his eyes a little bit about the human challenge, getting people to do things, but he had faith in that,\" Kerry said. \"Obviously, he had faith. He was remarkable in his steady, calm, quiet but totally dedicated mission of dealing with this.\"\n\nPope Francis used his papacy to repeatedly call for reduced carbon emissions in industrialized countries, including in a 2015 address to Congress. In 2023, he criticized the United States as particularly \"irresponsible\" on emissions compared to China.\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nWho was the oldest pope?\n\nAt 88 years, 4 months and 4 days old, Francis was one of the oldest popes in the church’s history. Of all 266 pontificates, he died at a younger age than only a handful of others, though records for many are scant.\n\nThe oldest verified death of a pope was Leo XIII, who was 93 when he died in 1903. St. Agatho, a 7th-century pope, is said to have been well over 100 years old when he died during a plague in Rome, but the historical record on his age is limited.\n\nFrancis became the 266th pope in 2013 when he was 76, also making him one of the oldest popes elected. Francis’ predecessor, Benedict XVI, was already 78 by the time he was elected. Benedict resigned at 85 years old and died in 2022 at the age of 95.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nA son to Italian immigrants: Who is Pope Francis' family?\n\nBorn on Dec. 17, 1936, Francis was one of five children born to Italian immigrant parents. His father, Mario, was an accountant and his mother, Regina, was a “committed wife,” according to the Vatican biography.\n\nFrancis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was the eldest, according to the New York Times. When he was elected pope in 2013, he had one living sibling, a sister named María Elena Bergoglio, who was 64 at the time, according to the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nMaría, who is 12 years younger than Jorge, told the Reporter at the time that she hoped her brother wouldn't become pope because she \"wanted him to come back!\"\n\nIn another interview with CNN en Español, she said that when Francis called her after being elected, he told Maria to tell the rest of their family.\n\n“He said, ‘I cannot call everyone. We are a very big family, so please send them my love. Because if I call everyone, it will empty the Vatican coffers,’” Maria said.\n\n−Saman Shafiq\n\nFrancis was first Jesuit pope. What is a Jesuit?\n\nPope Francis was the first Jesuit to lead the church in its nearly 2,000-year history.\n\nThe Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuits, is a Roman Catholic order founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius of Loyola. Jesuits adhere to Ignatian spirituality as laid out a document called the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, which sets guidelines for meditation, self-awareness and prayer.\n\nJesuits strive to be “contemplatives in action,” turning their spirituality into action, and are known for their efforts to promote global justice, peace and dialogue.\n\nJesuit institutions in the United States include Georgetown University, Gonzaga University, Boston College, St. Louis University, Fordham University and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat type of security is in place for the pope's funeral?\n\nThe security operation in and around Vatican City is in full swing.\n\nThe funeral has brought together dozens of world leaders and thousands of people from around the world who traveled to Rome to pay their respects.\n\nAbout 2,000 local police officers are on duty at Pope' Francis' funeral. They are joined by thousands more officers from the national security forces. Security measures include patrols on the Tiber, drones and snipers.\n\nStreets were closed to traffic around the Vatican on Saturday. Authorities also announced a no-fly zone over Rome for the week.\n\nPope's call to 'build bridges, not walls' highlighted\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke in his homily of the pope's constant call to \"build bridges, not walls\" between people. The pope held a Mass on the U.S.-Mexico border to highlight what he described as the \"human tragedy\" of \"forced migration\" when he visited the area in 2016.\n\nThe cardinal also recalled that Franics' first ever foreign trip as pope was when he went to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a key spot in Europe's refugees and migrants crisis.\n\nFrancis met with refugees and migrants in Lampedusa.\n\nUS journalist participates in pope's funeral. Who is Kielce Gussie?\n\nKielce Gussie, the woman who delivered the first reading during the funeral service, is a journalist with Vatican News. Francis created the outlet to improve news coming from the Vatican.\n\nGussie joined Vatican News in October 2024 after more than two years at Rome Reports TV News Agency, a news agency focused on covering the pope and the Vatican, according to her LinkedIn page.\n\nGussie, whose Scripture reading came from the Acts of the Apostles, found out she was going to be part of the funeral on April 23, wrote Inside Edition's Deborah Norville on social media. Gussie, who grew up in Florida, told Norville, \"her dream was always to work as a reporter for the Vatican.\"\n\n− Mike Snider\n\nWho was the longest-serving pope?\n\nPope Francis served as head of the Catholic Church for 12 years, 1 month and 8 days, according to the deed buried with him. Francis’ reign was longer than the 7.5-year average time of the prior 265 pontificates, Reuters reported.\n\nBut the longest serving pope was much longer in verified and unverified history.\n\nThe longest confirmed pontificate was Pius IX, the 255th pope, who served for 32 years from 1846 until his death in 1878. He was 85 years old.\n\nSt. Peter, one of Jesus Christ's 12 apostles who is considered the first pope, is said to have served 31 to 38 years. Peter headed the early church until his death sometime between 64 and 67 AD in Rome.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nTrump, Biden, Zelenskyy, not Putin at funeral\n\nDozens of world leaders and heads of state are now in Rome. Some of them have clashed with both the pope and each other.\n\nPope Francis once said that President Donald Trump's plans to impose mass deportations of immigrants were a “disgrace.” Before taking their seats, Trump and his wife Melania paid their respects to Francis’ coffin in St. Peter’s Basilica. The coffin was sealed shut on Friday night.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not had any easy time navigating Trump's attempts to secure a peace deal for the Ukraine-Russia war. The two leaders clashed in an Oval Office meeting in late February. The two leaders briefly met before the service. Former President Joe Biden and wife Jill are also in Rome.\n\nOne notable absence is Russia's Vladimir Putin, who portrays himself as a main of serious faith. Putin is subject to an international criminal court arrest warrant over his invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin said he wouldn't be attending.\n\nWho is presiding over today's funeral service for Pope Francis?\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91, dean of the College of Cardinals, will preside over the funeral Mass, which will be celebrated by patriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests from around the world, the Vatican said.\n\nThe College of Cardinals decides who will be the next pope in a highly secretive ritual called a papal conclave. As dean, Re is one of the most senior figures in the church. He has spent five decades serving in the Roman curia, the church's various administrative institutions.\n\nIn a biography on the College of Cardinals website, Re is described as having an \"affable manner and efficient approach to issues and conflicts.\"\n\nPope’s tomb made of ‘people’s stone’\n\nPope Francis' simple tomb, inscribed with just \"Franciscus\" and a reproduction of his pectoral cross, is made of marble from Italy’s Liguria region, where Francis traces his family's origins before they settled in his native Argentina, according to Vatican News.\n\nFrancis requested to be buried in a tomb made from Ligurian stone. The plaque of slate, described as a “fine-grained gray, green or bluish metamorphic rock,” commemorates Francis’ great-grandfather, Vincenzo Sivori, on his mother’s side, the news website said.\n\nFranca Garbaino, president of the Slate District in Liguria, said it was “not a noble stone,” but instead it was “the people’s stone” that “gives warmth.”\n\nFrancis’ family traces back to Cogorno, located southeast of Genoa, the capital of Liguria.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhy do Swiss Guards guard the Vatican?\n\nThe Swiss Guard has been protecting popes since the 1500s. Members have a ceremonial role but also a protective one and, to an extent, they are mercenaries. They wear distinctive uniforms with feathered helmets, ruffled collars and puffed-out sleeves.\n\nThey are sometimes referred to as the world's smallest army and are trained to an elite level in counterintelligence, close-quarters combat and bomb disposal. They are independent of Switzerland's army, though they are trained in Switzerland.\n\nCompetition to be a Swiss Guard is intense. There are only 135 of them.\n\nWhat will the weather be like for the funeral today?\n\nThe weather has been spectacular all week in Vatican City, and conditions for the funeral also look terrific, forecasters said.\n\n\"It should a nice and calm day,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jacob Hinson told USA TODAY. He said sunny to partly cloudy skies are expected, with highs in the 70s.\n\nWind should not be an issue either, he added, with gusts of only 6-10 mph in the forecast.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nThousands lined up to pay homage at St. Peter's Basilica\n\nAbout 250,000 people bid farewell to Francis through this week as the pope was lying in state at St. Peter's. Lines stretched more than half a mile north of the Vatican, and some people reported waits of about three hours to get inside the basilica.\n\n“He was a wonderful pope,” Alessandra Caccamo of Rome said as she waited outside the Vatican. “I’m going to miss him so much, because it’s like I’ve lost a piece of me.”\n\nRachel Mckay, from Britain, said Francis was \"somebody who made the church very accessible to everybody and inclusive to everybody. He's like a member of the family, somebody very close to our hearts.\"\n\nPope is a global icon: Fascination with papacy's rituals take center stage\n\nWhen will a new pope be picked?\n\nA conclave to choose a new pope normally takes place 15 to 20 days after the death of a pontiff, meaning it should not start before May 6. As of this week, there were 252 cardinals, of whom 135 are electors, according to the Vatican. Cardinals over the age of 80 are excluded from voting.\n\nIn medieval times, cardinals could take years to elect a new pope. Conclaves are much shorter now. Pope Francis was elected the day after the conclave began in 2013.\n\nVoting takes place in a series of rounds until a clear winner emerges.\n\nThe world is waiting with bated breadth to find out who the next pontiff will be. Several names have emerged as possible front-runners, including bishops from Canada and the Philippines. Pope Francis was the first non-European pope elected in 1,300 years.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/opinions/beijing-olympics-closing-ceremony-bass", "title": "Opinion: Beijing Olympics hit the heights – and the depths | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Amy Bass (@bassab1) is professor of sport studies at Manhattanville College and the author of “One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game That Brought a Divided Town Together” and “Not the Triumph but the Struggle: The 1968 Olympics and the Making of the Black Athlete,” among other titles.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAmy Bass Courtesy Rodney Bedsole\n\nA giant Chinese knot symbolizing fortune and unity welcomed the athletes who paraded into Beijing’s Bird’s Nest for the Closing Ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.\n\nFor an athlete who hasn’t won a medal, such as Jamaican bobsledder Rolando Reid, whose team ranked 28th, carrying the flag provides a special moment, but it is one enjoyed by medalists, too, such as Canadian speed skater Isabelle Weidemann, who leaves Beijing with one in every color.\n\nThe ups and downs of the Olympics might best be understood through the eyes of bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor, who carried the American flag, wearing a navy face mask which could barely contain her grin. She was, of course, selected to be the flag bearer in the Opening Ceremony, but a positive COVID-19 test kept her confined to a hotel, watching the festivities on television.\n\nWhile Meyers Taylor was left to lift weights in her room, her competitors got in early training runs. Her Olympics, however, turned out just fine, clearing Covid protocols in time for her to take silver in the inaugural run of the women’s monobob and bronze in the two-woman bobsled. With five career medals, she now stands as the most decorated female bobsledder, the oldest American woman to win a medal in the winter, and the most decorated Black athlete in Olympic Winter Games history.\n\nCovid sidelined some athletes, to be sure, including American skater Vincent Zhou, who announced his withdrawal from the men’s individual event in a gut-wrenching Instagram post. But Beijing’s “closed loop” – in which athletes, officials, and media lived behind impenetrable barricades and endured daily swabs and temperature checks – ensured that by Closing Ceremony, the infection rate of The Games hovered around 0.01. Beijing was, according to IOC President Thomas Bach, “one of the safest places on this planet,” with just one positive test of the almost 70,000 administered on the final weekend.\n\nBut as Russian troops continue to aggressively move on the border of Ukraine, the war against Covid-19 is just one the world faces. The ancient Olympics served as a means to interrupt the conflicts of warring Greek states, guided by the spirit of ekecheiria, or truce so spectators and athletes could travel to and from The Games in peace.\n\nIn Beijing, however, a hug between Ukraine’s Oleksandr Abramenko, who marked his fifth Olympic appearance, and Russia’s Ilia Burov, silver and bronze medalists in men’s aerials respectively, defied Ukrainian officials who warned athletes against social contact with members of the Russian team, especially when photographers were around.\n\nJust as a few weeks of sport did little to convince the ancient Greeks to lay down their weapons, Ukrainian athletes may wonder what they will return home to see. Sledder Vladyslav Heraskevych finished a run by holding a sign which read “NO WAR IN UKRAINE,” an ostensibly political act the IOC turned a blind eye to, but it has been impossible to ignore Russia at any moment of these Games.\n\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin’s aggressions toward Ukraine are not much different from the country’s medal haul in Beijing, despite the fact the country is still serving out an Olympic ban because of systemic state-sponsored doping. Russian athletes, without their flag or anthem, have been allowed to compete throughout the “ban,” providing they pass drug tests. Putin not only attended the Opening Ceremony, he stood and cheered as the Russian athletes entered the stadium under the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nDuring the Closing Ceremony, the continuously puzzling presence of the Russians got in one last word, with Alexander Bolshunov and Ivan Yakimushkin receiving their respective gold and silver medals in the men’s 50-kilometer cross-country race (shortened to 30 kilometers because of poor conditions), Tchaikovsky’s “Piano Concerto No. 1” replacing the banned Russian national anthem as is done whenever ROC received a medal.\n\nAbsent from the Closing Ceremony was 15-year-old Kamila Valieva, whose team, led by controversial coach Eteri Tutberidze, posted a video to their Instagram story of the young skater back on the practice ice in Russia, appearing as though it was time for business as usual, rather than reflection on what went down in Beijing.\n\nThe saga of the young skater, who competed despite a positive drug test, overshadowed much of the skating competition. While the IOC insisted on “quiet diplomacy” while the world demanded the safety of missing tennis star Peng Shuai, who largely disappeared from public life in November, the organization’s president, Thomas Bach, made uncharacteristic comments regarding Valieva’s implosion during the women’s free skate, and the “chilling” – his word – reception she endured from Tutberidze when she came off the ice. Tutberidze said she was “at a loss” over his comments.\n\nThe image of Valieva standing alone on the ice moments before her music began and the ensuing tumbles would take place, a look of terror in her eyes, a bottom lip that appeared chewed with worry, forced to deal with the consequences of the choices those around her likely made, remains one of the starkest of these Games.\n\nHer story bled into the entirety of the women’s competition, perhaps especially seen in the competition’s aftermath: Gold medalist Anna Shcherbakova stood alone, seemingly shocked by the outcome and with no vibe of victory visible, as her entire team focused on the fallen Valieva and an angry Alexandra Trusova, who likely figured her five quads would ensure her the top spot.\n\nDespite a timid hug offered by Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto – thrilled to have broken into the predicted Russian sweep with her bronze medal – Shcherbakova’s face, her solitude, in what should have been a moment of joy at a life’s dream finally being accomplished, reminded us again these are not normal times, and this is an Olympics taking place on a grim landscape, in a moment of global exhaustion.\n\nThe question remains, then, as to what comes next. It is not just the well-known Russian skating machine that failed its athletes, or even the Olympic movement that continues to allow Russia as much leeway as it needs to land 32 medals despite serving out its ban.\n\nIt is all of us, anyone who watched Sherbakova stand there, alone: We are letting this happen, right in front of us, out in the open, just as we are watching Russian troops assemble on Ukraine’s borders. Sport has, again, provided us with clarity as to what is happening in the world, with the avaricious corruption of young female skaters front and center.\n\nIn four years, the world, or at least those with prowess on ice and snow, will assemble in Italy, with Cortina d’Ampezzo and Milan serving as host.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe will watch in hopes of having the moments that make us happier than we thought we could be: snowboarder Chloe Kim smiling after laying down her gold medal run, pairs skaters Han Cong and Sui Wenjing finding redemption on home ice by just 0.63 of a point, cross-country skier Jessie Diggins collapsing after crossing the finish line for silver in the 30 km, just hours after suffering from food poisoning, and the continued rivalry in hockey between the US and Canada. At the same time, we will understand that moments such as a lost and alone Sherbakova or a confessional Mikaela Shiffrin, who walks away with nothing to add to her pile of victories but remains one of the greatest in her sport, might shatter our hearts.\n\nThat is the shambolic wonder of the Olympic Games, reinforcing our good, while ensuring the bad is never out of sight.", "authors": ["Amy Bass"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/joe-biden-first-year-in-office", "title": "Joe Biden enters the second year of his presidency looking for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs he walked through the front gate of the White House complex last year for the first time as President, Joe Biden declared it felt like “going home.”\n\nIf the presidency seemed then like a natural fit for a 50-year creature of Washington, today its limits are leading to a reckoning over expectations and ambitions in a country as exhausted, angry and divided as ever.\n\nBiden enters the second year of his term with one of the lowest approval ratings of a modern-day president, depleted of the political capital and sense of confidence that followed him into office.\n\nA sense of normalcy returned to the White House following the whiplash of Donald Trump’s presidency, but a string of setbacks – at home and abroad – have eroded the air of competence that once surrounded a President and his team, who have spent most of their lives in government and campaigned for the job on a pledge of restoring order.\n\nOn most days since January 20, 2021, the President has arrived at the Oval Office early in the morning, peppered his team with detailed questions and tried not to think too much about the man who’d just vacated the building, leaving behind a pandemic, angry divisions and – inside a drawer of the Resolute Desk – a lengthy letter for Biden. The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family’s furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nThe 12 months Biden has been in office did come with major victories. He successfully guided passage of trillions in new funding to combat the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild American’s crumbling infrastructure through Congress. He has appointed more federal judges than his recent predecessors, overseen a boom in hiring, a drop in poverty and orchestrated a nationwide vaccination campaign.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A “malaise” has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve – while his own son watched on.\n\n“There are successes that he’s had, but people do not feel it and you can’t persuade people to feel better. You can’t jawbone that,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama’s White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to “end this uncivil war” remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden’s trademark personal style – wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office – hasn’t brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nRELATED: Battered White House searches for a Biden comeback scenario\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring “independence from the virus” on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid’s permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n“Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden’s election,” said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. “He was not elected to transform the country.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\n“They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,” one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden’s first year is ending with a focus on what he didn’t accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n“Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.”\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n“There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They’re in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We’re not doing good enough,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n“The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They’re worthless,” Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as “an incredibly difficult circumstance.”\n\n“You don’t get everything done in the first year,” Psaki said. “The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.”\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden – the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n“This virus has fooled us multiple times,” one senior health official told CNN. “Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it’s a big, big surprise.”\n\nRELATED: Biden vowed to fix testing. But he didn’t plan for Omicron.\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, “you should keep your head down and keep working.”\n\n“He’s not panicking. He’s not blaming anyone,” the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President’s approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBiden’s poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he’d once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker’s day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n“You know what it takes to go meet with the President?” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. “It’s just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You’ve got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.”\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year’s midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset – on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden – whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week – is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden’s speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation’s oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,” she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024. And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris – whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues – have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won’t.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden’s sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It’s a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn’t understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden’s achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n“I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,” said Susan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. “We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.”\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden’s first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected – despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off – even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would “pop up a little bit and then go back down,” he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend – one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he’d thought of ordering millions more tests earlier – even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden’s promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his “wit’s end.”\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn’t executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most – chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti – have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n“If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I’d have a new chief of staff,” one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn’t accustomed to – and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend’s house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander, arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called “The Bulletin.” He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President’s preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden’s quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere’s little question that the outcome of his second year – and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have – will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/what-happens-after-queen-dies-intl", "title": "What happens after the Queen dies: The funeral and other ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nWith the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, every detail of the next fortnight has been planned and rehearsed to the finest detail – and was even signed off by the monarch herself.\n\nThere have been regular meetings for decades between the many agencies involved, from central and local government departments to military and religious authorities and representatives of the other 14 countries where she was also head of state.\n\nThe Union Flag will be lowered on public buildings across the United Kingdom.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nGun salutes and title changes\n\nOne of the first formalities to take place will be a meeting of the Accession Council in an ancient ceremony at the 500-year-old St James’s Palace in London. It comes in two parts. In the first part, the sovereign’s death is formally announced, and the new sovereign is proclaimed. This is a closed meeting but attended by hundreds of dignitaries and members of the Privy Council, which is a panel of royal advisors.\n\nThe Garter King of Arms will read the Proclamation from the palace balcony and gun salutes will echo across the capital. There will be follow-up proclamations at the Royal Exchange in the financial district and in the capitals of the nations – Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Flags will return to full staff whilst the proclamations are made.\n\nThe second part of the Accession Council is attended by the King and other senior royals. For the first time in history, we will get to see this centuries-old ritual because it will be broadcast live.\n\nPrince William is now first in line to the throne and has inherited the title of Duke of Cornwall from his father and the income that comes from it. He’s now independently wealthy and his wife, Kate, has taken the title of Duchess of Cornwall, replacing Camilla who technically becomes Queen. The world will then watch as King Charles III takes a series of oaths and swears allegiance to the Church of Scotland.\n\nBooks of condolence will then open at St James’s Palace and at other venues. Following the Accession Council, he will return to Buckingham Palace for meetings with senior politicians and church leaders before retiring.\n\nIn the 24 hours after the Queen’s death is announced, there will be gun salutes across London – one round for every year of Elizabeth’s life – and a broadcast by the new King will be played out. A service will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral in the coming days, which won’t be attended by the royal family. It’s a moment for the public to remember their Queen. Expect local services to pop up across the country. The Queen was Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nOver the coming days, the bells of Westminster Abbey, St Pauls and Windsor Castle will toll.\n\nFuneral arrangements\n\nAs monarch, Queen Elizabeth is automatically granted a publicly funded state funeral, and details will be released in the coming days. The Queen died at Balmoral Castle, her residence in Scotland, so over the coming days arrangements will be made for her to be transported back to England.\n\nElizabeth may have approved her own funeral plans, but they can only be signed off by the sitting monarch. King Charles III will perform that duty in a meeting with the Earl Marshal who overseas ceremonial events. We can assume he will give his go-ahead as he has already seen the plans and may have made adjustments as part of the planning process.\n\nThe last order of business on the day of death was expected to be a meeting of the Lord Chamberlain’s Committee, which is responsible for the running of the Royal Household, to make sure everything is in place for the next two weeks, including the state funeral in Westminster and interment in Windsor.\n\nPast monarchs have lain in state in Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the UK parliament. Their coffin resting on a raised platform in the middle of the hall and guarded around the clock by units from the Sovereign’s Bodyguard, Foot Guards or the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nBritish royal family members who hold high military rank, the consort of the sovereign, and the heir to the throne are normally granted ceremonial royal funerals instead.\n\nPrince Philip, the Queen’s husband of more than 70 years and the longest-serving British consort in history, was given a royal ceremonial funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, west of London, in April 2021. Coronavirus pandemic restrictions meant the congregation was limited to 30 close family members and friends.\n\nPhilip was also intimately involved in planning his own funeral service, making sure the ceremony reflected his military affiliations and personal interests. Millions of people watched the televised funeral procession and service from home but crowds were discouraged from gathering at Windsor or other royal residences.\n\nAll other members of the royal family, their children and their spouses are usually granted a private royal ceremony.", "authors": ["Max Foster Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/king-charles-iii-england-profile-intl", "title": "What can the world expect from King Charles III? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, Charles has ascended to the British throne after more than 70 years as the heir apparent.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the official announcement of her passing, Charles described the death of his “beloved” mother as “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.” The days since the Queen’s death have been a time during which Charles has both assumed his new duties and mourned a great personal loss.\n\nAfter a lifetime in the public eye, he is a familiar figure to many in Britain and around the globe. But no one yet knows what kind of monarch King Charles III – the title he has taken, ending years of speculation – will become.\n\nAs CNN’s royal correspondent, I’ve reported on Britain’s new King for many years and traveled around the world with him.\n\nOne of the best insights I had was when I was invited with a group of other journalists to Dumfries House, his stately home near Glasgow in Scotland, in 2018 ahead of his 70th birthday. I spent two days there and was given unusual access to Charles and many of those closest to him. I was treated to tours of the estate, high tea, dinners and a spectacular bagpiping performance beside a roaring open fire.\n\nThis is the place that brings it all together for the new King, all his greatest passions and causes – from music to rare breeds protection, apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth and organic farming. The whole estate is buzzing with activity, and I could see what a thrill it gave him to walk around and ask questions of his staff.\n\nEvery Friday night, wherever he is in the world, Charles is sent a hefty report updating him on the estate’s work and he has it back to them first thing Saturday morning with notes. His wife Camilla will tell you he’s up late every night reading, writing and responding to requests for support and advice.\n\nWhere many of his predecessors saw his former role of Prince of Wales as a ticket to a playboy lifestyle and a guaranteed income, Charles professionalized it and made it his own. He wanted a legacy, but he didn’t want to wait until he was King. In my experience, he’s impatient and driven, and gets incredibly frustrated if one of his projects isn’t working or bearing fruit.\n\n“The signs were there from young adulthood,” Kenneth Dunsmuir told me during the visit to Dumfries House. Dunsmuir runs The Prince’s Foundation, an educational charity set up by Charles to help teach traditional arts and skills. “His concerns about social issues in the community and ecological issues were all there and all that’s happened is that he has got more and more involved and has had the time to do that.”\n\nDumfries House is Charles' stately home near Glasgow in Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDunsmuir’s comment points to the other reason Charles achieved so much during his tenure: he was the longest-serving Prince of Wales ever due to the longevity of his mother’s reign. Dunsmuir thinks of Dumfries House, he said, as a “fantastic physical legacy to that work that will always be here and always remain.”\n\nCharles has often struggled to contain his passion for his work, expressing his hopes and fears during speeches over the years and often sounding more like a campaigner than a constitutional monarch-in-waiting. That prompted accusations that he was threatening the independence and impartiality of the monarchy. Take climate change, on which he has been speaking out since 1968. It’s since become a mainstream issue and, for some, a political one. Charles was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump over tea in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.”\n\nI sat down with Charles for an interview that day and he insisted the Paris Accord was still achievable. “We can’t go on like this, with every month another record in temperatures being broken. If we leave it too long, and we have done, just growing things is going to become difficult,” he said.\n\nDespite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years.\n\nCharles was in his element at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November 2021, where he implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn't work-shy. Victoria Jones/Pool/Getty Images\n\n“We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he said at the time. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added.\n\nUS President Joe Biden commented on Charles’ decades-long efforts at the event, paying him the ultimate compliment by saying he’d got “the whole thing going” and “that’s how it all started.”\n\nCharles has been outspoken on a whole range of sensitive issues from genetically modified crops to homeopathic medicines and architecture. It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion. Elizabeth’s legendary ability not to offend and alienate was more strategic than many realize, but Charles has always insisted he intends to follow her lead and stop meddling when he takes the throne.\n\nCharles, pictured with Camilla, professionalized the role of Prince of Wales and made it his own. Hugo Burnand/Getty Images\n\nCharles walks in Cambridge in 1967 when he began his term at Trinity College. Peter Dunne/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Charles said to the BBC: “The idea, somehow, that I’m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two – the two situations – are completely different.” When specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”\n\nIn all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes.\n\nCharles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife.\n\nI’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera.\n\nCharles and William, pictured with Prince Harry in 1997, came together personally and professionally when Harry stepped back from his royal duties in 2020. Tim Graham Photo Library/Getty Images\n\nIn 2015 I sat down with Charles at another of his residences in Scotland – Birkhall, in the Highlands. It was to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary ahead of a US tour.\n\nHe told me, “It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps.”\n\nAfter the interview, I went with him to a drawing room where we were joined by Camilla as we waited for the cameras to get ready for some set-up shots. Camilla was asking how it went and joking about our outfits, and he was immediately more relaxed in her company. Her ability to steady a room has now become a national asset, as the wife of the country’s head of state – and symbol of stability.\n\nWith Camilla standing firmly by his side, Charles will now set his stamp on the monarchy. After decades in waiting, he is not only head of state for the United Kingdom but also for 14 other nations including Canada and Australia. The eyes of the world are on him as he assumes the mantle of King.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/royal-family-king-charles-iii-intl-gbr", "title": "Royal family: As King Charles III takes the throne, big changes lie ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGod save the Queen, long live the King.

As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2025/02/14/philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-parade-2025-live-coverage-philly-delaware/78516769007/", "title": "Eagles parade 2025: Our coverage of Super Bowl parade in ...", "text": "Hello, Delaware, Philadelphia and the surrounding area!\n\nIt's perhaps the second most exciting day of the Eagles postseason — though hopefully a little less nerve-wracking than Sunday.

Brown kept his speech short but made sure to let loose an expletive while ensuring everyone knew the Eagles were Super Bowl champs.\n\nKnown for singing, left tackle Jordan Mailata left out the curses but led the crowd in a rendition of \"We Are The Champions.\"\n\nEagles Defensive End Brandon Graham, who is contemplating retirement, finished off the speeches thanking players and coaches before starting to sing \"We're from Philly\" with fans.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nSpeeches begin with head coach, owner, GM\n\nUp first for the Eagles was owner Jeffrey Lurie, who called the connection between the city and team a love affair — fitting since the celebration came on Valentine's Day.\n\nNick Sirianni kept his comments short, thanking the players and fans before giving an E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles chant.\n\nSporting a gash on his forehead after being hit with a beer can along the parade route, General Manager Howie Roseman walked to the podium with cheers and chants of \"Howie, Howie.\"\n\n\"I bleed for this city! Go Eagles!,\" Roseman said. \"We're two-time champs and we're coming back strong. Go Birds!\"\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nPlayers descend to the podium\n\nAfter players took a short break from the parade to refresh, Eagles announcer Merrill Reese introduced the team. Players walked to the podium with DMX blaring across the parkway.\n\nA Philadelphia Police Department Honor Guard then marched out to present the colors and a saxophonist played the National Anthem.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro took the stage moments later, telling the crowd he's a \"die-hard Eagles fan.\"\n\n\"The Eagles are America's team,\" Shapiro said.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker then took the stage, telling fans: \"We did it!\"\n\n— Anthony Dimattia and Isabel Hughes\n\nSpeeches underway with Eagles fight song\n\n\"Fly Eagles Fly, on the road to victory.\n\nE-A-G-L-E-S! Eagles!\"\n\nSpeeches kicked off shortly after 2 p.m. And of course, fans were asked to chant the Eagles fight song.\n\n— Isabel Hughes\n\nEagles swooping in\n\nThe parade finally approached the art museum.\n\nFans rushed alongside the buses to get a close up view of the procession.\n\nPlayers and coaches danced with fans, who decorated trees and light posts along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\n\"I knew that we were going to win after the NFC Championship game,\" said 37-year-old Chelsea, from Arizona. \"Immediately after each of those NFC Championships, I booked my flight and hotel.\"\n\nChelsea was five months pregnant during the 2018 celebration and now is enjoying her time in Philadelphia with her friends while her husband stayed home in Arizona with their children.\n\n\"Everybody thought I was crazy, but I said 'We’re doing it,'\" she said.\n\n— Molly McVety and Shane Brennan\n\nMemories being made\n\nChris Lowney, from South Philadelphia, and Aleala Emanowicz, from Vorhees, New Jersey were joined by a group of friends on the east side of Broad and Locust streets.\n\nLowney arrived at 5:45 a.m. After previously learning their lessons of what not do to, they came prepared this year.\n\n“I got here earlier this year to make sure,” Lowney said. “We brought beers, we brought chairs.”\n\nWhen asked what this year’s win meant to them, Lowney expressed that this Super Bowl solidified the city’s talent, calling it a “belt to the (expletive)”.\n\n“This was everything we wanted this season,” Emanowicz said. “That’s what Kansas City deserves.”\n\nSomerdale, New Jersey resident Ernest, who only gave his first name, geared up for the parade with his cousin Kim, from North Philadelphia.\n\nThe two grew up as Eagles fans and reminisced on a time when their parents were season ticket holders. That dated as far back to when the team played at Franklin Field.\n\n“This win means everything,” Ernest said. “We’re dominant. 2018 was emotional. This time we’re a little bit more arrogant, and we want to run it back. It’s love.”\n\n“It was an amazing win,” Kim said. “Our parents were Eagles fans since the 1960s. This means a lot. It makes me emotional!”\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nEagles to speak at 2 p.m.\n\nThe celebrations continued as the Eagles victory parade pushed closer to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where the world champions are expected to give their speeches.\n\nWell-wishers gathered along the stairs made famous by the Rocky movie.\n\nThere was also plenty of celebration going on along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway — including some cowboys?\n\n— Martin Frank and Kelly Powers\n\nMs. Rogers of Brandywine Hundred\n\nSakeenah Salam, a graduate of West Philly High who now lives in Wilmington, Delaware, sells Eagles bracelets steps on Chestnut near the parade route.\n\n\"It is great just so many people trying to get in to celebrate the Eagles, said Salam, who is in her 70s.\n\nShe sold bracelets for recent games including Super Bowl Sunday. She noted she \"must be doing something right.\"\n\nSalam, a retired mail carrier, referred to herself as the Ms. Rogers of the Silverside and Marsh Road routes in Brandywine Hundred.\n\n\"I just love talking to people,\" she said. \"I want to do everything I can while I can.\"\n\nToday, she mainly wants to tell the city: \"Go Eagles.\"\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nParade progresses\n\nThe parade has made its way to Center City Philadelphia.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nHurts so good\n\n\"It's an honor to truly lead this city,\" said Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts while wearing a \"Love, Hurts\" sweatshirt. When asked about his observation of the crowd that showed up for the parade Friday: \"Never had any expectations but we know how Eagles fans show up.\"\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nParty on the parade route\n\nWho's having a good time? Eagles tight end Grant Calcaterra, that's for sure.\n\nWearing a kelly green jacket, Calcaterra downed two Miller Lites before smashing the cans together then throwing them from the bus toward the crowd.\n\nA little before noon, Eagles left guard Landon Dickerson dropped a \"Go (expletive) Birds\" on live TV.\n\nShortly after, Reserve Lineman Nick Gates exited the bus and started strolled down Broad with a beer in hand.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nRoasting Patrick Mahomes − literally\n\nSome fans had gyros. Others had hot dogs.\n\nAnd some brought a roasted Patrick Mahomes pork roast.\n\nNelson Rivera from Cape May, New Jersey, cooked it Thursday night. He said it took him four hours.\n\n“We smoked Mahomes in the Super Bowl, and we wanted to smoke him for dinner,” Rivera said.\n\nHe said he got the hair from one of his daughter’s dolls (with her permission, of course).\n\n— Martin Frank\n\n'It's a party today'\n\nAs buses made their way through their city, Howie Roseman, Eagles executive vice president, weighed in.\n\n\"It's a party today ... we're going to have a good time,\" he said.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nFans abuzz as Eagles parade well underway\n\nFrom Pattison to the Parkway, about a dozen midnight green buses ship Eagles players and others from the organization toward Broad Street as fans dozens of rows deep go crazy.\n\n\"Hopefully I don't cry because it's going to be emotional,\" said Brandon Graham, referencing his upcoming speech at the art museum. When asked whether he'd be back next season or retire on top, the defensive end said he just wanted to enjoy the parade first.\n\nLed by Offensive Player of the Year Saquon Barkley, some Eagles players exited buses and ran toward the crowd to high five paradegoers. The crowd roared as it got a chance to greet their favorite Super Bowl-winning players.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nBig Dom alert!\n\nEagles senior advisor and fan favorite Dom DiSandro holds up an Italian flag from a bus as fans cheer.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\nJalen Hurts smokes cigar as parade officially kicks off\n\nEagles players are riding double-decker buses, led by Jalen Hurts smoking a cigar while Brandon Graham holds the Lombardi Trophy as they head from Lincoln Financial Field to the parkway.\n\nStanding alongside owner Jeffrey Lurie, players are passing the Lombardi Trophy to each other as thousands of fans cheer as the team makes its way through South Philly along Pattison Avenue toward Broad Street.\n\n— Anthony Dimattia\n\n'A party on the Parkway'\n\nCharlene James called Friday morning “a party on the Parkway.”\n\nThe 68-year-old may live in Maryland these days, but nothing (let alone a 1.5-hour drive) was keeping the born-and-raised Philadelphian away today.\n\n“This is a whole party,\" she said between bouts of blaring her plastic horn in song. \"It’s bringing the city together.”\n\nJames was playing the horn and dancing along Benjamin Franklin Parkway, between City Hall and the art museum, in the moments before the parade's start.\n\nCrowds have been following a natural migration toward Philadelphia Musem of Art. By about 2 p.m., many hope to have found a spot near the Rocky Steps, to hear from Eagles players and coaches who just made the roughly 5-mile trip from South Broad Street.\n\nNo one is worried about the wait.\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nFan missed 2018 parade, makes up for it Friday\n\nJoe Merez drove in from Redding, Pennsylvania before sunrise. It was a calm drive.\n\n\"Beautiful drive in. No problems. Everyone was letting us in,\" Merez said. \"That Philly spirit is (expletive) flying.\"\n\nHe described the vibes downtown as \"immaculate.\"\n\n\"It's a family out here,\" he said.\n\nLiving away in 2018, he missed the last championship parade. That made Friday extra special.\n\n\"I was so, so jealous and now I get to experience it in 2025 and it has been a life changing experience,\" he said. \"It's going to be a great day for Philadelphia.\"\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nCrowd grows as parade start time nears\n\nThe crowd steadily increased from south to north along Broad Street as the parade neared its start time. Families and locals lined Broad Street south of Federal Avenue.\n\nAs you headed north, the crowds got larger, younger and rowdier. There wasn't any rail space, so fans should bring a chair if they can.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nCouple returns to spot where their romance began at last Eagles parade\n\nOn Friday morning, Nyhema and Jerome Stokes of Wilmington were back near the same stoop where they met at the last Eagles parade.\n\nIn 2018, they met on Broad Street between Moore and Mifflin Streets.\n\nNow married for over a year, they are celebrating an Eagles championship, Valentines Day, and an anniversary all at once.\n\nJerome Stokes, 50, appreciated being back.\n\n“It’s wonderful,” he said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nA football toss across Broad Street\n\nAt Lombard and Broad streets, fans are tossing an orange nerf football across the street.\n\nSomeone in the crowd throws a duck and is immediately booed. Then, it happens again.\n\nA police officer gets the ball back to the crowd and the Eagles fight song immediately breaks out after. When the ball is again lost and retrieved by an officer, the crowd cheers.\n\n— Nicholas Butler and Brandon Holveck\n\nGyros for breakfast?\n\nHalal Bros Kitchen, a gyro food cart, decided to anchor right in the crowd Friday, some 60 feet from the parade route. They were set up by 5 a.m. Wally Ahmed and his partner Sohaip Rahmind were already seeing plenty of business before 9 a.m.\n\n“I hope we’re prepared,” Ahmed said, all smiles.\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nCrowds growing in Philly\n\nThe crowd in the area just south of City Hall has thickened in the last hour. Any honk or extraneous noise elicits a wave of cheers.\n\nOn Locust Street, vendors are on every corner between the PATCO station and Broad Street, selling T-shirts, hoodies, hats and “Eagles shiesties.”\n\n“If you ain’t ready, get ready,” one says.\n\nAs of early Friday morning, thousands of paradegoers had already descended upon Benjamin Franklin Parkway to get as close as possible to the stage set up in front of the steps just outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe crowd was there in an anticipation to see their favorite Eagles players give celebratory speeches following the Super Bowl win over the Chiefs.\n\n— Brandon Holveck and Anthony Dimattia\n\nSEPTA delays in Delaware\n\nThe 7:34 am SEPTA train from Wilmington left more than 30 minutes late.\n\nA growing line in Wilmington led people to wait more than an hour in the cold breeze in a nearby park on the Christina River.\n\nThe train went to Marcus Hook and let a few passengers board. It then skipped Norwood altogether.\n\nJesse Angeny, Jessica Torre and 3-year-old Grayson from Chesapeake City, Maryland, were on the train and planned on going towards Lincoln Financial Field for a more family friendly experience rather than the potentially large crowds in Center City.\n\nAs Grayson cheered for the Eagles to the rest of the train's delight, Jesse said this is all of their first parades. It was Grayson's first train ride.\n\n\"We're probably just going to stay until the buses go by, and then go grab something to eat afterwards, and then probably head on back as early as we can, where the crowd gets all crazy trying to get back,\" Angeny said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nA family affair in Philadelphia\n\nThe Bautista family only had to wake up at 3:30 a.m. on Friday.\n\nSeven of them piled into the car in Delaware County, Pennsylvania to drive in the dark to a prepaid parking spot in Philadelphia. It was parade day.\n\n“They’ve been ready since yesterday,” said grandma Carmelita about her youngest grandkids, shuffling to find a video of them singing an Eagles chant last night.\n\nBryan and Christian Beam, 2 and 4 years old, joined their older brother, Vincent Petrellis, and mom, Joan Bautista, on chairs and blankets right next to the parade route on Logan Square. It takes a 6:30 a.m. arrival to get that spot, which Joan remembered from 2018.\n\nShe’s ready to see it all again. The youngest are ready to see their first Lombardi Trophy hardware.\n\n— Kelly Powers\n\nNot your typical tailgate food\n\nTeddy Warren and his nephew Desmond parallel parked a bus at Walnut and Broad Streets around 8:30 a.m.\n\nDesmond placed cones in the spot at 3:30 a.m. next to the Doubletree where many of their family members — who double as members of the tailgating group D3 Squadron — are staying.\n\nThe drivers of another parked car and a Philly garbage truck made room for the bus.\n\n“Can you believe we’re here?” Teddy told Desmond in front of the tricked-out van.\n\nTeddy has been going to Eagles games for 15 years. He acquired the bus after year three, when his wife started joining him and they wanted their own restroom.\n\nTailgates since then have brought in the whole family, and many more they meet at games. The food is anything but normal: lobster tail, steaks and lamb chops were on the menu this season.\n\n“We never just do burgers and hot dogs,” Desmond said.\n\nA few upgrades are due for the bus, including a fresh Super Bowl decal and the famous Saquon Barkley reverse hurdle.\n\n“It brings us closer,” Desmond said. “On Sunday, no matter what, we’re cooking, we’re together.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles Super Bowl parade ADA accessibility\n\nThe jumbotrons along the parade route will have amplified sound and the ceremony will host American Sign Language translators on stage during the broadcasted speaking portions of the program.\n\nSpace on the south side of Eakins Oval has been designated for wheelchairs and ADA accessibility. The space is limited and will be first come, first served, the city announced.\n\nParatransit drop-off locations for the parade will be located at 2300 Pennsylvania Ave. and 20th and Spring Garden streets.\n\nThe Eagles Autism Foundation and the City of Philadelphia created resources for the parade to aid the needs of the autism community. A recommended viewing area and access to the mobile sensory unit and sensory bags will be available. A visual schedule and additional proactive measures are available for families bringing someone with autism to the parade.\n\n— Krys'tal Griffin\n\nEarly wake-up worth it for a prime spot\n\nJade Beasley, 26, and Lauren Burns, 25 from Conshohocken, Pennsylvania got a hotel in Chinatown and woke up at 4:30 to make their way to their prime spot on the Chestnut and Broad intersection.\n\nIn their goody bag is snacks, coffee and some “liquid courage.”\n\nWhen asked what they were most excited for, the answer was simple and unanimous: “Jalen.”\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nNew Jersey train stations not yet packed, as of 8 a.m.\n\nThe train station in Lindenwold, New Jersey is not packed yet, but the lot is full and cars seem to have to go up row after row to find a spot at Lindenwold. Trains to Philadelphia arrive every five minutes.\n\n— Nicholas Butler\n\nCenter City Cheesecake Factory calls in reserves from Christiana location\n\nLauren Weiss, Jami Peterson and Jolene Harrison got called in for relief from the Christiana Mall cheesecake factory.\n\nStanding on the platform of Biden Train Station in Wilmington, the three geared up for a busy day at the Walnut Street location in Philadelphia.\n\nThey said the call came because of the many reasons some employees at the Center City location are not scheduled today, be it the parade or Valentines Day.\n\n\"They'll probably let us go down the block and see the bus go by and then get back to work,\" server Jolene Peterson of Newark said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nA more personal win\n\nAarathi Kallur, 24 and Sidhart Sathya, 25, are from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe couple drove to Philadelphia last night and stayed with friends outside of the city and got their City Hall viewing spot at 6:30 a.m.\n\nNeither were here for the 2018 parade, but agree that this second win means more to them.\n\n“Since that Super Bowl, I’ve become so much more invested in this team,” Sathya said. “It feels much more personal to me.”\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nSEPTA Delays\n\nThe line wrapping around the Christina has formed for the now-7:50 a.m. train, which was supposed to be the 7:34 a.m SEPTA train to Philadelphia as of 7:38 a.m. A Septa key card counts as a fare.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nExcited to see Jalen Hurts\n\nReggie Laster, 55, and his 21-year-old daughter Madison Laster came from Middletown to Biden Train Station in Wilmington to head to Friday's parade.\n\nIt's their first Eagles parade, and they're looking to settle down between Race and Vine Streets in Center City on the back half of the parade route.\n\nReggie Laster said he is looking forward to seeing Super Bowl MVP Quarterback Jalen Hurts, who he said silenced the critics as the season progressed.\n\n\"They've been criticized up and down all season,\" he said. \"Despite that, they persevered through it and brought us home a Super Bowl.\"\n\nMadison Laster is a seasoned Amtrak veteran, taking it often to her college, Howard University. She was too young for the 2018 parade but is excited for her first parade.\n\n\"I had to go this year, just because you never know it's gonna be our last,\" she said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nUpdates from Biden Train Station in Wilmington\n\nThe Biden Train Station in Wilmington is divided into two parts on Friday morning.\n\nSEPTA and Amtrak customers will enter through different doors and have different tracks. Passengers are asked to follow the instructions of the many employees and the barricades set up inside the station.\n\nTrack 1 is for SEPTA and Tracks 2 and 3 are for Amtrak.\n\nWilmington is the end of the SEPTA line for the parade today; their trains do not go to Claymont, Churchman's Crossing or Newark.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nFrom Alaska to the Super Bowl parade\n\nChristian Leamy is a New Castle native but came all the way from his current home in Alaska to join his 15-year-old nephew − Owen Davis from Buckeye, Arizona − in celebrating the Eagles' Super Bowl victory.\n\nLeamy, dressed in a Brian Dawkins jersey and Davis, equipped in a Kelly Green throwback Devonta Smith jersey, sat in the Biden Train Station in Wilmington waiting for their Amtrak to Gray 30th Street station. That is a quicker ride than SEPTA by a half hour, but tickets were sold out instantly.\n\nThey hoped to hunker down close to the Philadelphia Art Museum, the final destination of the parade and where players and coaches will speak to the crowd of adoring fans.\n\nIt's Davis' first Eagles event on the East Coast. Arizona has a healthy amount of Eagles fans, but the fans here are more passionate and more \"electric,\" he said.\n\nLeamy, who is 39, is no stranger to the Super Bowl parade. He was here in 2018 and couldn't miss another opportunity.\n\n\"I got a lot of s*** from the wife, but I didn't care,\" Leamy said.\n\nWhile Leamy is looking forward to seeing the players, he said the experience of being with his family and with other Eagles fans makes the Alaska trip worth it.\n\n\"Just hanging with the in the city, just like you said, just electric during that time period. It's just so much fun. It's just something I couldn't miss,\" Leamy said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nEagles fans depart Wilmington Train Station\n\nRakim Elamin arrived at the Wilmington Train Station straight from his job as an emergency medical technician at 3:30 a.m. − the first person in what would be a growing line of Philadelphia Eagles fans waiting for the first SEPTA train to the Super Bowl parade.\n\nThe train wouldn't leave the station for another two hours, leaving the 62-year-old standing in sub-freezing temperatures hours before sunrise.\n\nBut this diehard Eagles wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\"I went in 2018 and I'm not sure when I'll see it again, so I'm going up and having fun.\" Elamin said. \"It's wonderful. This is bird country.\"\n\nAlso in line was Lauren Riebel, 27, of Wilmington, who arrived at 4:45 a.m. with a pair of friends, intent on making the first train north.\n\n\"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said the Eagles season ticket holder − wearing an Eagles hat, jacket and scarf − as the line shuffled forward. \"It's important for me to be there.\"\n\nWhen station officials stopped the line after allowing 300 people onto the first train, the approximately 100 people left in line had to wait another hour for the next train.\n\nThere were six SEPTA trains leaving Wilmington for Philadelphia Friday morning on the special parade schedule. Amtrak also ran 16 trains from Wilmington before Eagles speeches were set to start at 2 p.m. All but four were sold out, with tickets ranging from $92-$175 for the coveted final seats for the 20-minute ride.\n\nWhen the first SEPTA train filled at 5:30 a.m., a collective groan was heard in line among those who realized they now had to wait until the 6:30 a.m. train.\n\nThe first of those cut-off were Calvin and Sarah Straub, a married couple from Wilmington who had arrived at 4:50 a.m.\n\nCalvin, 27, was armed with a backpack filled with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, hand warmers and canned caffeinated drinks for what was expected to be an especially long day.\n\nHe didn't go to the parade in 2018, instead watching from work. This time, he wasn't about to make the same mistake, even though he had to be at his job as a car wash manager at 7 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\"The Eagles put everything on the field, so the least we can do is put everything out for the city right now,\" Calvin Straub said. \"Even though it's probably going to take us 10 hours to get home.\"\n\n— Ryan Cormier\n\nEagles fans make the trip to Philadelphia\n\nLast-minute passengers dripping in Birds gear raced up the stairs to board the larger-than-usual SEPTA train at the Biden Train Station Friday morning.\n\nThe train was packed with Eagles fans drinking coffee and more before the sun rose. They gathered hours before the Super Bowl Parade was set to kick off near the sports complex in Philadelphia.\n\nSEPTA is running a modified schedule on the Wilmington/Newark Line, stopping only at Wilmington, Marcus Hook, Norwood and Gray 30th Street Station.\n\nIt's the first parade for Chris Dattalo and Megan McFadden, both from Wilmington and regular SEPTA riders.\n\nDattalo said he is excited to see how much alcohol these players can handle.\n\n\"I honestly was to see how much these guys who are 6 feet and 300 pounds can drink,\" he said on the train.\n\nThe 6:30 a.m. train rolled out of Wilmington a minute or two behind. The next one is in an hour.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nGETTING TO THE PARADE FROM DELAWARE: Can you take SEPTA train to Eagles' victory parade Friday? Not from Newark\n\nWhat are the best places to watch the Eagles parade?\n\nThe parade will begin at Broad Street and Pattison Avenue outside of Lincoln Financial Field and work its way up Broad Street, wrapping around the west side of City Hall and moving up Ben Franklin Parkway before ending at the art museum.\n\nTo gauge the best spot to watch the parade and subsequent ceremony, consider your tolerance to a few things: crowds, bladder stamina, cold and rowdiness.\n\nThe more crowd-averse you consider yourself, the further south you should go. As you get closer to the art museum, expect the crowds to be bigger and likelihood of a good view more improbable.\n\nOfficials said that jumbotrons will be set up along the parade route, so if you’re looking to avoid the crowds, look for a big TV that will be airing the event.\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nHow to stay safe at the Eagles parade\n\nPhiladelphia’s Office of Emergency Management will station over 50 local, state, federal and non-governmental agencies working to keep the route safe.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department will staff medic tents at the following locations:\n\n24th Street & Benjamin Franklin Parkway (south side)\n\nPennsylvania Avenue and Spring Garden Street\n\nAviator Park (19th Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway)\n\nIf you see someone who is lost or hurt, take them to the nearest tent and notify a police officer.\n\nParadegoers can also sign up for free text alerts to get information on transit, weather and public safety.

A field of 32 teams steps on the stage in Qatar for the first World Cup in the Middle East. This tournament takes place during the winter, rather than the typical summer window, due to the heat of the local climate. Games will also be played in the evening local time.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED: Visit our one-stop shop for all the World Cup information\n\nFrom opening kick to lifting the FIFA World Cup trophy, here are live updates and the latest coverage from Qatar and around the world.\n\nDespite the spectacular stadiums, beautiful Doha waterfront, and the breathtaking Lusail skyline, there's something off about this World Cup.\n\n\"If only it wasn’t all so gross,\" columnist Nancy Armour wrote.\n\nTwelve years after Qatar conveniently won the right to host, the first kick of the World Cup finally happened.\n\n“We invested for the good of all humanity,” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar’s emir, said during the opening ceremony.\n\n\"Contrary to what FIFA president Gianni Infantino would have you believe, the criticism of the Qataris is not hypocrisy nor is it unjust,\" Armour wrote. \"The stadiums, the skyscrapers, this whole event has been paid for in blood.\"\n\nAfter their opening goal was controversially disallowed, Ecuador scored twice in the first half — a score that remained through the end of the Group A matchup. Captain Enner Valencia scored the brace as the only player on the field with previous World Cup experience. His penalty kick in the 16th minute gave Ecuador the lead and extended his World Cup scoring streak to five games. Ecuador dominated the play on the field and the energy in the stands.\n\nThe loss means Qatar is the first host nation to lose the opening game of the World Cup despite its billion-dollar investment, including an opening ceremony narrated by Morgan Freeman.\n\nFIFA honors individual achievements during the tournament. Introduced in 1982, the Golden Ball is awarded to the World Cup's best player, while the Golden Boot is given to the top scorer.

Video review confirmed the tally. Valencia has scored in five consecutive World Cups for La Tri.\n\nSCORE: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador\n\nEcuador's Enner Valencia scored his 36th career goal, converting a penalty kick against Qatar in the 16th minute. Valencia earned the penalty after Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb tripped the forward, receiving a yellow card.\n\nSCORE: Qatar 0-1 Ecuador\n\nFrom a free kick hit into the 18-yard box, Ecuador's Felix Torres acrobatically kicked the ball toward forward Enner Valencia. The all-time leading scorer for Ecuador headed the ball into the back of the net, but the referee ruled it offside after video review and disqualified the goal. It would have been the fastest score in World Cup history.\n\nThe offside rule has been a source of innumerable controversial calls in soccer.\n\nFIFA only began allowing World Cup officials the ability to review video replays to confirm calls in 2018. This year it rolled out a new semi-automated, offside technology to enhance its Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system, which was used to rule Valencia's first goal offside.\n\nSCORE: Qatar 0-0 Ecuador\n\nWHAT IS OFFSIDE IN SOCCER?: Explaining the rule so you're prepared to watch the 2022 World Cup.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports provides a one-stop interactive destination for all your 2022 World Cup needs.

Qatar winger Akram Afif clapped to the fans in the stands as he ran out. — Columnist Nancy Armour at Al Bayt in Qatar\n\nEcuador's captain Enner Valencia gets a start. He scored three times in the 2014 World Cup and is the top goalscorer in Turkey's Süper Lig.\n\nSmaller than Connecticut, what Qatar lacks in size and might, it makes up for in money from oil and natural gas.

Non-alcoholic beer was to be sold, and still will be sold, on the stadium concourses.\n\nThat is no longer the case.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour is in Qatar at Al Bayt Stadium for Qatar vs. Ecuador.\n\n\"Roughly two hours before kickoff, and the Ecuador fans are already in raucous form,\" Armour said. \"There’s a large group behind one of the goals and they’re singing, chanting and waving flags.\"\n\nMeanwhile, big cheer went up in the stadium when jumbotrons showed the Qatari team getting off the bus.\n\nU.S. men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter named midfielder Tyler Adams as his captain throughout the World Cup. Adams, 23, is the youngest player to captain the USMNT at a World Cup since 1950. He has worn the armband nine times out of his 32 caps.\n\n“We’re proud to announce Tyler as the captain for the World Cup.

There is sudden death, but it could last a very long time.\n\nWitness the 2025 Stanley Cup Final between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers. Three of the first five games have gone to overtime, including one double-overtime game. The three are the most since 2014.\n\nThe Panthers were involved in an even longer game in 2023 when they beat the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. It lasted nearly a full four overtime periods and came close to going to a fifth overtime, but Florida's Matthew Tkachuk scored the winner with 12.7 seconds left in the period. It was the sixth-longest playoff game in NHL history.\n\nSo far in the 2025 NHL playoffs, 20 games have gone to overtime. There have been four double-overtime games.\n\nHere's a primer on playoff hockey overtime:\n\nHow does OT work in NHL playoffs\n\nIf the score is tied after three periods, the teams go to the dressing rooms for 15 minutes while the ice is resurfaced. Overtime periods last 20 minutes or until someone scores. It's five-on-five play (barring penalties). If no one scores in the first overtime, the process repeats and continues until someone scores.

No Masters countdown to herald the start of spring. Major League Baseball's Opening Day shelved for the foreseeable future.\n\nAside from labor disputes and wartime suspensions of play, both of which feel more predictable than what has transpired in the past several days, historic precedents are remarkably rare.\n\nGo back a century, though, and one is there: The 1919 Stanley Cup. Since 1893, it remains the only time the competition has started and not produced a winner, scrapped after Game 5 due to the ongoing influenza pandemic that struck both teams.\n\nThat March the Montreal Canadiens, crowned the National Hockey League champions after beating the Ottawa Senators in a best-of-seven playoff, trekked westward to face the Seattle Metropolitans, winners of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association.\n\nThe source of the misfortune that year owed to the final occurring at the tail end of the Spanish Flu outbreak that began in 1918 and claimed more than 600,000 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHOCKEY ON HOLD: NHL suspends regular-season games indefinitely\n\nThe teams alternated the rules of play for each game held at the 4,000-seat Seattle Ice Arena — which was no small thing.\n\nChief among the differences? Under PCHA rules each team had seven players on the ice at a time. The NHL-regulated games looked much more like modern hockey with the teams going 6-v-6.\n\nSeattle led the series 2-1, winning both games played under PCHA rules, before a scoreless draw in Game 4. The teams replayed the contest under the same NHL rules and Montreal prevailed 4-3 in overtime on March 29 after scoring four unanswered goals.\n\nHowever the \"Flying Frenchmen,\" as they were known at the time, were unable to take the ice for what would have been a decisive Game 6. Seven of the 10 Montreal players, as well as owner George Kennedy, had come down with the flu, according to the Montreal Gazette.\n\n\"The great overtime games of the series have taxed the vitality of the players to such an extent that they are in poor shape indeed to fight off such a disease as influenza,\" the Gazette wrote.\n\nAnd on April 1, organizers abandoned the series.\n\nIt's safe to say sports occupied a much different — and much smaller — piece of the cultural landscape at the time.\n\nThe event was reported with a single paragraph in the April 2 edition of the New York Times, four brisk lines at the bottom of the one sports-centric sheet of that day's edition (page 12 of 24). The story \"Emerson gives Voshell battle in long set of indoor tennis tournament\" earned top billing for readers that day.\n\nThe Vancouver Daily Sun added more context: \"The present series will go down in hockey annals as the most peculiar, as well as the most interesting, ever contested.\"\n\nAnd four days later, Montreal's veteran defenseman Joe Hall, 38, died as a result of the flu and pneumonia.\n\nHall, the oldest player in professional hockey at the time, according to the Daily Sun, had spent more than 15 years playing for several clubs. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.\n\nCoincidentally, the first international game in the history of the sport only came about because of a different outbreak in 1886.\n\nThe spread of smallpox through Montreal that winter forced the cancellation of the city's winter carnival, which featured a series of hockey games. But the Burlington Carnival of Winter Sports, 90 miles to the south, offered to host games on Lake Champlain.\n\nThe Montreal Amateur Athletic Association's game against the local skaters from the Van Ness club on Feb. 26, the final day of the carnival, became the first organized hockey game between teams from different countries.\n\nContact Austin Danforth at 651-4851 or edanforth@freepressmedia.com.

Instead, there's an international star-filled tournament.\n\nPlayers from the United States, Canada, Finland and Sweden will suit up in their national team jerseys at the 4 Nations Face-Off. It's a major gathering of star power in Montreal and Boston before the NHL returns to the Olympics in 2026.\n\nPlayers on the teams have combined for seven Hart (MVP) trophies, seven Norris (defenseman) trophies and three Vezina (goaltender) trophies. There are 35 combined Stanley Cup titles and five playoff MVP wins.\n\nThere are six goal titles, three by the Toronto Maple Leafs' Auston Matthews (USA), who scored 69 times last season. There are seven scoring titles, led by Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid's five. The three-time MVP is playing on Team Canada with reigning MVP Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nHere are 12 players to watch (three from each team):\n\n4 NATIONS FACE-OFF: Rosters, schedule, format and more\n\nUSA 4 Nations Face-Off players to watch\n\nG Connor Hellebuyck, Winnipeg Jets: He's a two-time Vezina Trophy winner and could become the first back-to-back winner since Martin Brodeur in 2007 and 2008. He's the NHL leader in shutouts (6), goals-against average (2.06) and save percentage (.925), while facing nearly 1,200 shots.\n\nD Zach Werenski, Columbus Blue Jackets: With Quinn Hughes out because of injury, Werenski takes on a greater role. He's the USA's top scorer from the blue line (59 points, tied with Hughes) and one of the front-runners for the Norris Trophy. His play has helped the Blue Jackets be in the playoff mix despite the offseason death of Johnny Gaudreau and lengthy injury absences for Boone Jenner and Sean Monahan.\n\nF Matthew Tkachuk, Florida Panthers: Tkachuk has a six-game goal streak with 13 points in that span. He gets under opponents' skin. He won a Stanley Cup last season. And he's on the team with brother Brady.\n\nOthers to watch: Matthews, Jack Eichel, Kyle Connor, Jack Hughes, Adam Fox.\n\nCanada 4 Nations Face-Off players to watch\n\nF Nathan MacKinnon, Colorado Avalanche: Last year's MVP is making a case again. He leads the NHL with 87 points and is averaging 1.6 points a game since early December. He's putting up big points even after the trade of his regular winger Mikko Rantanen in January. He and his Colorado teammates lit up Hellebuyck (5.23 goals-against average) in last season's playoffs.\n\nSam Reinhart, Florida Panthers: A 57-goal scorer last season, he's on a 44-goal pace this season. But he's a threat anytime he's on the ice and likely will play on a line with McDavid, plus on the top power-play unit. He has nine power-play goals and more important, a league-best five short-handed goals. His explosiveness means teams will have to be cautious when they're on the power play.\n\nSidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins: The Penguins captain is Canada's captain. He scored the gold-medal game overtime goal in the 2010 Olympics, scored in the championship game in 2014 and was MVP as Canada picked up a third consecutive win in best-on-best tournaments at the World Cup of Hockey in 2016. It looked like an upper-body injury might keep him out of this tournament, but he got the go-ahead to play. It's worth watching how he's affected by the injury and the two-game absence.\n\nOthers to watch: McDavid, Cale Makar, Mitch Marner, Brad Marchand, Brayden Point\n\nFinland 4 Nations Face-Off players to watch\n\nAleksander Barkov, Florida Panthers: How best to stop the powerful offenses in the tournament? Strong two-way play. Barkov is one of the best in the league. He has won the Selke Trophy twice as the league's top defensive forward. He puts up points, too, and has 11 in his last six games.\n\nMikko Rantanen, Carolina Hurricanes: Which version does Finland get? He had 64 points with Colorado before the trade and two points in six games after being moved. He'll have former Avalanche linemate Artturi Lehkonen with him on Team Finland, along with current teammate Sebastian Aho. He missed the last game before the break with an injury.\n\nJuuse Saros, Nashville Predators: Finland is known for producing top goalies, and Saros is one of them. But his numbers have dropped as the Predators have unexpectedly struggled. His 23 losses are two off his career worst and he has a sub-.900 save percentage. He never has finished below .900.\n\nOthers to watch: Aho, Roope Hintz, Mikael Granlund, Lehkonen, Anton Lundell.\n\nSweden 4 Nations Face-Off players to watch\n\nD Victor Hedman, Tampa Bay Lightning: He replaced Steven Stamkos as Lightning captain and is captain of Team Sweden. He has won two Stanley Cups, one playoff MVP award and one Norris Trophy during a stretch of six seasons as a finalist.\n\nF William Nylander, Toronto Maple Leafs: His 33 goals lead Swedish players. Seven of those have been game-winners and 25 were scored at even strength. He has 21 power-play points, third on Team Sweden.\n\nG Linus Ullmark, Ottawa Senators, or Filip Gustavsson, Minnesota Wild: In theory, Sweden would go with former Vezina winner Ullmark as their No. 1 goalie. But he has just returned from an injury, getting in two games (facing a combined 84 shots) before the tournament. Gustavsson has 22 wins in 37 starts and has won four of his last five games. Ullmark has the better goals-against average. They're even in save percentage and shutouts. It will be interesting to see how Sweden deploys its goaltenders.\n\nOthers to watch: Lucas Raymond, Jesper Bratt, Adrian Kempe, Filip Forsberg, Rasmus Dahlin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2024/06/25/sergei-bobrovsky-saves-legacy-in-florida-panthers-stanley-cup-title-win-over-edmonton-oilers/74194493007/", "title": "Sergei Bobrovsky saves legacy in Panthers' Stanley Cup win over ...", "text": "SUNRISE — Rats rained down on the Amerant Bank Arena ice.\n\nHockey sticks and gloves headed in the opposite direction, toward the heavens, as the buzzer sounded.\n\nEvery member of the Florida Panthers, those on the ice and those hopping the boards, headed toward goalie Sergei Bobrovsky as a deafening, Richter-scale worthy roar filled the arena.\n\nThe Florida Panthers are Stanley Cup champions by virtue of their 2-1 Game 7 victory over the Edmonton Oilers Monday because they did everything they had not done in the previous three games.\n\nThey scored first. They shut down the explosive Edmonton offense. They were the more aggressive team. They received goals from two stars — Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart — who previously were missing in action for this series.\n\nAnd their goaltender rediscovered his touch.\n\nFans displeased with McDavid winning MVP\n\nThe only thing that put a temporary damper on the post-game celebration was when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced Edmonton superstar Connor McDavid was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, just the sixth player in NHL history to be named MVP of the playoffs from the losing team.\n\nMcDavid, of course, was not coming onto the ice to be serenaded by boos, not to mention skate around the hundreds of rats, to pick up that trophy.\n\nBut those boos directed at the commissioner soon evaporated, turning into chants of \"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,\" the Panther faithful making clear their choice for the award.\n\nThe ear-piercing cheers continued as captain Aleksander Barkov lifted the cup and give it a ride around the ice. What the captain did next was symbolic.\n\nHe handed the trophy to Bobrovsky.\n\n\"That's the dream come true,\" Bobrovsky said. \"So many times you visualize this moment and see it from different angles, different perspectives and in real life, it's a lot better.\"\n\nWas Barkov seeking out Bobrovsky as the second man to skate with the cup a message?\n\nHell, yes it was.\n\n\"I think everyone knew it was going to go to him,\" Barkov said. \"He deserved it. He's been incredible for his whole career and finally … he deserves it.\"\n\nNobody was more appreciated during the postgame bedlam than the the 35-year-old, 14-year veteran goalie on his third team. He remained largely on one end of the ice during the chaotic hour following the game with family and friends, posing for enough photos to fill an iCloud. He was just feet from his office (at least for the first and third periods) and where the celebration began after he stopped 23-of-24 shots.\n\nAnd he had to go back 11 days to appreciate what was in front of him.\n\n\"Three losses wasn't easy,\" said Bobrovsky, who allowed one goal in the first two games and was pulled in Game 4 after allowing five goals on 16 shots.\n\n\"But to become a true champion you have to overcome adversity and that was pretty good adversity, the Stanley Cup Final you lose three in a row. But we found it. We've been down before. We found a way to get out of this.\"\n\nBobrovsky and his teammates were complimentary of McDavid, who rightfully earned the award that goes to the MVP of the entire playoffs and not just the Stanley Cup Final. While he recorded eight points in Games 4 and 5 against Florida, he was shut out in the final two games with just two shots on goal, both in Game 7.\n\nBut McDavid had eight goals and 34 assists in 25 playoff games, joining Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux as the only players to record more than 40 points in a single playoff.\n\n\"He's an unbelievable player and he got the record,\" Bobrovsky said. \"He brought them to that point and I'm happy for him.\n\n\"At the end of the day it's about only one trophy that's important, we have it.\"\n\n\"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby\" chants deep into the night\n\nAs Bobrovsky said this, fans started chanting his name again, for about the 1,823rd time this season.\n\nHe was able to then reflect on what this support has meant, especially after taking more shots off the ice following Games 4-6 than he did on the slick surface.\n\n\"I appreciate them for the whole playoff, the whole season,\" he said. \"I start hearing my name in warmups and sometimes after goals (he allowed) they are cheering my name.\"\n\nAgain, more than an hour after the final horn, after the rats all had been scooped up, after the obligatory team photo with the Stanley Cup and after the franchise had a Zamboni-sized weight lifted from its shoulders those chants started up once more as Bobrovsky skated along the glass to acknowledge the fans.\n\n\"Bob's been through it all,\" said Verhaeghe, whose goal 4:27 into the game gave the Panthers their first lead since the end of Game 3. \"He played so well.

It’s where Ali would spend hours playing with friends, growing his passion for the game with each shift down the ice.\n\nNow, Ali gets to play outdoors in front of those friends ― on a much larger scale.\n\nThe Notre Dame sophomore will join the rest of his teammates for a special Friday night contest against Penn State at Wrigley Field, the home to the MLB’s Chicago Cubs. After the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues play in the NHL’s Winter Classic on New Year’s Eve, the rink will be used to host the \"Frozen Confines\" series, which features two Big Ten doubleheaders Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe Irish and Nittany Lions get the primetime slot Friday, with puck drop scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET/7:30 p.m. CT (Big Ten Network).\n\n“I never thought I’d be able to play hockey at Wrigley Field having always watched baseball there,” said Ali, a Cubs fan. “Obviously, I’ll have a lot of friends and family coming. It’ll be a super cool atmosphere. I’m excited.”\n\nThe ‘Cup bump’ in Chicago-area hockey players\n\nAli is one of six current Notre Dame players originally from the Chicago suburbs. Seniors Hunter Weiss and Tyler Carpenter, sophomore Paul Fischer and freshmen Jimmy Jurcev and Nick Kempf were also born and raised in the shadow of The Second City.\n\nAll six grew up in a time where the Blackhawks were kings of the NHL. They made the playoffs every year from 2009-17, reaching the Western Conference Finals five times and winning three Stanley Cups (2010, 2013 and 2015). Future Hall of Fame players in Patrick Kane, Jonathan Toews, Marian Hossa and Duncan Keith helped lead a hockey revival in Chicago.\n\n“It grew my overall love for the game,” Ali said. “When you’re watching your home city win Stanley Cups, three in six years ― I think all of Chicago just rallied around the Blackhawks. It was a dynasty. It was so much fun to watch. Everyone loved watching hockey. … When you watch it on TV and they’re winning, it makes you want to be like them.”\n\nAs the popularity of the Blackhawks grew, the number of kids playing hockey in the Chicagoland area soared. Notre Dame assistant coach Andy Slaggert, who’s heavily involved in the Irish’s recruiting efforts, noticed the shift as well.\n\n“There was definitely a bump when the Hawks won the Cups, and I think it’s been pretty consistently good from that point on,” Slaggert said. “I think there was a ‘Cup bump’ in talent.”\n\nAs Slaggert noted, though, recruiting kids from the Chicago area has always been critical for Notre Dame during his 32 years with the program.\n\n“I’m just thinking back to guys like T.J. Tynan, Robbie Russo, Kevin Lind, Billy Maday — they all kind of came through the Chicago youth hockey system,” Slaggert said. “Lots and lots of guys, so it’s always going to be a place that’s a high priority for us. I think, similarly, there’s always going to be a high interest from the Chicago kids in Notre Dame. There’s mutual interest.”\n\nGetting a chance to play in an outdoor game\n\nAli was five years old when the Blackhawks played in their first outdoor game in recent memory, losing to Detroit in the 2009 Winter Classic.\n\nWhile Ali never attended any of the numerous Blackhawks outdoor games of the last 15 years, he was in attendance when Notre Dame beat Miami (Ohio), 2-1, at the NFL’s Soldier Field in Chicago in 2013.\n\n“It was super chilly out and in the middle of the day,” Ali recalled. “It was so fun to watch; it was a great game.”\n\nNotre Dame has played in a handful of outdoor games in its history, with the latest being Jan. 5, 2019, against Michigan inside Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nSlaggert also has a connection to the Blackhawks, as his son, Landon, made his NHL debut for the franchise last season. He currently plays for the organization's AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, and is expected to be in attendance Friday to watch his dad coach and his younger brother, Carter, play for the Irish.\n\n“It’s like an extension of the Christmas holiday to have him support the team Friday and spend some time with his mom,\" Andy Slaggert said.\n\nFor Chicago guys like Ali, Friday will be a dream come true.\n\n“Playing with friends and stuff on an outdoor rink, and now you’re actually playing in a game in front of a ton of fans – it’s surreal,” Ali said. “Just have to stay in the moment and enjoy it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/hockey/2020/05/20/3-ice-new-3-on-3-hockey-league-coming/5209480002/", "title": "3ICE: Star-studded coaching group to head new 3-on-3 hockey league", "text": "A few years ago at Pittsburgh Penguins rookie camp, E.J. Johnston observed the delight among a couple thousand fans as they watched a tournament of 3-on-3 contests.\n\n\"It was electric,\" Johnston recalled. \"It was end-to-end action. It was all the creativity, and goal-scoring and tic-tac-toe passing that hockey fans love.\"\n\nThe NHL's five-minute, 3-on-3 overtime period, instituted in 2015, gained almost immediate popularity and praise from hockey fans. Johnston — whose father Eddie won two Stanley Cups as a goaltender with the Boston Bruins and is a longtime member of the Penguins' front office — had an idea. If unknown prospects could entertain a crowd like that, Johnston thought, it could be hockey's next innovation.\n\nJohnston is now the CEO and founder of \"3ICE,\" a new 3-on-3 hockey league set to debut next year across North America, with several big-name coaches (six of them Hockey Hall of Famers) serving as the coaches of the eight inaugural teams. Craig Patrick, the assistant to Herb Brooks on the 1980 U.S. men's Olympic gold squad, is the league's commissioner.\n\nWHEN WILL SPORTS BE BACK: Get the latest news and information right in your inbox. Sign up here.\n\n'NOBODY SAW THIS COMING': Mega-complexes desperate to welcome youth sports back\n\n“A conversation I had with my dad was, ‘We’re going to need somebody at the top of this,’\" Johnston said. \"And his first answer was Craig Patrick.”\n\nPatrick's excitement was evident from the start; he played with Johnston's father before E.J. was even born, and their own relationship goes back 30 years. The founders are confident the breakneck style of play will attract both prospects and a fanbase.\n\n\"We’re anticipating that we’re going to be able to have a lot of exciting hockey,\" Patrick said, \"even more than the NHL’s overtime format, because we’re going to go for a lot of speed and skill throughout and we’re going to look at different rules that enable that to happen more frequently in our game. It’s just an exciting venture for me.\"\n\nThe eight coaches are: four-time Stanley Cup winner Grant Fuhr; six-time Cup winner Bryan Trottier; three-time champion Guy Carbonneau; five-time All-Star John LeClair; four-time Olympian Angela Ruggiero; four-time Stanley Cup winner Larry Murphy; three-time champion Joe Mullen; and Ed Johnston. Johnston and LeClair are the only members of the group not selected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nWho, exactly, these coaches will have on their rosters remains to be seen, but Johnston thinks assembling the player pool will be one of the easier aspects of the launch. Johnston points to specific body type — shorter, faster players, with elite hands and stick speed — and age (mid-20s to early to mid-30s) when describing a typical 3ICE player.\n\n\"These guys will have NHL pedigree. If the NHL was overtime all the time, they’d still be playing in the league,\" Johnston said. \"The creativity is really what we’re looking for.”\n\nPatrick said the goalies will need to fit that mold, too, since they will be handling the puck more often than the game is accustomed to. 3ICE will consist of 56 players — eight teams of seven individuals, with six skaters and one goaltender per squad.\n\nThe 3ICE schedule begins in June and lasts nine weeks, with all eight teams traveling to a different location each week. Currently, the league has whittled the list down to 15-20 metropolitan candidates, primarily in the Northeastern U.S. and Canada, but also the Midwest.\n\n\"We want the fans to chime in and make the case for their city,\" Johnston said. \"So if we get an overwhelming response in Columbus or Pittsburgh or Erie or Toronto, that will obviously tip the scales.\"\n\nEach stop will essentially be a different tournament — seven games total, bracket-style and single-elimination. The eight-minute halves will have a running clock. Faceoffs are discouraged. There are no penalties, only penalty shots.\n\n\"We're out to promote and sell hockey at its purest,\" Trottier said.\n\n\"It's gonna have its audience,\" he added. \"In today’s wham-bam attention span world, I think the quickness, the idea of multiple games, the idea of short periods, action action, boom boom, it’s gonna grab a lot of eyeballs.\"\n\nTo help grab those eyeballs, 3ICE partnered with TSN in Canada and CBS Sports in the U.S. to broadcast games. Johnston reached out to nearly every major network's sport properties, but, \"CBS just had the enthusiasm and the capability. Quite honestly, they have the brand and the assets that they’re going to put behind this that made us really excited,\" he said.\n\nRuggiero doesn't put much stock in being the lone female coach. It's nothing new for the first woman to play in a men's pro hockey league in the U.S. (outside of the goalie position).\n\n\"Hockey's hockey,\" she said. \"It's the same game regardless of gender.\"\n\nAmong the challenges she expects is how much she will actually be able to coach in-game, given the frenetic environment 3-on-3 provides. In her opinion, nailing the draft and the conditioning aspect of coaching will translate to success.\n\nBecause teams are guaranteed one game per weekend, the magnitude of each game will naturally be more intense, Ruggiero said. The novelty of the league should largely mitigate most competitive advantages.\n\n“Everyone’s going to be competitive,\" said Ruggiero, who recently had her first child. \"Every one of these eight coaches is going to want to win this thing. But it’ll be fun. It definitely raises the profile, having so many Stanley Cup winners, gold medalists, behind the bench.”\n\nRuggiero spent 2010-18 as a member of the International Olympic Committee. Shortly after being elected, she attended the Youth Olympics in Singapore. There, 3-on-3 basketball became, \"literally, overnight, the most popular event.\"\n\nIn 2016, Ruggiero founded her company, Sports Innovation Lab — a market research company focused on the intersection of sports, technology and the future of sport. The company's findings revealed younger generations being drawn to shorter formats with more engagement.\n\nSo when Johnston asked Ruggiero to come aboard 3ICE, it was an easy yes.\n\n\"I love the fact that we’ve already had some exposure at the NHL level in overtime,\" she said. \"Now, it’s kind of taking that one step further.\n\n“Hockey’s got to do things differently to keep the next generation engaged.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/08/2022-winter-olympics-ice-hockey-rosters-former-nhl-players/9211178002/", "title": "2022 Olympics: Former NHL players, Cup winners on hockey rosters", "text": "Eric Staal, who won a gold medal with Canada in 2010 and didn't go in 2014, had little chance of making the 2022 team.

He won a Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011 and had 730 points in 962 games. He's averaging close to a point a game in the Czech League. He also played in the 2010 and 2014 Olympics. Former NHLers Michael Frolik and Vladimir Sobotka also made the roster.\n\nValtteri Filppula, 37, Finland: He won a Stanley Cup with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008 and played more than 1,000 NHL games.

He's playing in the Kontinental Hockey League this season. This will be his second Olympics. Former NHLers Mikhail Grigorenko, Slava Voynov and Nikita Gusev also made the team for the defending Olympic gold medalists.\n\nFrans Nielsen, 37, Denmark: He played 10 seasons with the New York Islanders and five with the Red Wings, scoring 25 goals in 2013-14. He's playing this season in Germany. Denmark has qualified for the Olympics for the first time. Former NHLer Mikkel Boedker also made the team.\n\nMarcus Kruger, 31, Sweden: The role player and penalty killer played eight seasons with the Chicago Blackhawks — winning Stanley Cups in 2013 and 2015 — and one season with the Carolina Hurricanes.

He beat Sergei Bobrovsky from a sharp angle and weaved through defenders to set up Corey Perry. McDavid has 42 points, fourth best all time and five points behind Wayne Gretzky's 1985 NHL record.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk, Panthers: He looked like the Tkachuk of old. He broke a nine-game goal drought, set up Oliver Ekman-Larsson's goal and dealt out six hits. His sliding stop on an Oilers empty net goal was impressive.\n\nEvan Bouchard, Oilers: He had three assists to give him 26 this postseason, breaking Paul Coffey's NHL record.\n\nLosers\n\nPanthers' special teams: You can't give up short-handed goals in back-to-back games if you're going to close out a series. The Oilers also scored two power-play goals and now have three after getting none in the first three games of the final.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky, Panthers: This is his second two-game losing streak of the playoffs. He has given up nine goals on 39 shots in those games. He gave McDavid just enough space on the Oilers captain's first goal.\n\nCarter Verhaeghe, Panthers: He had a -3 plus-minus rating for a third consecutive game and has one point in his last seven games. Maurice moved him back to the Aleksander Barkov line to try to get him going.\n\nGame 5 highlights\n\nGame 5 recap\n\nOilers 5, Panthers 3: End of third period and regulation\n\nAs they had since the score was 4-1, the Panthers controlled play in the third. Oliver Ekman-Larsson got Florida within one, but the Panthers couldn't get the tying goal. Shots were 11-4 Florida and Stuart Skinner was strong as the Panthers pressed.\n\nOilers 5, Panthers 3: Connor McDavid scores\n\nMatthew Tkachuk slides and sweeps the puck away from the empty net to keep Florida alive but Connor McDavid picks up the loose puck and scores to put the game away.\n\nFlorida still alive.

But the refs also say that Tkachuk embellished his fall.\n\nOilers 4, Panthers 3: Oliver Ekman-Larsson scores\n\nOliver Ekman-Larsson rips a shot over Stuart Skinner's glove at 4:04. Matthew Tkachuk picks up the assist and has been a force in this game.\n\nThird period underway\n\nEdmonton needs 20 minutes to hold off Florida and force Game 6.\n\nOilers 4, Panthers 2: End of second period\n\nWhat a wild period. Edmonton emerges with a two-goal lead because Connor McDavid had an unbelievable period. He was flying down the ice and showed off his stickhandling and passing skill on the Corey Perry goal. But Florida responded well, getting a quick goal from Evan Rodrigues. The Panthers spent most of the rest of the period in the Edmonton zone and outshot the Oilers 17-10 in the second.\n\nOilers' power play short-lived\n\nEvan Rodrigues slashes Connor McDavid, who looks dangerous again on a rush. But Zach Hyman is penalized for interference and it's 4-on-4 again.\n\nOilers 4, Panthers 2: Evan Rodrigues scores\n\nEvan Rodrigues scores 14 seconds after Corey Perry.\n\nOilers 4, Panthers 1: Corey Perry scores\n\nConnor McDavid splits the defense and feeds Corey Perry on the doorstep for a power play. It was Perry's first goal of the 2024 postseason. Evan Bouchard gets his 26th assist of the postseason, an NHL record.\n\nOilers go on power play\n\nKyle Okposo called for hooking at 10:02. Panthers need to kill this off.\n\nOilers 3, Panthers 1: Matthew Tkachuk scores\n\nNot long after Panthers coach Paul Maurice said there was plenty of time left in the game, Matthew Tkachuk scores after an Edmonton turnover. He ends a nine-game goal drought. Evan Rodrigues, moved back to the second line, gets the assist.\n\nPanthers line change\n\nThe Panthers put Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe back together again. Evan Rodrigues goes to the second line.\n\nOilers 3, Panthers 0: Connor McDavid scores\n\nOilers are pouring it on again. Connor McDavid scores from a sharp angle against Sergei Bobrovsky. The crowd is silent. Evan Bouchard gets his 25th assist to tie Paul Coffey's NHL record for most by a defenseman in a single postseason.\n\nOilers 2, Panthers 0: Zach Hyman scores\n\nThe Oilers score with two seconds left in their power play. Evan Bouchard's point shot banks in off Zach Hyman's body for his first goal of the series and 15th of the playoffs. The Oilers now have two power-play goals in their past two games. Bouchard (30 points) and Connor McDavid (33rd assist) pick up the assists.\n\nOilers 1, Panthers 0: End of first period\n\nThe Oilers score short-handed again for their opening goal, but the Panthers only trail by that goal after one period. Florida went the last 14 minutes of the period without a shot on goal. Edmonton leads 10-6 in shots. Stuart Skinner makes a big save early in the game on Aaron Ekblad.\n\nEdmonton will start the second period with a power play after Florida's Niko Mikkola is called for interference.\n\nOilers go on power play\n\nAleksander Barkov is called for cross-checking Evan Bouchard.

Still 1-0 Edmonton after Panthers' brief power play expires.\n\nOilers 1, Panthers 0: Connor Brown scores\n\nFor the second game in a row, the Oilers open the scoring with a short-handed goal. This time it's Connor Brown on a breakaway after he intercepts a Brandon Montour pass. It's an unassisted goal at 5:30.

McDavid's second consecutive four-point night explains how the Oilers have gone from having the same chance of winning this series as a pile of ice shavings has surviving five minutes on the Amerant Bank Arena parking lot asphalt in June to, at worst, this series now being a 50-50 proposition.\n\nEdmonton's 5-3 Game 5 win Tuesday has turned a series once destined to conclude with the Panthers winning their first Stanley Cup to the Oilers with all the momentum and likely feeling invincible, despite trailing 3-2.\n\nEdmonton appears to be leading Stanley Cup Final\n\nIt's almost as if Edmonton returns to its hockey hotbed for Friday's Game 6 leading the series down 2-3.\n\n\"Now that we've kind of made this a series, I think they'll enjoy it a lot more,\" Edmonton coach Kris Knoblauch said of the passionate Oilers fans, in the understatement of the postseason.\n\nThat joy for Panthers fans left the building early when Connor Brown's shorthanded goal 5:30 into the game gave the Oilers a lead they never would relinquish. North Palm Beach's Jack Nicklaus did his part to get the crowd hyped by banging the drum before the puck dropped. The Golden Bear was wearing a No. 18 Panthers sweater, signifying his number of major championships.\n\nThe biggest reason the Oilers now legitimately are in reach of their sixth Stanley Cup is the best player in the series now is wearing navy blue, orange and white; and not a panther stitched to the front his sweater.\n\nMcDavid scored twice and assisted on two goals Tuesday. He helped the Oilers jumped to a 3-0 lead and hold off the Panthers, who cut the deficit to one before McDavid's empty netter with 19 seconds to play assured both teams would be making the 2,549-mile journey back to the Alberta capital for Game 6.\n\nMost believe both teams will be returning to South Florida for a decisive Game 7 Monday. And with the way Edmonton's explosive offense suddenly has found its mojo — with a lot of help from a suddenly pedestrian Bobrovsky — who can argue?\n\nWhen McDavid made it 3-0 five minutes into the second period with a goal that officially told us Bobrovsky's issues from Game 4 — he was pulled early in the second period of Edmonton's 8-1 laugher after allowing five goals on 16 shots — had carried over the Game 5. At that point, the Oilers had scored 13 of the last 14 goals in the series.\n\nThis is an offense that once it gets rolling may not stop until McDavid is skating around the Panthers arena while hoisting the Stanley Cup.\n\n\"He's been driving the bus since he got here,\" Edmonton's Zach Hyman said about McDavid. \"He's the guy leading the team. You kind of expect that from him.\"\n\nHyman finished that quote by added he didn't want to put added pressure on the 27-year-old.\n\nMcDavid's first goal came from below the face-off circle to Bobrovsky's right, one so uncharacteristic of Bobrovsky that Panthers coach Paul Maurice was caught by cameras hanging his head for several seconds in the aftermath. The shot found space between Bobrovsky and the post.\n\n\"Coming down that side of the goal, I've gone short side lots, people know that I look there,\" McDavid said. \"He was standing so I tried to put it there and found a way in.\"\n\nSuddenly, those \"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby\" chants heard so frequently during Games 1 and 2 and again during introductions before Game 5, were silenced.\n\nMcDavid's prettiest play was assist on Corey Perry's goal\n\nMcDavid's prettiest play of the night was his assist on Corey Perry's goal midway through the second period that made it 4-1 Edmonton.\n\nMcDavid went end-to-end, around one Panther at the offensive blue line and then somehow splitting two more Panthers before flicking the puck to Perry in the slot.\n\n\"I'm in that position a lot … on the breakout,\" McDavid said. \"Just tried to work my way through there.\"\n\nMcDavid now has three goals and five assists in the last two games. The Oilers team had two goals in the first two games and three in Game 3 while falling behind 0-3.\n\nNow, the momentum has flipped and Edmonton is looking to become the fifth team to come back from losing the first three games of a seven-game series in the NHL playoffs, and just the second in the Stanley Cup Final, joining the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\"It's been a fun ride,\" McDavid said. \"We're glad it's going one more (game). But that's all we've earned here, one more (game.).\"\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and golf writer for The Palm Beach Post.

Here's a recap of Wednesday's action.\n\nWatch Trump's motorcade in downtown Milwaukee\n\n(12:25 a.m.)\n\nBusiness on King Drive stayed open, but slower than usual\n\nAs speeches went on inside of Fiserv Forum, some businesses just south of the hard security zone perimeter stayed open.\n\nSome restaurants saw a steady flow of customers, mostly RNC attendees.\n\nCalderone Club and San Giorgio Pizzeria Napoletana on the 800 block of North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive took mostly walk-in patrons rather than reservations. But Calderone Club was busy with at least two larger parties.\n\nTwo performers entered Silk Exotic Downtown MKE Gentlemen’s Club, 730 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., one wearing a USA flag cowboy hat. It’s been business as usual at the club this week, apart from a difficult commute to work, said bouncer Jake, who declined to share his last name with Journal Sentinel reporters.\n\nIn the empty George Webb Restaurant, 812 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., employee DeAsia, who declined to give her last name, said she predicted foot traffic would pick up after bar close at the 24-hour restaurant, as it had the first two nights of the RNC.\n\n“I feel like it’s always like this until then,” she said.\n\n(11:45 p.m.)\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez and Bridget Fogarty\n\nDancer handing out free admission passes to Silk\n\nDancer Angela Beltran and a handful of others in matching tees — featuring an image of Trump and the words “Legends never die” — were handing out free admission passes to Silk Exotic Downtown MKE Gentlemen’s Club, at 730 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., as RNC attendees left the hard perimeter near the Hyatt Regency hotel.\n\n(11 p.m.)\n\n— Hannah Kirby\n\nBusiness as usual at Milwaukee's oldest gay bar, This Is It, but patrons say downtown has been 'a ghost town'\n\nAt least 30 people were mingling and ordering drinks in anticipation for Wednesday night's drag show at This Is It, Milwaukee's oldest gay bar, at around 10 p.m.\n\nEmployees said traffic at the Wells Street establishment today, between the 7 p.m. trivia games and the 10 p.m. drag show, seemed to track with that of other Wednesdays — with mostly regulars and familiar faces.\n\nOne bartender, however, said he thought the conservative, anti-gay rhetoric that's often associated with the GOP may have kept some people home.\n\nOne patron who asked to remain anonymous because of his career said This Is It regulars he'd normally see haven't been around this week. But he blamed it on the road closures and suspected crowdedness brought in by the RNC.\n\nSurprisingly, downtown Milwaukee is like a \"ghost town\" this week, he said, but least it's been easy to find a parking spot.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, 527 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in the United States. And while Republican legislators are responsible for these bills, many This Is It patrons said they haven't felt apprehensive about going to gay bars during the RNC.\n\nThere's also been buzz on social media this week that the RNC has contributed to a surge in Grindr users. People have taken to social media to post about seeing a surge in the LGBTQ+ dating app.\n\nEmployees and patrons said they were aware of the spike in interest, but that they hadn't yet seen an increase in foot traffic to go with it. Not yet, anyway.\n\n(10:41 p.m.)\n\n— Quinn Clark and Chris Ramirez\n\nJD Vance shouts out Wisconsin factory workers\n\nJD Vance formally accepted his nomination as the GOP vice-presidential candidate Wednesday. In it, the conservative senator said the moment is “about all of us,” including in the key swing states Republicans are hoping Vance will help attract as the VP pick.\n\n“It’s about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out-of-touch politicians are destroying their jobs,” Vance said. “It’s about the factory worker in Wisconsin, who makes things with their hands and is proud of American craftsmanship.”\n\n“It’s about the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio,” he continued, “who doesn’t understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators across the world when he could buy it from his own citizens right here in our own country.”\n\n(10:10 p.m.)\n\n— Savannah Kuchar, USA TODAY\n\nWorld War II veteran from Wisconsin wows RNC crowd\n\nSergeant William “Bill” Pekrul, a Milwaukee native and World War II veteran, told the RNC crowd that “America is still worth fighting for” during his Wednesday night speech.\n\nThe crowd cheered as Pekrul, 99, said that if Trump returned as “commander in chief, I would go back and re-enlist today.”\n\nThe theme for the third night of the convention is \"Make America Strong Once Again.\"\n\nPekrul was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Silver Star for his service in WWII. He has received additional recognition locally since, including in 2019 when he served as Grand Marshall of Milwaukee's Veterans Day Parade.\n\nA Milwaukee native, Pekrul signed up for the U.S. Army at Boys Tech High School (now Bradley Tech), according to an interview with the War Memorial Center that he gave as part of the Wisconsin Veterans Story Project. Pekrul fought with the 29th Infantry in the second wave of troops during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day.\n\n(9:33 p.m.)\n\n— Mary Spicuzza and Zoe Jaeger\n\nSenators press Secret Service for answers on Trump assassination attempt\n\nA group of senators confronted head of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle while in Milwaukee at the convention, according to a post on X by Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn.\n\n“You owe the people answers,” Blackburn can be heard saying in the video.\n\nLawmakers have raised questions and concerns in the wake of the assassination attempt against Trump about potential gaps in security.\n\n(9:29 p.m.)\n\n— Savannah Kuchar, USA TODAY\n\nRiverside Theater's marquee hypes Milwaukee's shoreline for RNC attendees\n\nWater is central to life in Milwaukee — a fact that likely surprised many RNC delegates this week.\n\nThe Cream City not only sits on Lake Michigan, but also at the confluence of three major rivers: the Milwaukee, Menomonee and Kinnickinnic.\n\nThat was exactly the message on that the Pabst Theater group highlighted Wednesday on The Riverside Theater's marquee: “We’ve got the water, baby! Over 1,400 acres of sandy beaches.”\n\nEach morning of the RNC, the theater has updated its flashing marquee with messages that are not just for visitors, but reminders to Milwaukeeans of why the city's so great.\n\nRead more\n\n(9:20 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nCalifornia’s RNC delegation unveils yellow MAGA hats\n\nEveryone knows about the red MAGA hats. But the California delegation on Wednesday changed it up with golden MAGA hats.\n\nThe convention’s largest state delegations, with over 160 delegates at the RNC, stood out in the crowd with their new hats that were given out.\n\n“We’re proud to wear them — just as much as we are Americans as we are Californians,” California delegate Charles Hilliard said.\n\nHilliard said the color was to represent California’s reputation as the Golden State.\n\nFor Hilliard, California’s presence at the RNC is a “big step” for the state’s GOP party, as the state's legislature is held by a Democratic supermajority.\n\n“We feel the tide turning,” Hilliard said in reference to the GOP flipping some California House districts, “restoring us back to the Republican values that Reagan put up when I was a child.”\n\n(9:10 p.m.)\n\n— Tristan Hernandez\n\nRobin Vos shares his thoughts on the RNC\n\nBaby Trump, anti-abortion protester cross paths\n\nOne woman in a baby Trump costume. Another holding what appeared to be an anti-abortion sign.\n\nThe pair crossed paths peacefully just west of Cathedral Square Wednesday night, nodding to each other as they passed on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I think it's wonderful that we can do this,\" said Melissa H., a Milwaukee resident dressed as Trump who declined to give her last name, citing work concerns.\n\nShe said she bought the costume about six years ago, wore it once and kept it for good measure.\n\nAs for why she got it, she said: \"I despise the man.\"\n\nIt comes with limited visibility. The only way to see where she was going was to stare through a slit of clear plastic in the costume's mouth.\n\nThat inability to make her way over curbs meant she limited her wanderings to a handful of blocks on the east side of the Milwaukee River, away from the security zone and the credentials-only \"hard\" perimeter surrounding the primary convention areas.\n\nDespite her distance from the main RNC area, she was catching the eye of passersby. One Lyft driver abruptly pulled over to take a selfie with her and others couldn't help but notice the rotund baby toddling down the street.\n\nReactions, she said, included clapping and people stopping for pictures.\n\nBut her message was less than cheerful.\n\n\"I'm scared,\" she said. \"The pick of his vice president makes it 10 times worse in my opinion, and I did not like the man as a human. I do not think he was a good leader. I do not think he's good for this country.\"\n\nAn independent voter, she expressed concern that neither Trump nor Biden, men in their late 70s and early 80s, respectively, would live to see the end of a second term.\n\n\"JD Vance scares the hell out of me,\" she said of the Ohio senator and vice presidential running mate Trump announced this week.\n\n(8:20 p.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nAttendees wear ear bandages in solidarity\n\nIn the sea of RNC attendees Wednesday night, one particular accessory stood out: ear bandages.\n\nSome attendees came to Wednesday's evening event brandishing bandages on their right ears. It may not be a TikTok beauty trend any time soon, but it's being seen as a display of solidarity with former president Donald Trump's attempted assassination Saturday.\n\nTrump made his third appearance at the RNC with a large bandage over his ear.\n\n(8:12 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nDonald Trump returns for night 3 of the RNC\n\nTrump returned to the RNC for its third night.\n\nHe walked into the arena to booming applause and a standing ovation as “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” blasted at Fiserv Forum.\n\n(8 p.m.)\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nWho is Kai Trump?\n\nKai Trump, the eldest granddaughter of Donald Trump and daughter to Donald Trump Jr., announced on social media that she will speak at the RNC.\n\n\"I am honored to be speaking at the RNC,\" Kai Trump wrote in her Instagram story Wednesday.\n\nWho is Kai Trump? Here's more on her.\n\n(7:50 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nRNC has kept Milwaukee's downtown commuters away, at least so far\n\nIt looks like the RNC has kept Milwaukee's downtown commuters at bay — so far at least.\n\nMany expected traffic to be heavy amid the convention this week due to increased security and road closures. But that wasn't the case on Monday and Tuesday — at least during peak commute hours along the Marquette Interchange where Interstate 43, I-94 and I-794 meet, according to data from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\n\nRead more\n\n(7:25 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nJustin Trudeau's half-brother campaigns for RFK Jr. at RNC\n\nA caravan of political boosters have been cruising across Milwaukee, waving flags and cheering on their presidential candidate.\n\nNo, they're not here with the RNC. They're supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the dynastic and controversial third-party candidate for president. So far, they say, the reception — even from Trump supporters — has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nKyle Kemper is the man behind the wheel of a tricked out \"Kennedy 2024\" RV that's been blaring campaign jingles around town. Like RFK Jr., Kemper hails from a powerful political family but is \"a bit of a black sheep.\"\n\nKemper is a vocal critic of his half-brother, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\"I love him through and through, but I just fundamentally disagree with what he and the Liberal Party of Canada — along with their global partners — have done,\" Kemper told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nKemper is a vaccine skeptic and a cryptocurrency true-believer. He's wary of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and believes both are captured by corporate interests. A few months ago, he sat down for a 52-minute interview with Tucker Carlson.\n\nKemper and his wife, Brittany, have been driving cross-country in their \"Kennedy 2024\" camper since May, along with their three young children: Sequoia; Charlie; and Ayla, who is 10 weeks old. They've been documenting their journey on Instagram and TikTok, and they've met up with Kennedy himself along the way.\n\nThe Kempers were inspired to support RFK Jr.'s presidential campaign after hearing him speak at a cryptocurrency conference in Miami. After the conference, they enlisted the help of Miami graffiti artists to deck out their RV in \"Kennedy 2024\" images and slogans.\n\nMilwaukeeans might've heard their campaign jingles blaring on the RV's loudspeaker. Kemper used AI to adapt John F. Kennedy's 1960 \"Kennedy for Me\" song into many different genres: reggae, reggaeton, soul, pop, dub step, choir and jazz.\n\nJoined by local Kennedy fans and a group of \"Students for Kennedy,\" the RV has been parading down Brady Street and other main drags. Early Wednesday night, they were camped out in front of the Marcus Performing Arts Center.\n\nPassersby were friendly to the Kennedy crew.\n\n\"I'm so glad he finally got Secret Service protection,\" said a woman sporting an RNC lanyard.\n\n(7:06 p.m.)\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nWhat time is JD Vance speaking tonight?\n\nVance, Trump's vice presidential pick, will speak at the convention Wednesday night.\n\nThe RNC schedule lists Vance as speaking between 9:30 and 10 p.m., CT, as the last speaker of the night.\n\n(6:58 p.m.)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nTemporary RNC police headquarters sees small protest\n\nProtesters gathered Wednesday afternoon at the building in Greendale serving as the temporary headquarters for the thousands of law enforcement officers in town for RNC security.\n\nThey were there to protest Tuesday’s fatal police shooting of 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe Jr. a few blocks away from the Republican National Convention.\n\nBlack Lives Are Sacred MKE, a group that amplifies Black voices and inspires people of faith to stand up for racial justice, organized the event.\n\n\"We want to remind the nation that these kinds of incidents are not accidents,\" organizer Jodi Delfosse said. \"It's not just a few bad apples in terms of police officers with a heavy hand and a trigger finger, this is systemic racism, and we need to change the way that we police our society.”\n\nThe activist group had placed signs in the dirt bearing the names of victims of police shootings and provided signs for attendees to hold. By 5:40 p.m., when a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter arrived, the crowd had dwindled to two people.\n\nHeather Godley stood on the sidewalk across the street from the headquarters, holding a sign that said “Stop killing people.” A few drivers honked their horns and shouted “Trump!” out the window.\n\n“There are groups in Milwaukee that have been working for months and months to make sure that outside police officers didn't come in and kill folks in Milwaukee,” said Godley, who was there with her husband, Nathan. “And that's exactly what ended up happening. So I just wanted to come out and make sure that they know that that's not acceptable, that we have to make sure that people are not gunned down like what happened in King Park.”\n\nMPD on Wednesday said that going forward, Milwaukee police officers will accompany all visiting police bicycle units.\n\n\"That's a step in the right direction,\" Delfosse said. \"It was my understanding that was going to be the plan from the get-go. … I wish it had been a proactive rather than a reactive step.\"\n\nNathan Godley said the problem is that out-of-town police aren't familiar with local communities.\n\n“They were right next to a homeless camp,\" Nathan Godley said. \"If there had been an MPD officer there, it's very likely that an officer would have known some of the people in this camp would have been skilled at de-escalating, could have used their names — and it needn't have come to this.”\n\nA lieutenant at the headquarters declined to be interviewed and directed reporters to Bridget Esser with the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs for comment. Esser did not respond Wednesday.\n\n—Adrienne Davis and Erik Handley\n\nRep. Bryan Steil on local impact of RNC, Republican unity\n\nStopping by Wisconsin Media Row Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Bryan Steil said the convention has been a great opportunity to showcase Milwaukee and Wisconsin to thousands of people who haven’t been to the city before.\n\nHe said that “long term, the benefits are great” and that the RNC would encourage other conventions to come to Milwaukee. Steil hoped the economic impact would be felt for “years to come.”\n\nFor many businesses downtown, traffic has been slower than expected during the convention. Wednesday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he heard “some concerns” for businesses in the immediate surrounding area of the RNC.\n\nAsked about the message of unity the Republican Party is promoting, Steil told the Journal Sentinel Republicans need to be unified to enact policies to combat the “reckless spending that we see in the Biden administration.”\n\n“Republicans are unified because we need to, for the sake of the country, do and work to get our country back where it needs to be,” Steil said.\n\nSteil added that the energy in Fiserv Forum is high, especially after Trump made his first appearance since Saturday’s assassination attempt. He said he’s looking forward to speeches from Senator JD Vance tonight and Trump tomorrow.\n\n(6:55 p.m.)\n\n— Tristan Hernandez\n\nParents of U.S.-Israeli hostage host meet-and-greet ahead of evening remarks\n\nRonen and Orna Neutra, the parents of 22-year-old American-Israeli hostage Omner Nuetra, hosted a meet-and-greet outside the Baird Center Wednesday afternoon. They're scheduled to speak to delegates and politicians during Wednesday night’s main remarks, one of their largest audiences yet.\n\nThey called on Republicans and Democrats to work together on a hostage deal to release the estimated 120 people still held in Gaza.\n\n“We will talk to anyone. We talk to Republicans, we talk to Democrats, we talk to people that are not in our comfort zone,” Orna said. “This is what is going to bring our hostages and our loved ones home.”\n\n“This is a bipartisan issue,” Ronen added.\n\nThey were joined by Pency Nance, the CEO and president of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee and Liz Hirsh Naftali, the relative of Abigail Mor Edan, a former American hostage in Gaza. Nance led the small group of attendees in a prayer at the end of the event.\n\n(6:50 p.m.)\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTensions between protesters dissipate after police line up near checkpoint\n\nTensions between arguing protesters outside a security checkpoint near Fiserv Forum quickly dissipated once about two dozen officers lined up along North King Drive.\n\nA crowd had been forming around a handful of protesters who were shouting at each other through bullhorns.\n\nTwo of the people were recognizable as protesters who had been antagonizing each other over the issue of abortion at a protest earlier in the week. Some of the protesters were affiliated with the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising group, which on Monday staged a “wedding” for the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party.\n\nThe area outside the pedestrian checkpoint, along King Drive at West Highland Avenue, was a point of confluence Wednesday evening for a variety of people with something to say.\n\nThere was a man with a guitar and a microphone singing Christian songs, a woman holding a large, hand-painted sign over her head that described Trump as a racist and a felon, and several apparently amateur videographers doing man-on-the-street interviews.\n\nIt was all happening as delegates and RNC guests were trying to approach the security checkpoint around 5 p.m.\n\nThe area initially had a minimal police presence. But as the tenor of the protesters’ arguments became more intense, about 70 to 80 police moved toward the scene.\n\nMost stood back, waiting. The officers who lined up — some with their bicycles in front of them — did not interact with the protesters but appeared to create a path for cars to pass by.\n\nWithin minutes, most protesters and onlookers left. A handful remained in front of the checkpoint, but they were not arguing with each other. Eventually, the officers left the area as well.\n\nThrough it all, Riverwest resident TW Hansen, a car salesman, was weaving through the crowd, trying to sell bumper stickers to people that read, “Make Milwaukee Famous Again.”\n\nHansen had made the stickers for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, but never got to distribute them because of the toned-down event. So he was there trying to “get my money back out of these, or they rot in my basement forever.”\n\nHansen, a Biden supporter, said he wasn’t bothered by the mix of people expressing their views.\n\n“The weirder the better, if you ask me,” he said. “Life is too short to allow it to be boring.”\n\nStill, he wished people would “sit down, and have a drink, or five, and a laugh, and try to sort this stuff out.”\n\nHe understood that flashy protesters can cause a spectacle, and that people like to be onlookers to something noteworthy. But Hansen was there with a simple mission.\n\n“I just love selling,” he said.\n\n(6:48 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson\n\nAll quiet at Zeidler Union Square Park protest zone\n\nZeidler Union Square Park stayed quiet late Wednesday afternoon, besides about a dozen demonstration event safety staff, a couple of dog walkers and a sunbather.\n\nSeveral protest groups that had scheduled to demonstrate were no-shows.\n\n(6:44 p.m.)\n\n— Jessica Rodriguez\n\nMPD officers will accompany all visiting police bicycle units after fatal shooting\n\nAfter a fatal police shooting a mile from the security zone of the Republican National Convention, everyone from elected officials to activists and reporters had the same question:\n\nWhy were officers from Columbus, Ohio, in King Park?\n\nMilwaukee police officials were clear before the RNC: They did not intend to use non-Milwaukee officers for \"forward-facing\" roles, and they wanted Milwaukee officers to be the ones interacting with local residents.\n\nMutual aid agreements signed by outside agencies had similar language, saying Milwaukee officers should be the ones to make arrests and requiring at least one Milwaukee officer on most assignments.\n\nOn Wednesday, Milwaukee police said they did not consider the Columbus bicycle unit to be a forward-facing unit, since it was a specialty unit primarily tasked with traffic control and responding to potential demonstrations.\n\nBut the department has since made changes. For the last two days of the convention, all bicycle units will have representation from Milwaukee police.\n\nRead more\n\n(6:30 p.m.)\n\n— David Clarey, Alison Dirr and Ashley Luthern\n\nWisconsin GOP delegates say unity will extend to state politics\n\nAs Republicans center their national convention around a message of unity, two Wisconsin delegates say the approach will also apply at the state level — on the heels of two elections lost after bruising GOP primaries.\n\n“I’ve been calling around to a lot of county chairmen — a lot of them. And there might be some differences between people in the party, but we’re all excited and united about Donald Trump. That’s the one thing — and obviously, Eric Hovde, too. But if we don’t win — it’s no fun not having the executive branch,” former Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Brad Courtney told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nRepublicans can get candidates elected at every other level, but without the executive branch — whether statewide or nationally — it’s hard to accomplish policy wins without holding the executive office, Courtney said.\n\n“So I think we are very united and very excited to do what we did in ‘16,” he said.\n\nRepublican Party of Marathon County chairman Kevin Hermening noted that the implementation of new legislative maps has resulted in some GOP primary challenges in his area. He said he’s calling on Republican candidates in the county to sign a unity pledge ahead of the Aug. 13 primary election.\n\n“If they don't sign it, that's going to send a big message to the primary voters. And honestly, I've told so many people, so many times, that primary elections are not for all voters. They're for the parties to nominate their standard bearer. Obviously, all voters can vote in it, and that's how we ended up with (former gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels) and (former state Supreme Court justice and candidate) Dan Kelly as our nominees last year — because the Democrats came out and voted for their favorite Republican,” Hermening said, clarifying that he meant the ones they thought a Democrat could defeat. “We all know that.”\n\n(5:54 p.m.)\n\n— Jessie Opoien\n\nVance delivers speech to RNC crowd at Discovery World\n\nMilwaukee is known for its many Lake Michigan landmarks, so it's only fitting that they'd serve as a backdrop for some of the top players at the Republican National Convention this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, Republican vice president candidate J.D. Vance spoke at Discovery World. Vance spoke about his reaction after the assassination attempt last weekend against Former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I was so afraid for him, and so afraid for our country,\" Vance said to the RNC crowd on Wednesday.\n\nRead more\n\n(5:50 p.m.)\n\n— Caitlin Looby\n\nTensions high outside hard security zone entry point\n\nGroups of arguing protesters are gathered at a pedestrian entry point at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue.\n\nAt least 70 to 80 officers have arrived and are largely waiting nearby. But several with bikes have lined up along the street, apparently to create a path for cars to pass.\n\nDelegates are arriving for evening events at Fiserv Forum and are passing through the checkpoint.\n\n(5:22 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson and Vanessa Swales\n\nDemocrats launch 9 billboards highlighting Vance's abortion comments\n\nDemocrats launched nine new billboards in both English and Spanish criticizing Vance's comments on a national abortion ban.\n\nAccording to reporting from CNN, Vance in 2022 said he wanted to see abortion banned nationally, because people seeking abortions would travel from states where its banned to those with liberal abortion laws. Without federal action, he said, abortion couldn't be completely stopped.\n\nVance earlier this week said he planned to adhere to Trump's view on abortion as a state issue, though.\n\n“Alabama’s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing,\" he said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Monday. \"And that’s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.”\n\nThe new ads, which feature a photo of Vance, will appear along I-94 and I-43.\n\n(5 p.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nScene outside security checkpoint on King Drive\n\nA pedestrian entry point into the hard zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue is serving as a point of confluence of a variety of protesters, activists and RNC attendees.\n\nOne woman is holding a painted sign calling Trump a racist and felon. One man with a bullhorn who has been present at several RNC protesters this week is repeating inflammatory chants.\n\nThere are also activists from the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, and amateur social media videographers, and a man singing songs with Christian messages.\n\nAll those people are standing in front of the barricades that delegates are using to enter the secure perimeter. Among those who exited vehicles into the chaotic mix Wednesday before 5 p.m. was Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde.\n\n(4:45 p.m.)\n\n— Sophie Carson and Vanessa Swales\n\nUNC fraternity students who protected American flag enter RNC\n\nThe frat boys are here.\n\nSpecifically, the group of students and fraternity members at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill whose video went viral for holding up the American flag during a pro-Palestinian protest this spring have arrived at the RNC.\n\nThe Trump campaign had announced it was inviting the group last week. The group is among the \"Everyday American Convention speakers\" joining the various sessions throughout the week.\n\nThe students gained national attention when they held up the American flag during the campus protests opposing the United States' role in funding Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas War. Many conservative leaders applauded the students' actions, calling the young men patriots.\n\n(4:33 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nWisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde chugs a beer outside Fiserv Forum\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde won a beer-chugging challenge during a live taping of the \"Ruthless Podcast\" outside Fiserv Forum. A video posted to X, formerly Twitter, showed Hovde finished his beer in about five seconds.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is also known for a beer-chugging video from 2022, in which he thanked the Tavern League of Wisconsin for endorsing him. He chugged a slightly larger beer than Hovde did Wednesday, finishing in 3.79 seconds.\n\nHovde is running against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and gave a speech at the RNC Tuesday night.\n\n(4:15 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nBusiness has been 'amazing' for one RNC vendor\n\nSequined hats. Stickers. T-shirts with a muscular version of Trump.\n\nVendors have popped up inside and around the RNC security perimeter, selling all kinds of merchandise.\n\nOne seller, Leeann Joyner, said she’s “been doing amazing” during the convention. Her top seller has been cowboy Trump hats, which cost $60 each.\n\nShe’s also selling hats with fake hair made to look like the hair of the former president.\n\nJoyner lives in Orlando, Florida, and travels across the country, selling Trump merchandise at events. She started her business during the COVID-19 pandemic to supplement her income.\n\n“I was a marketing director but I’m making more money here,” Joyner said.\n\n(4:10 p.m.)\n\n— Alex Groth\n\nVoces de la Frontera condemns death of Samuel Sharpe, man shot by Columbus, Ohio, police\n\nA day after Columbus, Ohio, police shot and killed Samuel Sharpe, an unhoused man living at a tent encampment in King Park, Voces de la Frontera released a press release condemning the shooting.\n\nSharpe was killed by five nearby officers from Columbus when they saw he was wielding a knife and lunged at another individual. The officers had ordered Sharpe to drop his weapon before shooting him.\n\nVoces de la Frontera, a grassroots nonprofit that advocates for immigrants and the Latino and Hispanic community in Wisconsin, had warned about the possible dangers of bringing out-of-town law enforcement to Milwaukee. It's a mindset shared by the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and other Milwaukee organizations.\n\nChristine Neumann-Ortiz, Voces de la Frontera executive director, said in the Wednesday press release that she feared the 4,000 additional police officers in the area would bring \"deadly encounters, particularly involving out-of-state officers who do not know our community.\"\n\nNeumann-Ortiz's statement joins ongoing community outcry from friends, neighbors and homeless and housing advocates, who knew Sharpe in the King Park area as Jehovah.\n\n\"Safer communities that build trust with local law enforcement depend on de-escalation tactics and the redirection of community tax dollars from more militaristic police operations, jails, and repression to providing necessary resources for housing, healthcare, mental health services, and other essential needs,\" Neumann-Ortiz said.\n\n(4:05 p.m.)\n\n— Natalie Eilbert\n\nScenes from outside the RNC on Wednesday\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: 'We are in the middle of a war ... but our enemy is an ideology'\n\nAt a lunch event at the Harley-Davidson Museum on Wednesday, Ohio businessman and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy told the California delegation the country is in “a war.”\n\n“We are in the middle of a war in this country — a war for the survival of the United States of America,” Ramaswamy said. “But our enemy is an ideology, a toxic ideology, but an ideology, nonetheless. Not our fellow citizens.”\n\nRamaswamy put Republicans in the role of rescuers of people whose views align more with Democrats.\n\n“I view our job as Republicans almost as the job of a liberator,” Ramaswamy said, then comparing Trump to President Abraham Lincoln. “Donald Trump, I believe, has been given the (second) chance that Abraham Lincoln ... didn’t get.”\n\nRamaswamy isn't the first high-profile speaker to make a inflammatory statement since Trump was shot.\n\nAt an earlier RNC speech, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said Democratic policies were \"a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people.\"\n\nBut that was blamed on the wrong version of a speech being loaded in a teleprompter.\n\n(4 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nWisconsin delegate's dog, Lambeau, is taking hundreds of selfies, did not meet Babydog\n\nDogs have stolen the show at the Republican National Convention — including Lambeau, a 7-year-old purebred English Labrador retriever service dog.\n\n\"I had no expectations of anything,\" Lambeau's human, Wisconsin delegate Terrence Wall, said.\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect. It's the first time to be at a convention, and I am stunned. I was worried about, 'How do I keep a low profile?' And everyone wants to talk to him and meet him.\"\n\nLambeau has gotten his photo taken at least 250 to 300 times a day, Wall said. He met someone from California at Convention Fest whose daughter saw Lambeau on TV and said, \"You gotta track him down and get a selfie.\"\n\n\"I'm just his agent,\" joked Wall, a real estate developer and former U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nSo, did Lambeau meet Babydog, who appeared on stage with her owner, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, during his speech Tuesday night?\n\n\"By total coincidence, I stepped out with him to go to the bathroom\" when Babydog came out, Wall said. \"Which is probably good, because if he saw (her), he would probably want to go greet her and lick her and say hi.\"\n\n(3:50 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWisconsin delegates united in concerns about border, economy\n\nFor Wisconsin State Treasurer John Leiber, economic growth and stability are always top of mind. As a Wisconsin RNC delegate, he said he feels the Republican Party's approach to tackling inflation is ideal compared to the \"Bidenomics\" of the past four years.\n\nLeiber and fellow Wisconsin delegate Matthew Russ walked through Wisconsin Media Row on Wednesday to share about their convention experience and issues important to them.\n\n\"The other side doesn't seem to think there was an issue, but everyone can see, you go to the gas station, go to the grocery store, it's there, and it's real,\" Leiber said of inflation. \"We need a party that's willing to address it and acknowledge it exists.\"\n\nLeiber and Russ said border security remains an issue that they hope to see addressed if Trump wins in November.\n\n\"We're letting in millions and millions of people who haven't gone through the process we have in our immigration system. We have it set up for a reason,\" Russ said. \"If too many people come in, we can't care for them, so it's really not a loving thing.\"\n\nThe pair said that they were happy to see Trump select JD Vance as his running mate, because it demonstrated that the party is focused on selecting a candidate who'll wholeheartedly support Trump in his legislative agenda and not waver from campaign promises.\n\nFor Russ and Leiber, the party feels more united in its mission than it ever has.\n\n(3:45 p.m.)\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene applauded as she enters Baird Center for book signing\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia walked into the Baird Center during Convention Fest and was met from applause from RNC attendees.\n\nGreene was escorted to a private room a little before 3 p.m. and returned to a crowd of media and RNC attendees around 3:10 p.m. for an official book signing of her book, \"MTG.\"\n\nA line of about 40 people cheered as Greene walked out. Then, they waited for their chance to get their book signed and get a photo op with her.\n\n(3:35 p.m.)\n\n— Jordyn Noennig and Alex Groth\n\nDonald Trump conducts walkthrough at the RNC\n\nTrump is conducting a walkthrough Wednesday afternoon at Fiserv Forum ahead of his acceptance speech Thursday.\n\nThe Fiserv Forum floor was cleared for the former president's rehearsal around 2:30 p.m.\n\nTrump, who was officially named the Republican nominee for president Monday, has been in attendance during the RNC speeches Monday and Tuesday nights.\n\nTrump's speech will come just days after he survived an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The wounds of that attack have been visible on Trump, who has had a white bandage over his right ear. A bullet grazed his ear when a 20-year-old opened fire at Trump on stage at the rally.\n\nTrump will likely be in attendance again Wednesday night as he hears from his son, Donald Trump Jr., and Vance, among others. Tonight's theme is \"Make America Strong Once Again.\"\n\n(3:15 p.m.)\n\n— Christopher Kuhagen\n\nKing Drive slow but steady for lunch as convention-goers spread around the city for RNC events\n\nBars and restaurants along North Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive had a slow but steady crowd for lunch.\n\nTables of officers, RNC guests and media were found around the Milwaukee Brat House, Who’s on Third and Copper on King.\n\nThree RNC guests were sitting at a table outside Copper, enjoying lunch and drinks, one sipping on a Lakefront IPA.\n\nJohnny Shae of Memphis said that it was his second time at Copper. A sign advertising brunch caught his eye.\n\n“The staff are great. They’re extremely friendly,” Shae said.\n\nPeter Marshall, owner of Copper, said business has been steady.\n\n“It’s been going really well for us, but I mean it’s not 50,000 people,” Marshall said. “It’s just nice and consistent all day long, but not overwhelming, but good. We’re happy.”\n\nMarshall, an England native, said he was most excited to see Liz Truss, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom, who served only 50 days in 2022.\n\nCopper had booked three private parties. Marshall also special ordered to-go coffee cups for officers patrolling the area, given the block doesn't have a dedicated coffee shop. He said he’s gone through hundreds of cups in three days.\n\nMany convention-goers were heading to events around Milwaukee before going to the entertainment district, where RNC speeches will start at 5:45 p.m. inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nMany RNC guests were invited to an event at American Family Field and a concert at the Harley-Davidson Museum.\n\n“I block off my morning because I’m still working, and then in the afternoon, we’re going to events and whatnot,” said Mike Andrews of Virginia. He was a guest of the RNC and staying at Saint Kate — The Arts Hotel.\n\n“Today, we’re going to an event at the ballpark and then we’re heading to the Milwaukee Public Museum for an event there,” he said.\n\nHe still made time to break away from scheduled events to check out the lakefront and take a Miller Brewery tour.\n\n“We’ve enjoyed it here,” he said.\n\n(2:30 p.m.)\n\n— Jordyn Noennig\n\nWyoming couple talk about RNC obstacles to exploring Milwaukee\n\nUnder a patio umbrella outside the Milwaukee Brat House, 1013 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., Wyoming couple Bill and Roxie Hensley ate lunch — an Italian sausage for Bill and a brat for Roxie.\n\nIt was the first time the Hensleys had gone much beyond the security perimeter during their week in Milwaukee for the RNC, they said.\n\n“I feel like we've done everything we can do inside,” said Bill Hensley, an alternate delegate for Wyoming.\n\nHe said the trek from the Wyoming delegation’s hotel in Racine has been part of the challenge, plus the delegates from their state are almost entirely first-time RNC attendees. There hasn't been anyone to explain how the convention schedule works, or if there's time to explore, Hensley said.\n\nLots of people stayed in the convention hall for hours Monday and Tuesday, he said.\n\n“If we had someone who had been here before, they could have said, ‘Hey, here's what it's gonna look like,’” Hensley said. \"We just had to figure it out on our own.”\n\nBut convention security could also be a concern, Roxie Hensley said. Ohio police shot and killed an armed man outside of the RNC perimeter Tuesday. Roxie Hensley said she originally heard that it happened inside the security perimeter until someone explained otherwise.\n\n“It’s possible since last Saturday that people have been cautious,” she said.\n\nOther convention delegates agreed that back-to-back events, meetings and evening speeches have made it difficult to explore Milwaukee beyond the convention area.\n\n“It’s been a packed schedule,” said Duke Lowrie, a Louisiana delegate, as he tried to find a security entrance on the east side of the convention Wednesday morning. “We just haven’t had time yet.”\n\n(2 p.m.)\n\n— Brittany Carloni, Indy Star\n\nOne Uber driver is trying to avoid RNC\n\nCurtis Boyd, 77, is doing his best to keep his Uber away from the RNC. But he said he has little choice when the algorithm directs him to pick up a suburban passenger heading into downtown Milwaukee, even if he’s no fan of the road closures that have helped to make it something of a ghost town for local businesses.\n\n“I just work for a bit, wherever it takes me,” Boyd told USA TODAY as he navigated his Toyota Sienna onto an interstate ramp into the city Wednesday. While recognizing he could end up doing loop after loop, driving passengers to the convention site, he said he hoped to be far from the Republican confab “as fast as possible.”\n\nBoyd is a Mississippi native who has been in Wisconsin for most of his life. He’s also a retired cab driver who, a few years ago, sold his business and moved to Uber part-time, about four to five hours a day.\n\n“It’s good money,” he said, adding that he doesn’t typically do an itemized look at the fares he’s making and wasn’t familiar with the specific surge pricing differences that are adding a few more dollars to his wallet, thanks to the RNC.\n\n(1:20 p.m.)\n\n— Sam Woodward and Darren Samuelsohn, USA TODAY\n\n3rd Street Market Hall business picking up but still below normal\n\nA walk through 3rd Street Market Hall during Wednesday's lunch hour found increased activity over Monday and Tuesday, but business still below the typical noon rush.\n\n\"It's been a little bit busier,\" said Joannah Connors, manager at Mid-Way Bakery.\n\nAlso, the food hall, 275 W. Wisconsin Ave., hosted a private event Tuesday night which boosted business, said Edgar Aispuro, owner of Criollo, a Latin American food vendor, and Johnathan Dye, founder of Mr. Dye's Pies.\n\n\"That was good,\" Dye said.\n\n(1:10 p.m.)\n\n— Tom Daykin\n\nMajor Goolsby’s slow during the day but cops, parties keep it going\n\nThe noon crowd at Major Goolsby’s, 340 W. Kilbourn Ave., on Wednesday was about 10 people. That’s been the case the last several days with the convention in town.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s been a bit slower than we like during the day, than we would prefer,” manager Jessica Mullins said. “But we’ve been really lucky because we booked parties.”\n\nMullins said if Goolsby's didn’t have any parties in the evenings, it would have been “a little bit of a letdown.”\n\nMullins said being right up against the hard security perimeter and road closures have made it difficult for pedestrians to get there.\n\nHowever, it hasn’t been difficult for the thousands of law enforcement and first responders in Milwaukee.\n\n“We have kind of become the cop bar,” Mullins said, adding the restaurant gives uniformed first responders and military 50% off discounts.\n\n“So we have had almost all the police, all day, every day, coming in, so that has helped tremendously.”\n\n(1 p.m.)\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nKristin Brey, JR Radcliffe talk about RNC Day 2: Police shooting, taking Trump's photo, slow downtown business\n\nFormer Republican congressman Scott Klug on trusting Wisconsin elections\n\nFormer Republican congressman Scott Klug stopped by Wisconsin Media Row Wednesday morning to talk about his involvement in the bipartisan Democracy Defense Project, which works to build trust in elections in multiple battleground states, including Wisconsin.\n\n\"We think there's been a lot of stories told about the 2020 election that have nothing to do with reality,\" Klug said. The RNC itself isn't the target of that message, he said.\n\n\"Let me speak bluntly as a former Republican congressman: I think there's a lot of people in here who are rabid Republicans, who believe there was election fraud in 2020. I don't think there's any evidence of it in Wisconsin, whatsoever,\" Klug said.\n\nKlug leads the project in Wisconsin with former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen and former state Democratic party chair Mike Tate.\n\nKlug said Wisconsin would be smart to look at reforms that have worked in other states, such as Nebraska's system of drafting poll workers like jurors.\n\nMaking that a requirement could stem conspiracies, he said, if \"half the people don't even want to be in the room. They're just there so they don't get arrested.\"\n\nKlug expressed support for voting early, and said it's important to find a way to start processing early votes faster. A bill to allow processing absentee ballots a day early, and prevent perceptions of \"ballot dumps,\" failed in the state Legislature this session.\n\n\"You wouldn't have the mysterious trucks in the night at the Milwaukee counting center, which exists only because the folks in the Legislature can't get it done,\" Klug said.\n\n(12:30 p.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nWednesday night speaker schedule released, includes JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr. and Milwaukee veteran\n\nThe RNC has released its Wednesday night schedule and list of speakers.\n\nThe list includes Vance and his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, as well as Donald Trump Jr.\n\nIt also includes Peter Navarro, the former director of U.S. Office of Trade & Manufacturing, who just got out of jail Wednesday morning after serving four months for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAlso speaking will be Gold Star families and several decorated veterans, in keeping with the night's theme, \"Make America Strong Once Again.\" One speaker will be Sergeant William Pekrul, a Milwaukee native who's a decorated World War II and D-Day veteran.\n\nThere will also be a musical performance by country music artist Brian Kelley and the Holy Redeemer Church of God in Christ Choir.\n\nHere are a few more of Wednesday night's speakers:\n\n6-6:30 p.m.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (South Carolina)\n\nRep.

JD Vance\n\n(12:15 p.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nMan arrested blocks from Fiserv Forum on Monday was carrying AK-47\n\nA 21-year-old man arrested blocks from the RNC on Monday was carrying an AK-47 pistol, the Milwaukee Country district attorney's office said Wednesday.\n\nThe man, identified as Donnell V. Tinsley of Milwaukee, was wearing black pants and gloves, a tan sweatshirt, a ski mask and was carrying \"a large black tactical backpack,\" according to Milwaukee police.\n\nTinsley was walking south on the 1200 block of North 11th Street, away from an RNC security checkpoint, when a Homeland Security Investigations special agent and a U.S. Capitol Police officer patrolling the area noticed him. The officers stopped him around 10:45 a.m., according to police.\n\nSearching Tinsley's backpack, officers found a fully loaded magazine containing 7.62X39-caliber rifle ammunition. They also found a \"Scream\" movie mask, flashlight, two sets of black gloves with rubber fingertips, sunglasses, an Allied Universal Security uniform shirt, two cans of spray paint and multiple empty marijuana bags, according to court documents. Tinsley didn't have a concealed carry permit for his weapon, police said.\n\nThe arrest came just days after shots were fired at Trump at his Pennsylvania rally. Officials found an AR-style rifle at the scene.\n\nThough Gov. Tony Evers reportedly sought to ban within the \"soft security perimeter\" of the RNC after the attempted assassination, state law prevented the city or Secret Service from implementing such a rule. Guns aren't allowed within the RNC's \"hard perimeter,\" which includes Fiserv Forum, Baird Center and the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena.\n\nFollowing Monday's arrest, the state will request a \"no weapons/no contact order\" within the RNC's soft perimeter for the rest of the convention, Milwaukee police said. Thursday is the last day of the convention.\n\n(Noon)\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nDemocrats attack Republicans on abortion stance\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas joined the Biden-Harris campaign in an attack on Republicans' abortion stance Wednesday morning, calling it a \"dark vision\" for America.\n\n\"The Trump-Vance ticket does not care about women,\" Escobar said during a press conference in Milwaukee.\n\n\"One in three women in America now live in a state with an abortion ban. That's one in three women of childbearing age. It is an abomination that this is the vision they have for all American women.\"\n\nAmanda Zurawski, a resident of Austin, Texas, spoke at the event about her experience after she was denied a medically necessary abortion after extreme complications with her first pregnancy. She and her husband were devastated, she said, and she hoped to have a safe abortion provided by her doctor so she could heal both mentally and physically.\n\n\"I was told to wait until I got so sick that my life was considered in danger, one of the rare exceptions where a doctor can intervene in Texas,\" she said. \"It took three days and a near-death crash into septic shock before my doctor could finally provide the health care I desperately needed.\"\n\nZurawski said, after the abortion procedure to save her life, she again crashed into septic shock and was in the intensive care unit for three days.\n\n\"My family flew in from across the country for fear that I wouldn't make it through the night,\" she said.\n\nThe abortion ban had gone back into effect only days before Zurawski found out her baby wouldn't live, and seeing Trump and supporters brag about overturning Roe v Wade has been difficult for her.\n\n\"It is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on the cruel abortion bans that nearly took my life, but they do,\" she said.\n\nWalz also addressed the concern over Biden's health, too. When asked if Biden would be able to speak on issues such as abortion without a teleprompter, Walz said he was confident, but that it's not the time for men to be delivering messages about abortion.\n\n\"As a man, it's time to shut the hell up and stand back,\" he said. \"I think it's much more important that we have the narratives of the people who are out there.\"\n\n(11:45 a.m.)\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nU.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman talks police shooting, lack of focus on abortion\n\nIn an interview on Wisconsin Media Row on Wednesday morning, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman said his convention experience is \"all positive.\"\n\nHe's been to four Republican conventions but said this has been \"the best of the four because Milwaukee's the best city. It's a hidden gem.\" He thinks constituents in his district are \"paying a little more attention\" to the RNC because it's in Milwaukee.\n\nAsked for his response to Columbus, Ohio, police shooting and killing a homeless man about a mile from the RNC Tuesday, Grothman said he saw the body camera footage.\n\n\"Some guy was trying to attack another guy with two knives,\" Grothman said. \"Sometimes on these shootings, you got to really wonder, what was the police supposed to do, right? Let the guy get stabbed to death?\"\n\nAfter little talk of abortion in the party platform and in convention speeches, Grothman said he'll take Trump's word that it's an issue left to the states.\n\n\"I don't expect to be voting on any pro-life, pro-abortion bans in the next two years that he's president ... next four years, really.\"\n\n(11:20 a.m.)\n\n— Hope Karnopp and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nMusic video featuring Amber Rose is played at RNC\n\nA music video of the song, \"Trump Trump Baby,\" was played at the RNC. The song, by Trump-supporting rapper, Forgiato Blow, is rapped to the tune of Vanilla Ice's 1990 \"Ice Ice Baby.\"\n\nAmber Rose, the model, influencer and former reality TV star who spoke Monday night, appears in the video, with Rose and Forgiato Blow donning red MAGA hats as they dance to the music.\n\nErin Reed, a writer and researcher who tracks anti-transgender legislation, posted about the video on X and said that \"the audience was silent afterwards.\"\n\n(11:05 a.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nWho is Babydog Justice? Meet the English bulldog charming RNC attendees\n\nPeople who tuned in to broadcast coverage of Tuesday evening's program at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee got an unexpected treat during a speech from West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice.\n\nJustice, a member of a prominent coal mining family who's now running for U.S. Senate, told the crowd, \"We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.\"\n\nThen the camera angle widened, bringing a short and stout bulldog into frame, tongue out, appearing to listen attentively to her owner's words.\n\nThat's Babydog Justice.

This is also the start and end point for the city-designated march route.\n\n(8:30 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nJohnson says Ohio officers appear to have saved other man's life in fatal shooting\n\nThe morning after Ohio police in town for the RNC fatally shot a homeless man, Johnson said the officers' response appeared to have saved another man's life.\n\n\"No one, absolutely no one, wanted this outcome, and I anticipate a full as well as thorough investigation,\" Johnson said. \"The deceased individual had family, had friends, and my thoughts certainly are with them. My thoughts are also with the police officers from Columbus, Ohio. I'm sure they did not expect to be drawn into a tragic situation such as the one that they were involved in yesterday.\"\n\nHe added: \"The information we have leaves a clear impression that these Columbus officers, they saved the life of an unarmed man from death or perhaps serious injury.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, five officers from Columbus, Ohio shot and killed a man identified by a cousin as Samuel Sharpe Jr., who lived in one of Milwaukee's tent encampments and was known in the near west side neighborhood around King Park.\n\nThirteen Columbus officers were holding a briefing when they saw an altercation between two people, one of whom had a knife in each hand, according to preliminary information provided by Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman late Tuesday.\n\nHe didn't drop the knives when ordered to by police and instead suddenly lunged at the other person, which is when police opened fire, Norman said.\n\nRead more here\n\n(8:20 a.m.)\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nJon Stewart explains why 'The Daily Show' canceled Milwaukee RNC plans\n\nOn “The Daily Show” Tuesday night, Jon Stewart talked about the show’s cancellation of its planned appearances in Milwaukee.\n\n“The Daily Show” was originally slated to tape its Monday through Thursday episodes in front of an audience at the Marcus Performing Arts Center. On his Tuesday night show — the first \"Daily Show\" episode since the start of the RNC — Stewart said one of the reasons for canceling Milwaukee plans was that the Marcus Performing Arts Center shifted from the soft security perimeter to the hard security perimeter.\n\n“You don’t want to be in the hard perimeter,” Stewart joked, adding that law enforcement had added “cages around the theater” and that, “We didn’t feel we’d be able to do the show effectively without people.”\n\nRead more here\n\n(7:40 a.m.)\n\n— Amy Schwabe\n\nNielsen reports more than 18 million viewers tuned in for Day 1 of the RNC\n\nMore than 18 million viewers turned on their televisions to watch the first night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, according to Nielsen, a company that measures media audiences.\n\nThat’s higher than viewership on Day 1 of the 2020 convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was about 12 million, Nielsen said in a Tuesday release. These numbers don’t include people streaming the convention online.\n\nTV coverage changed the nature of political conventions, USA TODAY has reported, making them more choreographed and strategic. In turn, viewership has dropped as audiences have started to feel like they know what to expect when they tune in. In 2020, for example, 23.8 million Americans watched broadcasts of the Republican convention, according to Nielsen, compared to 32.2 million in 2016.\n\nViewership is typically highest on the last day of the convention.\n\n(7 a.m.)\n\n— Madeline Heim\n\nWeather forecast for RNC Day 3 in Milwaukee: Pleasant temps, with a slight chance of afternoon rain\n\nAfter a steamy start to the Republican National Convention on Monday, Wednesday’s weather forecast again looks to be cooler, with a slight chance of rain in the afternoon and evening.\n\nMilwaukee will be mostly sunny Wednesday with a high of 79 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with a 20% chance of showers after 2 p.m. There’s also a 20% chance of showers in the evening before 9 p.m.\n\nThe city can expect “pleasant weather” the rest of the week, the weather service said on X, with below-average temperatures and few chances for rain.\n\n(6:30 a.m.)\n\n— Madeline Heim\n\nRNC Day 3 schedule: Here's the Republican National Convention time, events for Wednesday\n\nThe fourth official session of the convention will be at Fiserv Forum Wednesday from 5:45 to 10 p.m. The official speakers list is released mid-day ahead of the nighttime event.\n\nConvention-related events are taking place around the city and southeast Wisconsin. They include screenings of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president; a breakfast hosted by the New Hampshire GOP at Grand Geneva Forum in Lake Geneva; a delegation luncheon hosted by the Utah Republican Party at Hubbard Park Lodge; a Lakefront brewery lunch and tour hosted by Washington state delegation; the Great American Farm Fair at Malchine Farms; and two events at the Harley-Davidson Museum: a Hogs and Dogs concert in the afternoon and Europe Night in the evening.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; more information can be found here.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.

They know the name (Peggy) of the other sister, too; of his son, Philip, and of the way he maneuvered his way from an immigrant orphan who escaped the hurricane-ravaged West Indies to become George Washington’s assistant during the Revolutionary War.\n\nOne of two touring productions begins a monthlong run at the Straz Center for the Performing Arts Center in Tampa on Tuesday. Chances are good that many of the thousands who will see the show are already familiar with the score from the CD that was the highest-selling Broadway cast album of 2015 and became the first cast album to hit No. 1 on the rap albums chart.\n\nAll of the acclaim and attention came because Miranda, who had won Tonys for his first musical, “In the Heights,” picked up Ron Chernow’s dense biography of Hamilton during a vacation. Where others saw history, Miranda found inspiration for a different kind of musical, one that would incorporate a variety of musical styles, with odes to Broadway’s past and contemporary sounds through rap, hip-hop and pop.\n\nOriginally conceived as a concept album, Miranda offered a sample of what he was working on in 2009 during a “White House Poetry Jam.” He received enthusiastic support from president Barack Obama and the audience after a performance of the opening night/title song.\n\nThe album idea was set aside in favor of a musical that opened at New York’s Public Theatre in January 2015, where it quickly sold out and was extended through May. It was developed over several years with Miranda’s frequent collaborators — director Thomas Kail, orchestrator and co-arranger Alex Lacamoire and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler. The frenzy was such that commercial producers and the Public Theater brought it to Broadway by July, where it has been a sold-out hit ever since, going far beyond any show in memory in reaching audiences who had never before seen a Broadway show.\n\nThe show carries the highest top ticket price of any show on Broadway — $849 — and producers carefully schedule sales of new blocks of tickets to keep demand and prices high. They also offer $10 tickets in digital lotteries for each performance in every city.\n\n“I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show,” New York Times critic Ben Brantley wrote when “Hamilton” opened on Broadway. “But ‘Hamilton’ ... might just about be worth it — at least to anyone who wants proof that the American musical is not only surviving but also evolving in ways that should allow it thrive and transmogrify in years to come.”\n\nThe musical made Miranda a household name and brought greater familiarity to three of the production’s Tony-winning actors — Leslie Odom Jr., the original Burr; Renee Elise Goldsberry, who first played the role of Angelica, and Daveed Diggs, the original Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBut unlike some other major musicals, “Hamilton” has become the attraction, not the actors starring in it. Audiences may not instantly recognize the names of the Philip Company cast that will be performing in Tampa. It stars Joseph Morales as Hamilton, Shoba Narayan as his wife, Eliza; Ta’Rea Campbell as Angelica; Marcus Choi as George Washington; Elijah Malcomb as both John Laurens and Hamilton’s son, Philip; and Kyle Scatliffe as Lafayette and Jefferson. (Pierre Jean Gonzalez, who starred in Asolo Rep’s “The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity” is the standby for Hamilton.) John Patrick Walker is featured as King George.\n\nAudiences are responding to a cultural juggernaut, one that follows a series of ground-breaking and transformative musicals that have changed our appreciation of musical theater and our expectations.\n\nThat began in 1927 with “Show Boat,” the Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II musical that was the first to mix the usual frivolity of Broadway stage shows with more serious subject matter, like racism and misogyny. Another barrier was broken in 1943 when Hammerstein first paired with composer Richard Rodgers on “Oklahoma!” a game-changing musical that was the first to more seamlessly combine story, music and dance in a way that audiences hadn’t experienced before.\n\nLeonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim put racism and gang warfare at the heart of their “Romeo and Juliet”-inspired musical “West Side Story” in 1957, which became more of a sensation when it was turned into a hit movie in 1961.\n\nA decade later came “Hair,” the Galt McDermot, Gerome Ragni and James Rado tribal love musical that brought rock music, and counter-culture and a touch of controversial nudity to Broadway.\n\nIn 1975 came “A Chorus Line,” which altered the way Broadway musicals are created. The show, about a group of dancers auditioning for ensemble roles in a forthcoming musical, was built from interviews with real dancers talking about their experiences with director and choreographer Michael Bennett. Some of them played themselves or friends when the show opened at The Public Theatre and then became a long-running hit on Broadway.\n\nIn 1996, Jonathan Larson’s “Rent,” inspired by the Puccini opera “La boheme,” brought an honest portrayal of young artists struggling to survive in financial realities and the AIDS epidemic to the New York Theater Workshop. It gained added attention because Larson died on the night of the final off-Broadway preview, never to see what a sensation he created. It was broadcast on television last week and a 20th anniversary tour continues traveling around the country.\n\nYou could include others, such as Kander and Ebb’s “Cabaret,” which did away with glitz in dealing with serious subject matter in 1966; Sondheim and George Furth’s 1970 musical “Company,” considered Broadway’s first concept musical about the subject of romance and marriage; and “Cats,” the 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that ushered in two decades of British-born musicals, including the still-running “The Phantom of the Opera,” the longest-running musical in Broadway history.\n\nAnd then came ‘Hamilton,” which earned a record-setting 16 nominations for the 2016 Tony Awards, winning 11 (one shy of the record set by “The Producers”), including awards for Miranda’s book and score, Kail’s direction, Blankenbuehler’s choreography and Lacamoire’s orchestrations. The four also received a special Kennedy Center Honors recognition in December, the first time a show (rather than an individual) was so acknowledged.\n\nLast month, Miranda returned to the title role for a three-week run of a special engagement in Puerto Rico, where his family is from, to bring attention to the island and raise funds in the wake of devastation from Hurricane Maria.\n\nNow, Tampa audiences get to experience what all the hype is about.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/10/05/yo-green-bay-remember-these-90s-good-times/90738116/", "title": "Yo, Green Bay!

In the words of MC Hammer, let's \"break it down.\"\n\n9 Acts Who Played Green Bay in ’90s\n\n1. Ice-T: 1992 at City Centre Theater. Before “Law & Order: SVU,” before the reality show with wife Coco Austin, before the lemonade stand commercial for Geico, the rapper’s controversial rock song “Cop Killer” sparked a protest by area law enforcement officials outside the downtown Green Bay venue. Inside, fans paid $20 a ticket to hear music off a then 34-year-old Ice-T’s the “O.G. Original Gangster” and “Body Count” albums.\n\n2. MC Hammer and Boyz II Men:1992 at Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena. It was Hammer time when the 2 Legit 2 Quit Tour — flashy dance moves and iconic Hammer pants included — rolled into town so 5,900 could bust a move with “You Can’t Touch This.” Opening act Boyz II Men would return to the arena in 1995 to headline their own tour, with Montell Jordan (“This Is How We Do It”) as the opener.\n\n3. Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch: 1993 at Regency Conference Center. Four years before “Boogie Nights” launched a movie career that earned him an Oscar nomination for “The Departed” and critical raves for “The Fighter,” a 21-year-old Mark Wahlberg showed off his Calvin Kleins in Green Bay. He took the stage an hour late and performed only eight songs, but for the 1,000 screaming fans it was all worth it when the shirt came off and the briefs were visible for the “Good Vibrations” finale.\n\n4. Green Jello: 1993 at Orpheum Theatre. One of the most bizarre bands to find its way to Green Bay, the novelty rock act featured such members as Pinata Head, Cowgod and Marshall “Duh” Staxx in ridiculous costumes. Blame their visit (as openers for Testament) on the fluky success of a song called “Three Little Pigs” and its claymation video that caught the attention of MTV’s “Headbangers Ball.”\n\n5. Kevin Nealon: 1993 at St. Norbert College, De Pere. “Saturday Night Live’s” “Weekend Update” anchor and half of “girlie men” pair Hans and Franz did two stand-up comedy shows at Walter Theatre, where the ticket was a modest $13.50.\n\n6. Poison: 1993 at Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena. The band spent six days in town rehearsing for its Native Tongue World Tour, the third tour it kicked off in Green Bay.\n\n7. Onyx: 1994 at Orpheum Theatre. The rap group that landed MTV play with “Slam” was originally booked to play at Appleton East High School until the school district pulled the plug on the show due to concern over vulgar lyrics on the “Bacdafucup” album. The show was moved to Green Bay, where the band managed to drop plenty of F-bombs during a quick half-hour performance.\n\n8. “Cats”: 1994 at Weidner Center. The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay performing arts center was only a year old, and local audiences were getting their first taste of the joys of national Broadway touring shows playing in their backyard. A total of 15,145 people caught Macavity, Rum Tum Tugger and feline friends during eight shows — a run that grossed $563,276.\n\n9. MTV’s “Loveline”: 1998 at Weidner Center. Back in the day when you actually turned to MTV for dating and sex advice, co-hosts Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew Pinsky took their popular late-night TV show on the road so college students could ask provocative and embarrassing questions about LSD use and oral sex in person. More than 1,600 people turned out at UWGB.\n\n9 Fun Things That Happened in Green Bay in ’90s\n\n1. Furby and Beanie Baby mania. Anybody know where their Furby is? If you were in middle school in 1998, you no doubt begged your parents for one of the big-eyed, big-eared, Gremlin-looking fur balls that could catch a cold, play hide-and-seek, burp, pass gas and say 200 words. The must-have interactive toy disappeared from local store shelves as fast as Toy Works, Toys R Us, Shopko and Wal-Mart could get them in. It was the same era when the former greyhound race track in Kaukauna was attracting thousands with its monthly Beanie Baby shows.\n\n2. Packers player sightings at the bars: McSwiggin’s, the dance-on-top-of-the-bar tavern on Green Bay’s Main Street, was a hot spot for Packers players in the early ’90s, including quarterback Brett Favre, who often would turn up as a guest bartender. Where the players went, the women followed, which explained the popularity of other hot spots like Knights on Main and Boomers.\n\n3. “The Sunscreen Song.” The 7-minute, spoken-word song off Baz Luhrmann’s “Something for Everybody” CD was intended to give advice to graduates, but it seemed everybody could appreciate Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich’s words. The song which, among other things, advises people to dance “even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room,” was a hot spin at local radio stations in the spring of 1999, locking up the No. 1 spot on \"Out of Order at 8\" on KISS-FM and “Top 9 at 9” on WIXX-FM, and garnering seven plays a day on WQLH-FM.\n\n4. “Titanic” fever. A month after it opened on Dec. 19, 1997, “Titanic” was still selling out showings at Bay Park Cinema. Teenage girls, in particular, were coming to see it multiple times, because of fresh-faced, 23-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio. Local teens told the Green Bay Press-Gazette that friends were memorizing his lines because his character says “Wisconsin” in the film, and “in school, every locker has him all over it.”\n\n5. Camping out for concert tickets. Pop-up tents on the sidewalk, calling in sick to work, discarded pizza delivery boxes, live radio remotes ... ah, the nostalgia of trying to snag a front-row ticket to a show. Alan Jackson’s concert at Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena was such a hot ticket in 1994, one fan waited outside for 53 hours to be first in line.\n\n6. Mick Jagger at Lambeau … oh wait, April Fool’s! On April 1, 1994, WQLH-FM morning show wise guys Kathy Larkin and Doug Kauffman repeatedly aired a commercial announcing The Rolling Stones, with opener the Eagles (nice touch, guys), were playing Lambeau Field, complete with a number to call for $12 tickets. Hundreds fell for it, but it turned out the real joke was on music lovers, who had to wait 17 more years for the stadium’s first major concert (Kenny Chesney in 2011).\n\n7. Kaptain Robbie Knievel’s motorcycle jump. The son of ’70s daredevil Evel Knievel decided to one-up his father by attempting a Guinness Book of World Records motorcycle jump in 1998 in the Oneida Bingo & Casino parking lot. He did it, flying 200 feet at 85 mph from ramp to ramp to clear 17 semitrailer tractors — no hands — besting Dad’s record of 14 semitrailer tractors.\n\n8. Port Plaza Mall. Before it came tumbling down in 2012, it’s where you went for a book signing by Ann B. Davis of “The Brady Bunch” or to try to get tickets to see The Rolling Stones in Milwaukee in 1998 via the \"lottery system\" at the Ticketmaster outlet in Boston Store. Press-Gazette readers named it the No. 1 spot for people watching in 1995’s Toast of the Town Readers Poll. (The same year, their three favorite local celebrities were, in order: Mike Holmgren, Dick Bennett and Brett Favre.)\n\n9. Title Towels. Remember these? Everybody was waving one during the Packers’ Super Bowl XXXI run and again the following year. McArthur Towels in Baraboo manufactured a whopping 800,000 of them in 1997.\n\n9 Green Bay bars/clubs from the ’90s\n\n1. Sha-Boom’s\n\n2. Studio East (headbangers paradise)\n\n3. Miller’s Pub (installed go-go cages in 1993; became Murphy’s Pub by 1994)\n\n4. The Oasis\n\n5. Concert Cafe (hosted such touring acts as Buzzcocks, The Donnas, At the Drive-In, Less Than Jake)\n\n6. Grizzly Rose Saloon (“the” place for the country line dance craze)\n\n7. Maloney’s Pub\n\n8. City Lights Night Club (the former Orpheum Theatre)\n\n9.

Def Leppard (two shows), 1992\n\n5. Reba McEntire, 1993\n\n6. Bob Dylan, 1994\n\n7. Billy Ray Cyrus, 1994\n\n8. Soul Asylum, 1995\n\n9. Blues Traveler, 1996\n\n9 TV Shows Synonymous with the ’90s\n\n1. “Friends”\n\n2. “Seinfeld”\n\n3. “The X-Files”\n\n4. “The Simpsons”\n\n5. “Roseanne”\n\n6. “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”\n\n7. “Beverly Hills, 90210”\n\n8. “ER”\n\n9. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”\n\n9 Fashion Essentials of the ’90s\n\n1.

The quiz's focus — if something this broad can be said to focus — is on crime, scandal, death and disaster.\n\nBad news, to be brief.\n\nAgain, the purpose of the quiz is to entertain as much as to inform. That was a bit of a challenge with this month's potentially ghoulish theme.\n\nI tried not to be disrespectful, but at the same time I did not don an overly thick pair of kid gloves. So if you're wondering why some of the more infamous crime cases of recent decades or some of the more disastrous injustices in Memphis history aren't mentioned, it may be because I decided the memories were too tender or the subject matter too grim for this quiz context.\n\nThe first quiz focused on \"Pop Culture.\" This second quiz was similarly broad: \"Geography, Science and Weather.\" The third was pretty direct: \"Sports.\"\n\nLike its predecessors, this new quiz is a quiz that could have run for hundreds of questions instead of only 21 (because the year is 2021, see?). Crime and scandal never have been strangers to Memphis.\n\nThe answers appear at the bottom of the quiz.\n\nTHE QUESTIONS\n\n1. “Don’t shoot, G-men!” Those words were allegedly shouted by this former Public Enemy No. 1 when federal agents captured him on Sept. 26, 1933, at his hideout at 1408 Rayner in South Memphis:\n\na) Baby Face Nelson.\n\nb) Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nc) Doc Barker.\n\nd) Pretty Boy Floyd.\n\n2. According to the estimates of historians, the Memphis Yellow Fever epidemic of 1878 killed about this many people in just four months:\n\na) 710.\n\nb) 5,150.\n\nc) 25,750.\n\nd) 120,000.\n\n3. Georgia Tann became one of Memphis’ most infamous citizens in the 1950s when she was investigated for:\n\na) Selling Millington Naval Air Station secrets to the Soviet Union.\n\nb) Training her sons to rob banks, making her Memphis’ answer to Ma Barker.\n\nc) Dumping her wheelchair-using husband overboard during a Memphis Queen Line riverboat tour.\n\nd) Operating a black market in stolen-baby adoptions out of her Midtown home.\n\n4. In what a police captain described to The Commercial Appeal as \"the largest single mass arrest we've had,\" the Metro Narcotics squad apprehended 75 people for \"possession of marijuana\" and for being \"just plain drunk\" at this May 15, 1984, event:\n\na) An Ozzy Osbourne concert at the Mid-South Coliseum.\n\nb) The first \"amateur night\" contest at the Platinum Plus \"adult entertainment\" club on Mt. Moriah.\n\nc) A midnight screening of \"Evil Dead\" at the Whitehaven Cinema.\n\nd) The final night (including \"Miss Piggy\" talent show) of the Memphis in May International Festival World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest.\n\n5. Jailhouse Rock No. 1: On Nov. 24, 1976, this future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was arrested at about 3 a.m. outside Graceland, after he drove up to the gates in his Lincoln Continental Mark IV and demanded to see Elvis, while \"screaming and yelling and waving a Derringer in the air\" (according to the testimony of a guard at the gates, as quoted in The Commercial Appeal). Police confirmed that the man's \"two-shot .38 caliber Derringer\" was loaded (as, apparently, was the man). The man was:\n\na) Chuck Berry.\n\nb) Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nc) Johnny Cash.\n\nd) James Brown.\n\n6. On Feb. 23, 1892, so-called \"Memphis society girl\" turned \"tomboy\" Alice Mitchell, 19, used her father's razor blade to cut the throat of her former Higbee School for Young Ladies classmate, Freda Ward, 17. The sensational murder trial that followed has been increasingly analyzed in recent years for what the School Library Journal calls its \"sociocultural themes.\" Last year, Amazon Studios announced it is turning the case into a movie, \"Alice + Freda Forever.\" The announced director is:\n\na) Emerald Fennell (\"Promising Young Woman\").\n\nb) Jennifer Kent (\"The Babadook\").\n\nc) Kathryn Bigelow (\"The Hurt Locker\").\n\nd) Kimberly Peirce (\"Boys Don't Cry\").\n\n7. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brought a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that featured a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH staged a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appeared onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly club dancers — removed their tops and illuminated their bare chests with flashlights and cigarette lighters. MASH was an acronym for:\n\na) Memphis Appreciates Striptease History.\n\nb) Mothers Against Sexual Hypocrisy.\n\nc) Memphians Against Social Harassment.\n\nd) Mothers And Sisters in Harmony.\n\n8. On Jan. 13, 1960, this white local celebrity was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge for what an officer described as the crime of drinking in a Black cafe with Black patrons. He later hired future General Sessions Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Jr. to defend him, in what the judge handling the case told The Commercial Appeal was \"the first time he can recall\" that a white man had been represented in City Court by a Black attorney. The man was:\n\na) Professional wrestler Sputnik Monroe.\n\nb) Memphis Tigers basketball coach Bob Vanatta.\n\nc) Photographer William Eggleston.\n\nd) Sun Records founder Sam Phillips.\n\n9. In 1969, Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb caused a stir at a library board meeting when he \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from a much-debated current book that he was afraid might fall into the hands of readers under 18. Loeb was \"indignant\" that tax dollars had been spent on a book that he deemed — according to a paraphrase in The Commercial Appeal — \"too dirty for the public shelves.\" Ultimately, the library passed a policy requiring the permission of a parent or teacher for any young reader who wanted to borrow \"questionable\" volumes. The book in question was:\n\na) \"Valley of the Dolls\" by Jacqueline Susann.\n\nb) \"Myra Breckenridge\" by Gore Vidal.\n\nb) \"Portnoy's Complaint\" by Philip Roth.\n\nd) \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\" by Dr. David Reuben.\n\n10. Jailhouse Rock No. 2: On April 3, 1980, this vocalist kicked out a police vehicle's rear windows after being handcuffed and tossed into the back of a squad car, following an arrest on disorderly conduct charges in Overton Square:\n\na) Joe Strummer of The Clash.\n\nb) Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders.\n\nc) Brian Johnson of AC/DC.\n\nd) David Coverdale of Whitesnake.\n\n11. Who are Alice Marie Hovarter and Juanita Joanne Johnson?\n\na) Memphis' first two female police officers, hired in 1956 and assigned to be \"meter maids.\"\n\nb) Tag-team professional wrestlers snared in a 1973 \"sting\" operation that caught them burglarizing locker rooms at the Mid-South Coliseum.\n\nc) Third-grade classmates from St. Louis Catholic School, rescued in late 1968 after being lost for eight days in the sewer pipes and drainage ditches of East Memphis.\n\nd) Nineteen-year-old Elvis fans from Monroe, Louisiana, killed when a drunk driver from West Memphis veered into the crowd of mourners gathered outside Graceland two days after the singer's Aug 16, 1977, death.\n\n12. On Dec. 29, 1962, police seized a French-made, Memphis-set film about racial prejudice and lynching from the Studio Art Theater on Highland and charged the theater manager, William W. Kendall, with exhibiting an \"obscene\" film. As a result, the Tennessee Supreme Court two years later struck down the city's obscenity law as unconstitutional. An unlikely focus for a historic ruling, that French film, directed by Michel Gast, is now all but forgotten; but the English title under which it played in America became infamous, after it was borrowed by the makers of a controversial 1970s exploitation film that continues to be popular. That title is:\n\na) \"The Last House on the Left.\"\n\nb) \"Faces of Death.\"\n\nc) \"I Spit on Your Grave.\"\n\nd) \"Pink Flamingos.\"\n\n13. Speaking of obscenity, in 2005, motion-picture performer Harry Reems returned to Memphis for the first time since 1975, when he was indicted here on federal charges of conspiracy to distribute pornography across state lines, after an infamous movie in which he appeared was seized during its run at the Lamar Theatre. Thirty years later, Reems noted, the movie was available to guests on a pay-per-view basis at the city’s most prestigious address, The Peabody hotel, where he was staying. “I find that extremely ironic,” he said. The movie in question was:\n\na) \"Deep Throat.\"\n\nb) \"Debbie Does Dallas.\"\n\nc) \"The Devil in Miss Jones.\"\n\nd) \"For Your Thighs Only.\"\n\n14. Which of these notables is not among the 75,000 or so \"residents\" of Elmwood Cemetery?\n\na) \"Boss\" E.H. Crump.\n\nb) Author and Civil War historian Shelby Foote.\n\nc) Graceland cook Mary Jenkins Langston, who for 14 years prepared such favorites for Elvis as fried peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches and hamburger steaks.\n\nd) Watson Davis, better known as \"Sivad,\" the vampiric \"Monster of Ceremonies\" who hosted WHBQ-TV's \"Fantastic Features\" horror-movie show from 1963 to 1973.\n\n15. A story in The Commercial Appeal after his arrest described him as \"a wiry\" man \"with a crude tattoo of Batman on his left shoulder and an affinity for sunglasses.\" That man was:\n\na) James Earl Ray, 40, assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nb) Danny Owens, the \"notorious kingpin of Memphis' strip clubs\" (to quote The Commercial Appeal), charged in 1992 with racketeering and using his clubs (Gigi's Angels, Super Chics, etc.) as fronts for prostitution, gambling and money laundering.\n\nc) Memphis \"spree killer\" George Howard Putt, 23, who bludgeoned, strangled and stabbed five victims, male and female, between the ages of 21 and 80, during a monthlong \"reign of terror\" that ended when he was apprehended on Sept. 11, 1969.\n\nd) Raymond M. Green, 25, one of three men arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, in what The Commercial Appeal called \"a plot to steal the entombed body of Elvis Presley\" from Forest Hill Cemetery (before the body was moved to the \"Meditation Garden\" at Graceland).\n\n16. Jailhouse Rock No. 3: \"To tell you the truth, when he came in he didn't really say anything, he was so messed up.\" That's what an intake officer told The Commercial Appeal when asked about the 1984 arrest of this British rock-and-roller, who, according to a Memphis police report, was \"staggering drunk\" when stopped by police on Beale Street:\n\na) Ozzy Osbourne (him again??).\n\nb) Keith Richards.\n\nc) Ringo Starr.\n\nd) Rod Stewart.\n\n17. In what remains classified as the worst maritime disaster in U.S. history, a side-wheel steamboat named Sultana exploded and sank on April 27, 1865, while on the Mississippi River, just north of Memphis. The boat's passenger list of 2,137 people included more than 1,900 Union ex-prisoners of war, recently paroled from Confederate camps. The death toll was 1,168. The boat had been designed for a legal capacity of ___ passengers.\n\na) 376.\n\nb) 452.\n\nc) 1,000.\n\nd) 1,528.\n\n18. Leadfoots, beware: In 1910, Memphis officials — motivated by the car-vs.-carriage races that were occurring on its new \"parkway\" roads, which defined the space that is now more or less known as Midtown — instituted the first speed limit. That limit was:\n\na) 5 mph.\n\nb) 8 mph.\n\nc) 10 mph.\n\nd) 20 mph.\n\n19. \"Police cracked the whip on Lash LaRue last night.\" So began a story in the Sept. 28, 1956, edition of The Commercial Appeal about the arrest of LaRue, the film cowboy known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip. LaRue was in Memphis to perform in a \"Wild West\" show at the Mid-South Fair, but while here the \"movie bullwhip artist of Hollywood\" was arrested...\n\na) ... for indecent exposure, after accusations brought by the midway snake charmer, Madame Zelda.\n\nb) ... for consumer fraud, based on accusations from a soybean farmer from Helena, Arkansas. The farmer was angry because LaRue — contrary to the Wild West show's ballyhoo — had been unable to pop the top off a soda bottle with his whip.\n\nc) ... for buying and concealing stolen property — three sewing machines and an adding machine — pilfered from cars in the Fairgrounds parking lot.\n\nd) ... for public drunkenness on Beale Street, along with his famously bewhiskered movie and Wild West show sidekick, Al \"Fuzzy\" St. John.\n\n20. Buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, the notorious \"Goat Gland Doctor,\" John Romulus Brinkley, who lived much of his life in Memphis, earned a fortune and international fame for a dubious practice that nonetheless attracted hundreds of takers before he was bankrupted by lawsuits and accusations of quackery. Brinkley's nickname came from this practice:\n\na) He massaged an alleged \"goat gland\" oil into the scalps of balding male clients to promote hair growth.\n\nb) He injected so-called \"goat gland\" serum into patients with eating allergies and disorders, on the theory that goats can eat almost anything with no ill results.\n\nc) He sold mail-order \"goat gland\" pills that were said to be a cure-all for everything from the common cold to scarlet fever.\n\nd) He transplanted the testicular glands of goats into the scrotal sacs of men, to restore \"potency.\"\n\n21. On June 1, 1925, a photograph of a man from Memphis shaking hands with President Calvin Coolidge appeared in The Commercial Appeal. That Memphian was:\n\na) Tom Lee, namesake hero of the Mississippi River park that is the home base for the major events of the Memphis in May International Festival, who rescued 32 people during five trips with his small flat-bottomed boat after the steamboat M.E. Norman capsized that year on May 8.\n\nb) Captain Howard T. Fenton, commander of the M.E. Norman.\n\nc) C.P.J. Mooney, editor of The Commercial Appeal, which raised $3,000 to purchase a new home for Tom Lee and his wife in recognition of Lee's bravery.\n\nd) Mayor Rowlett Paine (who served from 1920-27), accepting an award for heroism on behalf of Tom Lee.\n\nTHE ANSWERS\n\n1.

LISTEN\n\n72. \"Cool Jerk,\" The Capitols (1966)\n\nThe myriad Detroit labels operating in the shadows of Motown during the ‘60s produced a treasure trove of soul gems. This slick, brisk dance track — released on Karen Records — was among the most commercially successful, peaking at No. 7 on the pop charts. LISTEN\n\n71. \"All Summer Long,\" Kid Rock (2008)\n\nKid Rock's nostalgic celebration of good times in northern Michigan got a musical assist from Warren Zevon's “Werewolves of London” and Lynyrd Skynyrd's “Sweet Home Alabama” to become a chart-topper around the globe.

LISTEN\n\n51. \"Ooo Baby Baby,\" The Miracles (1965)\n\nSmokey's supple vocals ride a soft bed of harmonies on one of the most tender singles ever to come out of Detroit. LISTEN\n\n50. \"Heavy Music,\" Bob Seger (1967)\n\nRock fans outside Michigan are often happily surprised to stumble onto Bob Seger's early Detroit output, exemplified by this driving, finger-snapping, bass-grooving piece of ferocity. His vocals fueled by the spirit of soul shouters like Wilson Pickett, Seger tapped into his hometown's attachment to muscular soul-rock, and the single topped the local charts in the summer of '67.\n\nThe 22-year-old Seger had already scored some local radio success — most notably “East Side Story” and “Persecution Smith” — when unleashing this one with his band the Last Heard, featuring bassist Dan Honaker, guitarist Carl Lagassa and drummer Pep Perrine. Still, broader success remained elusive, as the label Cameo-Parkway shut down that September, leaving Seger more than a year away from his national breakthrough, with “Ramblin' Gamblin' Man.” LISTEN\n\n49. \"I Second That Emotion,\" Smokey Robinson & the Miracles (1967)\n\nSmokey Robinson's reputation as one of popular music's finest songwriters was well established by the time of this peppy, endearing single. It's one of the standouts in the Miracles' repertoire, with Robinson's characteristic tinge of vulnerability, a clever Eddie Willis guitar lick and a titular refrain inspired by a line misspoken by friend and fellow songwriter Al Cleveland while shopping at the Detroit Hudson's store.\n\nThe single hit No. 1 on the R&B charts, flanked in that top spot by a trio of Detroit songs: preceded by Gladys Knight & the Pips' “I Heard it Through the Grapevine,” and followed by Aretha Franklin's “Chain of Fools” and the Tempations' “I Wish it Would Rain.” LISTEN\n\n48. \"Runaway,\" Del Shannon (1961)\n\nHarry Balk knew he had a smash on his hands. There was just some repair work to do first.\n\nDel Shannon, a Battle Creek-born singer-guitarist living in Southfield and signed to Balk's Detroit agency, had already twice traveled to New York to “Runaway” recording sessions. The song's cowriter, Max Crook, gave the track its iconic flourish: a solo played on a modified electronic organ Crook called a Musitron.\n\nThe problem: Both of Shannon's vocal passes were out of key.\n\n“I wasn't going to take any chances with that baby — the song was so great,” says Balk, now 90. “The kid wrote the song, and it was great. But he just couldn't get it together. He went flat.”\n\nSo in a painstaking process at New York's Bell Sound Studios, Shannon's vocal tape was sped up to raise the pitch, and spliced phrase by phrase with the recording's instrumental track.\n\n“I get my master and go back to Detroit,” Balk recounts. “I said, ‘OK, everybody, listen to a hell of a good record.' We start playing it, and Del Shannon starts crying — ‘Oh my god, that doesn't even sound like me!' I said, ‘Who the hell even knows what you sound like, man? Don't worry about it. When you get out there, it'll be such a smash, they'll be screaming anyway.'”\n\nBalk was right: “Runaway” spent a month atop the U.S. charts — and remained the cornerstone of Shannon's live show through his 1990 death.\n\n“We did it, we cured it, we put it out, and boom,” says Balk. “All over the world, we had a nice piece of work out there.” LISTEN\n\n47. \"Shop Around,\" the Miracles (1960)\n\nYou could say that Motown's first million seller was literally an overnight success.\n\nIn September 1960, two early versions of “Shop Around,” penned by Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy, were sputtering out on Detroit radio when Gordy struck late-night inspiration: To achieve wider success, the song needed a crisper beat and smoother delivery in place of the grittier, bluesier versions in circulation. Smokey's retelling of Mama's advice needed some zip.\n\nAs Motown legend has it, Robinson and his fellow Miracles were summoned to the Hitsville studio for an impromptu 3 a.m. session, this time with Benny Benjamin on drums.\n\nThis third “Shop Around” was gold: By Christmas, it was picking up national traction, ultimately spending two months atop Billboard's R&B chart. LISTEN\n\n► Smokey Robinson talks about the origins of \"Shop Around\":\n\n46. \"My Guy,\" Mary Wells (1964)\n\nSmokey Robinson's sugar-coated ode to romantic loyalty became the biggest hit of Mary Wells' career, and cemented her reputation as Motown's first queen.\n\nThe seeming simplicity of “My Guy” is deceptive: Robinson's stuck-like-glue couplets are delivered by Wells with sophisticated aplomb — including her throaty, Mae West-inspired final lines — and matched by a smart Funk Brothers performance that slyly dresses up the intro with a motif from the jazz standard “Canadian Sunset.”\n\n“My Guy” came amid snowballing momentum for Motown, even squeezing in a couple of weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 as the newly arrived Beatles dominated the charts in spring 1964. It was also the beginning of the end for Wells' Motown tenure: Within a year, she'd left the label amid a royalties dispute. LISTEN\n\n► Hear Peter Benjaminson, author of \"Mary Wells: The Tumultuous Life of Motown's First Superstar,\" talk about the making of \"My Guy\":\n\n45. \"Stranglehold,\" Ted Nugent (1975)\n\nOver an unrelenting, burbling bass groove, Ted Nugent delivered one of the guitar epics of the '70s — eight minutes of serpentine licks, sizzling effects and hard-rock escapism.\n\nFamously cut by Nugent in an impromptu, one-take shot with his trusted Gibson Byrdland, the \"Stranglehold\" solo wasn't just the showpiece of his 1975 self-titled debut (and a memorable highlight on 1978's \"Double Live Gonzo\"): It also sparked his status as one of the era's guitar heroes.\n\nThree decades later, Nugent would declare it “a masterpiece of jam-ology” as Guitar World magazine deemed it the 32nd best solo in rock history. LISTEN\n\n► Hear about the making of \"Stranglehold\" from Tom Werman, co-producer of Nugent's debut solo album:\n\n44. \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\" Marvin Gaye (1971)\n\nThe warm, fluttering lushness of “Inner City Blues,” the closing track on Gaye's “What's Going On,” belies its uneasy look at the urban condition circa the early '70s. Crooning the words of lyricist James Nyx, Gaye ruminates on crime, poverty and police tension, the desperation of “God knows where we're heading” capturing the mood of post-riot Detroit.\n\nThere's a reason this track became a go-to source for hip-hop samples decades later: Its gritty survey of inner-city life was a predecessor to rap as “the CNN of the ghetto,” in Chuck D's famous words.\n\nIn the context of the album, “Inner City Blues” is a coda of sorts, a musical and lyrical callback to the opening title track — and sealing what many regard as Gaye's finest artistic achievement. LISTEN\n\n43. \"You Keep Me Hangin' On,\" the Supremes (1966)\n\nRobert White's staccato guitar runs like a live wire through the Supremes' eighth No. 1 song, their edgiest Holland-Dozier-Holland production to that point.\n\nHits seemed instinctive for the Supremes and H-D-H by now, and “You Keep Me Hangin' On” found the team making a crisp, self-assured step forward. Despite the old-school flourishes — the funky rhythmic stomp, Earl Van Dyke's gospel-piano runs in the bridge — “You Keep Me Hangin' On” comes off notably modern and jetliner-sleek, with Diana Ross's lead vocal fashionably double-tracked and a 12-string guitar chiming throughout.\n\nIt was the sound of Motown emerging into a new sonic era — into color from black-and-white — and as a piece of studio work groomed with the Funk Brothers, it was one of H-D-H's best yet.\n\nBut that's not to downplay its fundamental strength as a song: “You Keep Me Hangin' On” has proved irresistible to a diverse array of artists through the decades, from Vanilla Fudge and its psychedelic sludge in 1967 to Kim Wilde's Euro-pop rendition in 1986 — not to mention the 1996 version by Reba McEntire that took the country star to No. 2 on the dance charts. LISTEN\n\n► Holland-Dozier-Holland break down \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" in this 2009 Free Press video.\n\n42. \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\" Marvin Gaye (1971)\n\nLess than a year after the inaugural Earth Day, Marvin Gaye crafted a poignant song that would become a clarion call for the budding environmental movement.\n\nAs part of the groundbreaking \"What's Going On\" album, \"Mercy Mercy Me\" was the work of an artist for whom spirituality and political action were tightly intertwined: Pollution in the skies, mercury in the seas — \"how much more abuse from man can she stand?\" Gaye sings. It was a point he'd emphasize elsewhere, telling interviewers that defying nature would prove to be the downfall of humanity.\n\n\"Mercy Mercy Me\" peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was memorialized 31 years later with a spot in the Grammy Hall of Fame. LISTEN\n\n41. \"Money (That's What I Want),\" Barrett Strong (1959)\n\nAs Barrett Strong tells it, he was at a piano fiddling around with Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\" when the bounding, bluesy part morphed into something all his own — and led to the first hit for Berry Gordy's fledgling Tamla label.\n\nThe song's official authorship — credited only to Gordy and Janie Bradford — has long been a source of dispute, and Strong contends he has been denied royalties for an enduring tune covered by the Beatles and others.\n\nRecorded in a series of live takes at the Hitsville house that would become Motown headquarters, \"Money\" featured guitar and bass by \"two little young white guys,\" Strong says — Cass Tech music students who'd popped by the studio after school. (Their identities have never been confirmed, although a musician named Eugene Grew has claimed to have been on guitar.)\n\n\"Money\" would reach No. 23 on the pop charts after getting its Detroit break via WCHB-AM's Larry Dixon: \"He said the phones lit up, and the people wanted to hear it over and over again,\" Strong recounts. \"I knew it was a hit record, because it had that same feel that ‘What’d I Say’ had, that dance feel.\"\n\nAs a performer, Strong would never again land a hit as big as \"Money,\" but that was little matter: He went on to become one of Motown's premier songwriting forces, pairing with Norman Whitfield to create blockbusters such as \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" \"War\" and \"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me).\" LISTEN\n\n► Barrett Strong talks about the making of \"Money\":\n\n40. \"You Can't Hurry Love,\" the Supremes (1966)\n\nIntroduced by one of the most distinctive bass lines in pop history — an eight-note James Jamerson figure that returns to the fore during the song's memorable break — \"You Can't Hurry Love\" became one of the signature hits in the Motown canon.\n\nWith six No. 1s to their name, the Supremes were now in the Hitsville driver's seat, and production team Holland-Dozier-Holland had the leeway to carefully groom new material: Originally titled \"This is Where I Came In,\" and with lyrics cribbed from a gospel song, \"You Can't Hurry Love\" was cut over the course of a month in summer '66, including an abandoned first version that's long been a favorite of bootleggers.\n\nThe sprightly final single was released that July, and did what Supremes releases dependably did: swooped to the top of the charts. LISTEN\n\n39. \"Let's Get it On,\" Marvin Gaye (1973)\n\nTwo years after “What’s Going On,” Marvin Gaye turned his socially conscious eye from the streets to the bedroom, and sculpted one of the definitive come-on songs in the history of popular music.\n\n“Let’s Get it On” was one of several Ed Townsend compositions on the album of the same name, and from the iconic, opening wah-wah guitar to the tapestry of multitracked vocals, the track is a masterpiece of soulful studio craftsmanship. Gaye’s performance is insistent but sensitive, and “Let’s Get it On” introduced a mature sensuality that forever changed the face of popular music.\n\nThe album — cut in Detroit and L.A. — came together amid Gaye’s move to the West Coast, where he followed Berry Gordy as Motown closed the doors on its Detroit operation. The title track was a winner out of the gate, spending two weeks atop the U.S. pop charts and six on the R&B side. LISTEN\n\n38. \"I'm Eighteen,\" Alice Cooper (1970)\n\nThe Alice Cooper band’s virile breakthrough hit was “was purely Detroit punk,” Cooper says. “You have to remember, at the time we wrote that, we were hanging out with the Stooges and the MC5. And you couldn’t get more punk than the Stooges. ... We just picked right up on that.”\n\nWritten and rehearsed at the band’s Pontiac Township farmhouse — where the group had migrated after living out of a grimy Detroit motel — “I’m Eighteen” was among the first Cooper songs to grab the ear of budding producer Bob Ezrin, who hammered it into a punchy hard-rock anthem at studio sessions in Chicago.\n\nPropelled by Cooper’s raspy vocal and the ascending dual riff of guitarists Glen Buxton and Michael Bruce, the song is a combustible mix of adolescent anger and confusion, capped with its defiant refrain: “And I like it!”\n\n“‘Eighteen’ could not be slick,” says Cooper. “It had to be a three-chord song that every single 18-year-old kid, in his worst angst moment, would get.” LISTEN\n\n► Alice Cooper looks back on \"I'm Eighteen\":\n\n37. \"Boom Boom,\" John Lee Hooker (1962)\n\nThirteen years after John Lee Hooker secured his status as Detroit's greatest bluesman with the hit \"Boogie Chillen,\" he took a shot at something more polished: For the tightly structured \"Boom Boom,\" cut in Chicago, Hooker mobilized Motown's Funk Brothers, including longtime friend Joe Hunter on piano alongside James Jamerson (bass) and Benny Benjamin (drums).\n\nWell-groomed though \"Boom Boom\" may be, a raw swagger remains in the song's aggressive seduction: \"Boom-boom-boom-boom, I'm gonna shoot you right down,\" Hooker growls. \"Right off your feet, take you home with me.\"\n\n\"Boom Boom\" has remained a favorite of rockers through the decades, with covers by bands as diverse as the Animals and Big Head Todd and the Monsters. And Hooker's scatted lines — most memorably his how-how-how-how — became a vocal signature for the Hooker-bewitched ZZ Top. LISTEN\n\n► \"Boom Boom\" is remembered by Howling Diablos front man and longtime Detroit blues figure Tino Gross:\n\n36. \"Uptight (Everything's Alright),\" Stevie Wonder (1965)\n\nThe “Little” was long gone from his name by the time Stevie Wonder at last made it back to the Top 10 following the success of “Fingertips” two years earlier.\n\n“Uptight” — three minutes of irrepressible, brass-powered joy — was a lifeline of sorts for 15-year-old Wonder, whose Motown career had stalled since that 1963 breakthrough. Reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, it also marked his emergence on the global scene, and the single hit the U.K.’s Top 20.\n\nCo-writers Hank Cosby and Sylvia Moy built the song around Wonder’s initial kernel of a chorus, tapping a classic other-side-of-the-tracks romantic trope. Wonder would go on to say the track’s feel was inspired by the Rolling Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” whose infectious guitar riff had been everywhere in summer ’65.\n\n“Uptight” showed a Stevie Wonder finding his own identity: Many have speculated that’s him on drums, serving up the song’s headlong rhythm and enthusiastic fills, and the track features many of the distinctive vocal mannerisms and playful phrasing that would define his adult singing.\n\nIt also landed Wonder his first Grammy nomination — the start of a long love affair with the Recording Academy that has placed 22 Grammys on his shelf. LISTEN\n\n► The making of Stevie Wonder's \"Uptight\" is recounted by songwriter Sylvia Moy:\n\n35. \"Baby Love,\" the Supremes (1964)\n\n“Where Did Our Love Go,” the Supremes’ first No. 1, was still riding high when Berry Gordy and Motown struck the hot iron, rushing this track into the record racks in September 1964.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Baby Love\" borrows from its predecessor single, from the floor-stomp rhythm to Diana Ross's coquettish, ooh-ing lead vocal. After all, as co-producer Eddie Holland once told a biographer, \"you'd be stupid to divert from what worked so well.\"\n\nStill, at its core, \"Baby Love\" is more layered, rich and rhythmically busy, with a dreaminess that had been missing from the group's earlier work. It was a formula that spelled instant success: The single bounded up the pop charts, spending the month of November at No. 1 and cementing the Supremes' place as America's reigning vocal group. And within a month, Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard were making their \"Ed Sullivan Show\" debut. LISTEN\n\n34. \"Smokin' in the Boys Room,\" Brownsville Station (1973)\n\nBrownsville Station was a band on the run when it cranked out one of the enduring rock 'n' roll tributes to teenage mischief.\n\nBy 1973, four years after emerging on the Detroit-Ann Arbor scene, Cub Koda, Michael Lutz and Henry (H-Bomb) Weck were road horses, logging thousands of miles and playing 300-plus dates a year.\n\n“We were given our gold records in brown paper bags while we were on the road,” says Lutz.\n\nLutz, a lifelong nonsmoker, had come up with the seed of “Smokin’ in the Boys Room,” concocting the song’s catchy chorus and guitar lick — although his line “Teacher, don’t you fill me up with your rules” was initially resisted by band mates for sounding “too British.”\n\nKoda and Lutz finished “Smokin’” together, turning a pair of devoted Chicago fans — Fang and Paul — into schoolboy partners-in-crime for the song’s tale.\n\n“Smokin’” was part of a rushed three-day recording session for the album “Yeah!” at New York’s Media Sound, overseen by fledgling producer Doug Morris, today one of the music industry’s most powerful executives. Koda supplied the song’s fittingly snarling vocals, borrowing Lutz’s 1959 Les Paul for the track’s guitar solo.\n\nKoda, who died in 2000, would joke that the album included the sound of a “taxi trunk lid closing as we were running out of the studio to catch a flight to play a gig,” says drummer Weck.\n\n“Smokin’” was Brownsville Station’s first and only Top 10 hit, but remains a rock-radio fixture to this day — with a global fan base, say Lutz, that’s “bigger than it was in its heyday.\" LISTEN\n\n► The making of \"Smokin' in the Boys Room\" as recounted by Brownsville Station's Michael Lutz and Henry Weck:\n\n33. \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" Aretha Franklin (1967)\n\nA spark of inspiration from Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler turned into one of the most acclaimed songs of Aretha Franklin’s career.\n\nIntrigued by the concept of “a natural man,” found in the old African-American folklore of figures like John Henry, Wexler switched up the idea and tossed it to songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin for fleshing out.\n\nThey quickly did, and their composition was handed to Aretha for recording during the same winter 1967 sessions that produced “Respect.” Spooner Oldham's stately gospel piano intro and Arif Mardin’s lovely strings were the dressing for a track Aretha fully made her own.\n\nBacked by her sisters, Carolyn and Erma, Franklin delivered a performance both spiritual and sensual, intimate and majestic. It was a delivery \"so free and feminine and warm,\" as a gushing Lena Horne would tell Ebony magazine — and perhaps burnished by the head cold Franklin had taken to the studio that day.\n\nKing looked back on the song in her fittingly titled 2012 autobiography, “A Natural Woman.”\n\n“Hearing Aretha’s performance of ‘Natural Woman’ for the first time, I experienced a rare speechless moment. To this day I can’t convey how I felt in mere words,” she wrote. “Anyone who had written a song in 1967 hoping it would be performed by a singer who could take it to the highest level of excellence, emotional connection and public exposure would surely have wanted that singer to be Aretha Franklin.” LISTEN\n\n32. \"For Once in My Life,\" Stevie Wonder (1968)\n\nIn 1968, “For Once in My Life” sounded less like your typical Motown fare and more like some great lost American standard.\n\nThe Ron Miller-penned tune had been performed by a host of artists before Stevie Wonder put his memorable stamp on it — indeed, \"who did it first?\" has been a topic of dispute. Of this there’s no doubt: “For Once in My Life,” to that point usually tackled as a ballad, was performed by singers that included Jo Thompson, Sherry Kaye, Connie Haines, Barbara McNair, Jean DuShon and the Temptations.\n\nTony Bennett, who’d been introduced to Miller during a gig at Detroit’s Roostertail club, enthusiastically embraced the song, scoring a hit on easy-listening radio and singing it for a national TV audience on Dean Martin's variety program in early 1968.\n\nBut it was Wonder’s upbeat, sun-streaked release later that year — driven by infectious James Jamerson bass work — that truly broke through, hitting No. 2 on the pop and R&B charts. Wonder and Bennett would team up on the song four decades later, earning a 2007 Grammy for their effort. LISTEN\n\n31. \"Reach Out I'll Be There,\" Four Tops (1966)\n\nToday, “Reach Out I’ll Be There” is a cornerstone of the Four Tops’ catalog. But for a while in 1966, says the group’s Duke Fakir, “we were seriously, totally against that song.”\n\nIt came amid a revolutionary stretch for pop music, as albums such as the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\" and the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" pushed creative boundaries and turned the studio into a laboratory. Producers Brian Holland, Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier were in an adventurous mood when they crafted “Reach Out,” with its piccolo intro and its skittering beat hammered out on a tambourine head. Lead vocalist Levi Stubbs was prodded to deliver the verses in a sing-talk style — a la Bob Dylan — before being pushed to the top of his range.\n\n“To us it was like an experiment, because it felt so different from our other songs,” says Fakir. “We thought it was an album song.”\n\nBut Berry Gordy had a different idea: Summoning the Tops into his office a couple of weeks later, he advised the group to get its tax affairs in order, “because we’re getting ready to have the biggest hit you’ve ever had.”\n\nThe group remained unconvinced.\n\nFakir’s epiphany came when he heard “Reach Out” come over his car radio for the first time that summer, and he realized that the Tops had helped create an epic for the ages. Ducking into Gordy’s office later that day, Fakir told the Motown boss he’d never doubt his ears again. “Reach Out I’ll be There” went on to spend two weeks atop both the pop and R&B charts.\n\n“I like it as much (for the lyrics) as the rhythm and sound,” he says. “The words meant so much, not only as a love song to one person — it was a song for the world.” LISTEN\n\n► The Four Tops' Duke Fakir looks back on \"Reach Out I'll Be There\":\n\n30. \"My Cherie Amour,\" Stevie Wonder (1969)\n\nStevie Wonder was in a hit groove with collaborators Sylvia Moy and Hank Cosby when they reworked a tune he'd thrown together while attending the Michigan School for the Blind.\n\n\"He had quite a few things like that,\" Moy says of the ditty initially titled \"Oh My Marsha.\" \"He was always on a piano somewhere.\"\n\nMoy wrote new lyrics and reworked the song's title refrain — she'd loved French since her Northern High School days — and Stevie had a wistful, breezy new song on his hands.\n\n\"I wanted to open his market some, more (toward) pop,\" she says. \"When you've got some creativity in you like that, you just follow that.\"\n\nStill, \"there were those who felt that just wasn't a Motown sound,\" Moy says of the in-house response to the recording in 1967. The track sat on a shelf for two years before getting tacked on as B-side to the single \"I Don't Know Why.\"\n\n\"Some disc jockey turned (the record) over,\" she says. \"And then they started turning it over all over the world.\"\n\nFor his part, Wonder was ultimately OK with the delay: “It was wise for Motown to wait,” he told a Billboard seminar in 1977. “They felt the public wasn’t ready for that kind of Stevie Wonder sound.” LISTEN\n\n► \"My Cherie Amour\" is remembered by co-songwriter Sylvia Moy:\n\n29. \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch),\" Four Tops (1965)\n\nIn 1965, there weren't many musical powerhouses in the world hotter than Holland-Dozier-Holland, who brought the Four Tops the perfect pop-crossover springboard a year after \"Baby I Need Your Loving.\"\n\n\"Every time they did a production, they refined it more and more,\" says the Tops' Duke Fakir.\n\n\"Those three guys had great ears for what they were trying to do. It wasn’t like they were fishing around trying to find out what they wanted to do,\" he says. \"Even with our help, they knew exactly what they wanted: If we’d come up with a background, they’d say, ‘Yes, that it’s it. Let’s do it in this syncopation, blah blah blah.’ Same way with the lead singing with Levi (Stubbs).\"\n\n\"I Can't Help Myself\" was a switch-up for Stubbs, \"because it was totally a different kind of rhythm song,\" says Fakir. \"He was starting to get used to singing beautiful ballads and songs with other kinds of great melodies. … To get it in the right pocket, saying the right things with the right expressions at the right time — Eddie Holland was very good at teaching that and helping the singer promote the song in the way he heard it.\"\n\nBy the time the session was done, the Tops were confident they'd struck gold — and sure enough, the infectious \"I Can't Help Myself\" spent two weeks atop the pop chart while camping for nine weeks on the R&B side.\n\n\"We just had a feeling that one was the big one for real,\" says Fakir. \"And when it came out, it just exploded over the radio. I could hear it in the cars, I could hear it in the grocery stores. I’d be riding in my car and have my window down and hear it in someone else’s car. That one just truly, truly sent us to the moon mentally. We just felt like, ‘Wow, we’ve finally reached the real top.’” LISTEN\n\n► The Four Tops' Duke Fakir talks about \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" and working with Holland-Dozier-Holland:\n\n28. \"Lonely Teardrops,\" Jackie Wilson (1958)\n\nHaving landed on the map a year earlier with the zippy “Reet Petite,” Jackie Wilson applied his dynamic voice to another tune cowritten by the pre-Motown Berry Gordy, and propelled himself to the top of the charts.\n\n“Lonely Teardrops,” released on New York’s Brunswick label, showcased all the best qualities of Wilson’s singing: elastic, stylish, suave, mischievous, dramatic. It was classic ‘50s R&B injected with a distinct dose of Detroit soul, and became the single that sealed his stature as one of the era’s true superstars.\n\nOnstage, the song became a vehicle for Wilson’s sizzling theatrics, as he deployed some of the graceful moves learned in Detroit boxing gyms and dropped to his knees to electrify audiences. And during a New Jersey show 17 years later, \"Lonely Teardrops\" would become his unplanned swan song: As Wilson reached the climactic line “My heart is crying,\" he collapsed while suffering a heart attack — leading to a coma that would last until his 1984 death and subsequent interment in Detroit’s Westlawn Cemetery.\n\nWe’ve got a listenable Spotify link for you here, but to fully appreciate Mr. Excitement doing “Lonely Teardrops,” of course, it’s best to watch a performance from onstage.

Cranking up the tempo, lacing it with McCarty's wiry guitar work and Badanjek's rollicking fills, then stitching it together with Little Richard's \"Good Golly Miss Molly,\" the Detroit Wheels created the biggest success of their career.\n\nThe finished record features Ryder's initial vocal take, complete with his flubbed line \"bracelets on her fingers.\" It was \"my mistake,\" Ryder says, \"but Crewe wanted the energy from the performance and was willing to sacrifice the lyric.\"\n\n\"Devil\" benefited from a two-pronged promotional campaign, pushed to radio stations by both the band's Bell label and a Motown team eager to capitalize on Long's songwriting royalties, and the single crested to No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100. LISTEN\n\n► Mitch Ryder talks about turning Shorty Long's lost Detroit song \"Devil With a Blue Dress On\" into a national smash:\n\n26. \"School's Out,\" Alice Cooper (1972)\n\nWhile touring relentlessly in the wake of \"Love it to Death\" and \"Killers,\" Alice Cooper and his band had begun the migration from Pontiac to Los Angeles by the time of this Top 10 hit — released just in time for the end of the '72 school year.\n\nThe song's infectious shout-along chorus and spirit of adolescent freedom proved a seductive cocktail to a new generation of young rock fans, and became the trademark song for Cooper and company in the band's early years.\n\n\"It’s a classic rock song,\" Cooper says. \"First of all, it’s got a lot of Yardbirds in it. We were always the band that wanted to be the Yardbirds. So did Aerosmith and so did a lot of these other bands. That was our roots, that kind of rock 'n’ roll.\"\n\nAs with most of the band's signature work in those years, \"School's Out\" got its mojo from the band's unique creative chemistry with producer Bob Ezrin.\n\n\"Bob Ezrin was our George Martin,\" says Cooper. \"He was the one who took that song and shaped it into what it is. At the bottom of it, it’s almost ‘Bolero’ — duh, duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh. Every single kid, from every generation, totally related to ‘School’s Out.’ To this day, if you play it for a 10-year-old kid, he goes yeahhh!\" LISTEN\n\n► Hear Alice Cooper talk about \"School's Out\":\n\n25. \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" Diana Ross (1970)\n\nDiana Ross’ first No. 1 after leaving the Supremes was actually her second go at “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”: In 1968, she and the group had cut it as a duet with the Temptations, after the song became a hit for Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nBut this “Mountain” was an entirely different scale. Featuring a slow, dramatic build and Ross’s soft-focus vocals, the new version might as well have been an entirely different song.\n\nProducers Ashford & Simpson cut the instrumental foundation at Motown’s Studio A in Detroit, then finished it off at their New York home base, where “we did the sweetening — what we called the top stuff — with the strings and the horns and vocals,” says arranger Paul Riser.\n\n“It had a very orchestral flavor. I was just champing at the bit waiting to get to it and finish it up,” says Riser. “I always loved doing full orchestration, but very few songs demanded it. That one did.”\n\nNew York musicians were enlisted for the cause, Riser says — not members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra as often reported elsewhere.\n\n“New York had a different flavor, a different attitude,” says Riser. “Very Broadway-ish, very outgoing, and that’s what is captured on that song.”\n\nMotown chief Berry Gordy, unhappy with the long track and its delayed gratification, initially declined to issue it as a single. Only after American DJs began spinning it on their own did he commission a shorter edit for release on 45.\n\nIn September 1970, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” succeeded Edwin Starr’s “War” atop the Billboard Hot 100 — the third time one Motown single had bumped another from the top spot. And Diana Ross was now climbing the heights to solo superstardom. LISTEN\n\n24. \"Turn the Page,\" Bob Seger (1973)\n\nBy 1972, Bob Seger knew the road lifestyle as intimately as anyone, having logged countless miles trekking across the country as he steadily built an audience and sharpened his songwriting pen. In the annals of rock, “Turn the Page\" is perhaps the definitive reflection of life as a traveling musician, a glimpse of the decidedly unglamorous grind where respite comes just once a night under the stage lights.\n\nThe song’s original version was recorded in 1972 by Seger in Detroit and at Leon Russell’s Oklahoma studio, where Alto Reed crafted one of the most distinctive sax lines in rock history: It was a mournful opening wail coaxed out of Reed by road manager Tom Weschler, who encouraged the saxophonist to imagine a black-and-white scene in a rainy late-night alley. One of the song’s most memorable lyrics was prompted by a real-life encounter at an Iowa gas station, where a trucker had confronted Seger and his long-haired crew with the taunt, “Are you a woman or a man?”\n\nThough it was released on the following year’s “Back in ‘72” album, “Turn the Page” secured its iconic status only after its Cobo Hall performance was included on 1976’s “Live Bullet.” With Seger’s soulfully weary vocal and a tempo evoking the feel of the “long and lonesome highway,” the song became an enduring fan favorite — and was covered by Metallica two decades later to become a massive rock-radio hit. LISTEN\n\n23. \"96 Tears,\" Question Mark & the Mysterians (1966)\n\nIt was the organ riff that shook the airwaves in fall 1966, while giving the pop-music canon one of its most beloved doses of garage rock.\n\n“96 Tears” was literally a homemade effort, recorded at a house studio where the control board was wedged into a closet. The Mysterians, fronted by the sunglasses-clad Question Mark, were a group of teen Mexican-Americans enamored of the Rolling Stones and inspired by the Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun.”\n\nThe Bay City group was becoming a regular at Detroit teen dances and DJ events when keyboardist Frankie Rodriguez came up with the “96 Tears” riff, played on a primitive Vox organ.\n\n“It was just a portable cheap keyboard that came out, and it had this unique sound to it,” says guitarist Bobby Balderrama. “They call it a ‘cheesy organ sound’ now when you see it (as a setting) in a keyboard.”\n\nQuestion Mark had titled the new tune “Too Many Teardrops” when drummer Eddie Serrato piped up with a juvenile joke: “Why don’t we call it ’69 Tears’?”\n\n“I go, wow, that’s a catchy name, but the numbers — they ain’t going to work. The radio stations won’t play it,” Balderrama says. “At my age, I knew what that meant.”\n\nThe numbers were flipped around, the band had its song, and the resulting record began making its way across the state, landing Detroit airplay and a big break on Windsor’s influential CKLW. “96 Tears” was a long-established Michigan hit by the time it got picked up nationally by Cameo-Parkway and made its way to No. 1 in October ’66.\n\n“It was different. It was more raw-sounding,” says Balderrama. “It didn’t sound like it was done with a lot of production. And I think that’s why people loved that song.”\n\n“96 Tears” was the Mysterians' lone trip to the Top 10. But the band is proud of its place in rock's lineage.\n\n“People will look at us as the grandfathers of punk rock, you know?” says Balderrama. “And I take that as a great remark.” LISTEN\n\n► Hear Bobby Balderrama look back on \"96 Tears\" and the origins of Question Mark & the Mysterians:\n\n22. \"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\" the Stooges (1969)\n\nThe Stooges were still learning to play their instruments when they recorded their debut album in 1969, unleashing a primordial salvo that would eventually change the face of rock.\n\n\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" was defiantly simple, raw and self-aware — a sonic middle finger to a hippie-rock culture that had grown too big for its bell-bottoms, as far as Iggy Pop and company were concerned.\n\nThe song had been a fixture in the band's short live set at metro Detroit gigs, where the group attracted the eye of Elektra Records' Danny Fields, in town to consider the MC5. He snatched up both acts.\n\nNothing quite like \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" had been heard before, with Ron Asheton's crashing guitar intro giving way to a simmering, sleigh bell-laced growl. Likely a mutation of the blues classic \"Baby Please Don't Go,\" the song felt as dangerous as it did ragged.\n\nThe Stooges remained industry outcasts through the decades, and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" got a tepid response from the black-tie crowd at the band's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2010. But its influence was vital, part of a Stooges catalog that helped spawn punk and give fuel to the alternative rock revolution of the '90s. LISTEN\n\n21. \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,\" the Temptations (1972)\n\nFrom a spare, cool groove and two simple chords, Norman Whitfield built one of the 1970s' soul-funk masterpieces.\n\nThe unorthodox producer also knew how to get the right performance out of the signature group in his stable, the Temptations, psychologically toying with lead vocalist Dennis Edwards and his fellow singers to elicit something compelling.\n\n\"He would try and rub you the wrong way if he wanted to get something out of you,\" says Edwards. But in the end, with \"all these gyrations he would go through, the finished product was magic.\"\n\n\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone,\" with its tale of a good-for-nothing dad who \"died on the 3rd of September,\" was particularly uncomfortable for Edwards: His father was a minister who died on the 3rd of October, and Motown's publicity team wanted to \"make a big thing\" out of the loose connection.\n\n\"I'm trying to tell them, 'Yeah, the big thing is, I've got to explain this to my mom,'\" Edwards recounts. \"She had a fit about it.\"\n\nWith a full-length version that clocked in at 12 minutes and an edited single that ran for more than six, \"Papa\" was far longer than the typical songs that dominated the radio. But there was nothing stopping it: The single headed to the top of the pop charts and earned three Grammy trophies.\n\n\"We took a real chance on it,\" says Edwards. \"But we found out: If you have a quality record, they would play it.\" LISTEN\n\nThe Temptations' Dennis Edwards revisits \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\":\n\n20. \"The Tears of a Clown,\" Smokey Robinson & the Miracles (1970)\n\n\"The Tears of a Clown\" sat in the shadows for nearly four years before at last emerging to become the biggest global hit of the Miracles' career.\n\nStevie Wonder and Hank Cosby had written and cut the instrumental track in fall 1966, but Wonder — unsure where to take the song next — handed it off to Smokey Robinson during that year's Motown Christmas party at Berry Gordy's house. For Robinson, the track's merry piccolo motif and a playful bassoon from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's Charles Sirard conjured a distinct mood.\n\n\"That was like something of the circus to me,\" Robinson says. \"That was Barnum & Bailey. That was Ringling Brothers.\"\n\nStill, Robinson wasn't interested in a lively big-top theme: \"I wanted to write something that I thought would be heart-wrenching,\" he says.\n\nThe Miracles singer had long been fascinated by the tale of Pagliacci, subject of the 19th Century opera of the same name — a clown who spent his days entertaining crowds but who \"went back to his dressing room and was very sad because he didn't have that kind of love from a woman,\" Robinson says.\n\nHe'd even tapped Pagliacci for songwriting inspiration once before, deploying the laughter-sadness dichotomy in the lyrics of Carolyn Crawford's \"My Smile Is Just a Frown (Turned Upside Down)\" in 1964.\n\nWith Robinson's lyrics in place, the Miracles' vocals were added and the track was included on the group's 1967 \"Make It Happen\" album. But it wasn't until 1970, when a slightly remodeled version of the tune was featured on a U.K. release, that \"Tears of a Clown\" took off, spending seven weeks atop the British pop charts and becoming one of Motown's all-time biggest sellers. LISTEN\n\n► Hear Smokey Robinson talk about the origins of \"The Tears of a Clown\":\n\n19. \"War,\" Edwin Starr (1970)\n\nThe Temptations were the first to record the potent Vietnam protest anthem \"War,\" which was tucked onto the group's album \"Psychedelic Shack.\" But for Berry Gordy, aggressive images of undertakers and mothers' tears made an uncomfortable fit for one of his marquee groups, and he declined to issue it as a single.\n\nSo writer-producers Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong were paired with the rugged-voiced Edwin Starr, a Detroit soul singer who'd come into the Motown fold with the company's recent acquisition of the competing Golden World stable. Inside Motown, an operation wrestling with changing trends and the emergent counterculture, they added up to a team of musical mavericks.\n\n\"America was having a lot of problems overseas,\" says Strong. \"War was going on, and it was not making any sense to us. Norman said, 'What is it good for, Barrett?' I said, ‘Not a damned thing!’\"\n\nStarr's intense rendition of \"War,\" over a busy, funky Whitfield production, was cut at Hitsville in spring 1970 and scaled the pop-chart summit that summer, logging three weeks at No. 1.\n\n“We had no idea it was going to be as big as it was,\" says Strong. \"But he was such an electric singer. He brought it to life.”\n\nThe record earned Starr a Grammy nomination and sent him on a phase of protest music, including a Top Five R&B follow-up, \"Stop the War Now,\" before he split from Motown in 1973 and headed for England, where he continued a run of mid-level R&B hits.\n\n\"War\" had life in it yet: The song returned to the charts in 1986, this time at the hands of Bruce Springsteen, who issued it as the lead single from his first live album. LISTEN\n\n18. \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,\" Jackie Wilson (1967)\n\nIf Jackie Wilson's 1967 smash for Brunswick Records sounds like it belongs to Motown, there's a good reason.\n\n\"Higher and Higher,\" which gave Wilson his biggest hit in years, featured the surreptitious work of Motown's Funk Brothers, including lithe bass work from James Jamerson and double-time rhythm from drummer Pistol Allen, who trekked to Chicago's Columbia Studios to lay down the track for producer Carl Davis.\n\n\"I would pay them double scale in cash,\" Davis wrote in his 2009 autobiography, \"so they loved to engage in a little moonlighting for me.\"\n\nWilson cut his vocals at a New York studio — a one-take effort, the late Davis said — lending a supple urgency to a single that's pure gold: There's a transcendent, uplifting sound to match the song's lyrical theme, boosted by the bright backing vocals of Motown's Andantes.\n\n\"Higher and Higher\" would turn out to be Wilson's final appearance in the pop Top 10 in the U.S., although the song's enduring appeal gave it three trips to the British charts through the years, hitting in 1969, 1975 and 1987. A cover by pop-country singer Rita Coolidge hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977 — two years after the start of the coma that would eventually lead to Wilson's 1984 death. LISTEN\n\n17. \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine,\" Gladys Knight & the Pips (1967)\n\n16. \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine,\" Marvin Gaye (1968)\n\nIt's just happy coincidence that these two singles wound up side by side on this list when voting wrapped up, but it's also fitting: Their stories are intrinsically intertwined, each forever linked to the other.\n\n\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was the work of the budding team of Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, fleshing out an idea concocted at piano by Strong, who channeled the same Ray Charles spirit that had inspired his 1959 hit, \"Money (That's What I Want).\"\n\n\" 'Grapevine' was a song where I did the groove and the bass line,\" says Strong. \"I came up with the idea, and I was going to do it. That was going to be my second 'Money,' because it had the same style of groove. I wanted it for myself.\"\n\nInstead, the song was recorded by the Miracles in 1966, a version left unreleased at the time after a thumbs-down from Motown's quality-control team. Months later, Whitfield and Barrett hit the studio with Gaye, crafting a \"Grapevine\" that Whitfield would later call \"this mystical, magical thing out of nowhere.\" Again they were shot down, and Gaye's recording was shelved.\n\n\"They thought it was too bluesy,\" Strong says. \"They weren't into that stuff. They didn't really know anything about it.\"\n\nThe next try came with the newly signed Gladys Knight & the Pips. This time it was fashioned with a brisk, funky arrangement influenced by Aretha Franklin's success with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, an effort to out-\"Respect\" the Queen of Soul's big hit, as Whitfield would say. Now Berry Gordy gave the green light, and the heavily percussive track — which paired drummers Benny Benjamin and Uriel Jones — hit the streets in autumn 1967. The record promptly became the biggest yet for Knight and company, topping the R&B charts that December and crossing over to the pop airwaves.\n\nBut the bullheaded Whitfield and Strong weren't done. Still pestering Motown brass about their year-old Gaye version, they at last got a sympathetic ear from quality-control chief Billie Jean Brown, who convinced Gordy to include it on Gaye's 1968 album, \"In the Groove.\"\n\nNow the world could hear Whitfield and Strong's masterwork: Moody, airy and exotic, it was a string-swept piece threaded with the crisp buzz of a Wurlitzer organ and carried by the throb of Pistol Allen's tom-toms — all crowned by a singular vocal performance from Gaye, who owned the song's mood of romantic betrayal.\n\nIt clicked. Picked up for play by a Chicago DJ, Gaye's \"Grapevine\" quickly spread through the Midwest, spurring Motown to rush a single into stores in October 1968. By December it was the country's No. 1 song, holding down the spot for seven weeks to become the best-charting hit ever recorded in Motown's Detroit studio.

With sisters Erma and Carolyn Franklin backing her, Aretha dished up another work-of-art vocal performance, laced with harmony later dubbed in by Ellie Greenwich — who suggested the addition after hearing the track in the office of producer Jerry Wexler.\n\nEmbraced as an anthem by civil rights activists and Vietnam soldiers, “Chain of Fools” was locked in at No. 1 on the R&B charts when the City of Detroit declared “Aretha Franklin Day” on Feb. 16, 1968, as Martin Luther King Jr. presented the singer an award at Cobo Hall on behalf of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference. LISTEN\n\n14. \"Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours,\" Stevie Wonder (1970)\n\nOne of the most important aspects of \"Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours\" can be found on the record's label: \"Produced by Stevie Wonder.\"\n\nReleased less than a year ahead of his 21st birthday, this exuberant 1970 hit saw Wonder bristling with creative energy and assuming more control as he approached a crucial contract negotiation with Motown. Written during a series of sessions with Syreeta Wright (Wonder's soon-to-be-wife) and Lee Garrett (a fellow alum of Michigan School for the Blind), \"Signed Sealed Delivered\" was a big step for the fast-blossoming musician, who gave a songwriting credit to his mom, Lula Mae Hardaway. (Wonder says she came up with the song's title refrain; Garrett has claimed it as his creation.)\n\nThe record came at a time when Wonder was fixated on the sounds of Memphis and Stax Records, and \"Signed Sealed Delivered\" captures that vibe, packed with hot horn blasts, a stuttering guitar lick and a propulsive groove bested only by the gushing, breathless vocals that give the song its ecstatic punch. The recording captures a performance that sounds positively triumphant, and the reality of the matter was becoming clear to the world at large: Stevie Wonder was a talent to be reckoned with, stocked with a rich musical mother lode begging to be mined.\n\nThat's precisely what would happen in years to come. In retrospect, \"Signed Sealed Delivered\" was a key turning point in Wonder's career, finding him with one foot in the '60s and another in the decade that would see him become one of the most vital artists of the 20th Century. LISTEN\n\n13. \"Old Time Rock and Roll,\" Bob Seger (1978)\n\nDisco was in full flight, heavy metal was roaring to life and punk was biting at the edges when Bob Seger threw down the musical gauntlet.\n\nWith “Old Time Rock and Roll,” Seger pledged allegiance to tradition amid a fast-changing music scene, romping through a three-chord, piano-driven rocker that has become a cornerstone of his catalog and a keepsake of American culture. As a tribute to vintage blues and funky old soul, the song may have been out of step with the zeitgeist, but it was right in Seger's wheelhouse.\n\nPenned by R&B songwriters George Jackson and Thomas E. Jones III, the song was presented to Seger by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, the Alabama outfit backing him for much of the 1978 album “Stranger in Town.” (Seger has said he rewrote many of the lyrics but declined to take a composer’s credit, a decision he once called “the dumbest thing I ever did.”)\n\nReleased as the album’s fourth single, it became a minor hit in 1979 and was quickly adopted into Seger’s live set. But the song got its long-term destiny four years later, when it was tapped for use in Tom Cruise’s breakout film, “Risky Business.” The resulting scene — Cruise in his underwear, sliding and dancing and lip-syncing to “Old Time Rock and Roll” — gave the track new life and forever linked it with one of the most memorable, reenacted and parodied moments in Hollywood history.\n\nBy 1992, “Old Time Rock and Roll” was ranked the second most-played jukebox selection in history (behind Patsy Cline’s “Crazy”), and Seger was bestowed a Living Legend Award by the Amusement and Music Operators Association. WATCH\n\n12. \"What I Like About You,\" the Romantics (1980)\n\nBefore it became a ubiquitous anthem in sports stadiums, college parties and classic-rock playlists, “What I Like About You” was just another fleeting hit.\n\nWith their matching suits and a throwback sound that nodded to old British rock and upbeat garage-pop, the Romantics were generating plenty of industry buzz by the time of their 1979 debut album. The group had formed on Detroit’s east side two years earlier — a coming-together of drummer Jimmy Marinos, bassist Rich Cole and guitarists Wally Palmar and Mike Skill — and it didn’t take long to get grabbed up by Nemperor Records, a CBS subsidiary.\n\nThe resulting album, recorded in Miami with British producer Pete Solley, featured several strong contenders, drawn from a pool of tunes licked into shape during the Romantics' Detroit club shows and out-of-town gigs. But it was “What I Like About You” that turned out to be \"lightning in a bottle,\" says Palmar.\n\n“Everything just really clicked with that writing and the performance of that song. And we knew it as soon as we heard it coming back out of the speakers,\" he says. \"Sure, the other songs on the album were all our babies. We loved them all. But for some reason, this one, you heard it (and) it just stuck out.”\n\nWith a chiming guitar riff concocted by Skill and lead vocals from Marino, the song brought giddy handclaps and a recurring “hey!” chat inspired by the Yardbirds’ “Over Under Sideways Down.” It was three minutes of infectious power pop, and the song climbed to No. 49 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBut while its U.S. chart run may have been brief, \"What I Like About You\" didn't fade away. The single's European success spurred CBS to film a music video, shot at a West Coast soundcheck. And so when MTV debuted in the States the following year, hungry for content, the Romantics clip was called into service and the song got a second shot of life. The mainstream profile of “What I Like About You” was cemented for good when Budweiser secured the track for a TV ad campaign in 1989, and it went on to be one the most-licensed songs in recent decades, with covers including a 2014 rendition by the boy band 5 Seconds of Summer. LISTEN\n\n► Wally Palmar looks back on \"What I Like About You\":\n\n11. \"Stop! In the Name of Love,\" the Supremes (1965)\n\nWith a Hammond organ coolly sliding into a blast of bold vocals, “Stop! In the Name of Love” doesn’t wait around to make its declaration: You're getting a new class of Supremes song.\n\nLighter fare like “Baby Love” and “Where Did Our Love Go” had carried the Motown trio to pop music’s front row in 1964. But the group remained restless, says Mary Wilson, aware that the Supremes were regarded as less edgy than counterparts such as the Marvelettes and Martha and the Vandellas.\n\n\"Those songs were some of the ones that we weren’t that crazy about,\" says Wilson. And so this latest Holland-Dozier-Holland piece, cut in early 1965, marked a welcome shift.\n\n“By the time we recorded ‘Stop,’ we were actually really getting into the material that H-D-H was sending us,” says Wilson. “As a group, we had in our mind that we wanted to go in other directions, in terms of the style, the genre. We wanted to be a little more R&B.”\n\nThe song also returned Wilson, Diana Ross and Flo Ballard to the kind of approach they’d honed as the pre-Motown Primettes.\n\n“That was definitely good, because we loved singing harmony and singing together,” says Wilson. \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" was \"more of a group sound out of the gate.”\n\nDespite the Supremes’ success to that point, Wilson says, each new recording felt like a roll of the dice, a hope that the hot streak could continue. For now, the prevailing mood “was just this happiness of being in the middle of the party.”\n\nThe single made its mark on the charts that spring, becoming the group’s fourth straight chart-topper. But true posterity for \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" was forged onstage, where the Supremes’ stylish, synchronized routine — arms out, palms up — became one of the iconic images in popular culture.\n\n“Even now — and I’m sure Diane has the same thing happen to her — whenever I sing that song, everyone knows it. They even do ... a couple of little movements that we didn’t really do. I’m looking back, like, did we do that?!” Wilson says with a laugh. “It definitely has defined not only that song, but the choreography of that decade.” LISTEN\n\n► The Supremes' Mary Wilson talks about the recording and choreography of \"Stop! In the Name of Love\":\n\n10. “Lose Yourself,” Eminem (2002)\n\nLong before it had lyrics or a name, the preeminent song of Eminem’s career was just another anonymous beat in an ever-growing stack of studio experiments.\n\nWith guitar, bass and piano by longtime collaborator Jeff Bass and drums programmed by DJ Head, the instrumental track was compelling but left unused.\n\n“We kept pulling it in and out over the years,” says Bass. “We knew something was really amazing about it, but we didn’t know what it was.”\n\nThen came “8 Mile,” the 2002 film starring Eminem and loosely based on his life. Charged by director Curtis Hanson to write a song capturing the experience of his B-Rabbit character, Eminem pulled out the old Jeff Bass track and went to work.\n\nIt still needed tinkering: Engineer Steve King dug in to pinpoint the right stretch of taut guitar to loop throughout the song, while a blast of guitars in the chorus was deemed “too rocky” and got replaced by Luis Resto’s dramatic keyboards. Bass’s piano intro was sprinkled with crackle to give it the feel of an old record sample.\n\nRecording lyrics in a mobile studio on the movie's Detroit set, mining his own tale for inspiration and stitching together a few lines at a time, Eminem constructed his anthemic masterpiece.\n\nThe result was a command performance, one of the most gripping in hip-hop history — a breathless, intense, motivational execution that solidified his stature as one of the genre’s greats.\n\n“That build in the third verse is insane,” says Bass. “It was pure genius. On every emotional level, he brought that song.”\n\nReaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 2002, “Lose Yourself” stayed there for 12 weeks — the most successful hit ever to come out of Michigan. A few months later, it took the Academy Award for best original song.\n\n“When it comes on the radio today, I still get goosebumps,” says Bass. “It’s really what music is supposed to be. … Every musician out there knows what that song does emotionally to the human soul. It moves it, one way or the other.” LISTEN\n\n► The making of \"Lose Yourself\" as told by producer-songwriter Jeff Bass:\n\n9. “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell (1967)\n\nNickolas Ashford had just moved from Ypsilanti to New York, ready for the challenge of his new surroundings. As songwriting partner Valerie Simpson tells it, Ashford was walking through Central Park West when the city’s range of skyscrapers struck him as mountains to be conquered.\n\n“He said to himself, ‘These mountains are not going to stop me. I’m going to make it in New York,’” Simpson says of her late husband. “That really was the inspiration for the song.”\n\nAshford & Simpson were aiming to get a foot in the door at Motown Records when they turned that aspirational insight into a powerful love song for the ages, shipping their demo to the production team of Johnny Bristol and Harvey Fuqua back in Detroit.\n\nThat was all the convincing Motown needed: The song became the first for the newly paired Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and although their parts were recorded separately at Hitsville’s Studio A, the harmonized chemistry was instantly obvious. “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” kicked off a run that made Gaye and Terrell one of the decade’s leading duos, thanks in part to Gaye’s knack for being “such an accommodating singer,” in Simpson's words.\n\n“Singers usually are a little bit more selfish, and he just wasn’t. He was always coming up with the ad lib that would make you shine, make you sound better, pushing you forward. He was challenging,” says Simpson. “But she was very cocky as well because she was the newcomer, and so they really challenged each other. I think that’s what made them so good together.”\n\n“Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” was recast in 1970 for Diana Ross — it’s at No. 25 on this list — and the two versions helped it become Ashford & Simpson’s loftiest work.\n\nThe song has endured, Simpson says, because of its motivational message: “I’m going to make it, I’m going to overcome, I can’t be stopped.”\n\n“I think people feel that, even more than they feel like it’s just a love song between two people,” she says. “Because that’s what it was born out of.” LISTEN\n\n► Hear Valerie Simpson look back on \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\":\n\n8. “Night Moves,” Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band (1976)\n\nAfter years of toughing it out on the road, Bob Seger had finally cleared the big hurdle. “Live Bullet,” cut at Cobo Arena in September 1975, had given him a national name, and now came the critical test: a chance to lock in the momentum for good.\n\nThat feat would come with “Night Moves,” a nostalgic, poignant look at bygone adolescent days, steeped in imagery from Seger’s Michigan youth — 1960 Chevys, drive-in theaters, fumbling teenage hook-ups happening “out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy.” It was raw Midwestern poetry, and tapped what would become a familiar Seger theme, reckoning with the reality of age as time marched on.\n\n“Night Moves” is a tapestry of musical colors, building from acoustic guitar into a purposeful tempo and a metaphorically fitting climax before settling down to rebuild again. Seger had wrestled for months with the arrangement, unsure how to link up the final parts, until Bruce Springsteen’s cleverly structured “Jungleland” pointed the way.\n\nCut in Toronto with producer Jack Richardson, the recording features just two Silver Bullet members — drummer Charlie Martin and bassist Chris Campbell — with session players rounding out the ensemble. (The final note of a scrapped Paul Cotton guitar solo can be heard in the crescendo just before the song’s slow section.)\n\nThe finished version showcases the elements that would come to be Seger hallmarks: soulful female backing, rolling piano and organ, and a vocal performance that’s both reflective and thunderous.\n\n“Night Moves” became the title track on his next LP for Capitol Records, an album that went on to sell more than six million copies. The song itself peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in spring 1977, first in a slew of Top 10 Seger hits as the long-loved Detroit rocker secured his place as the voice of the American heartland. LISTEN\n\n7. “The Tracks of My Tears,” the Miracles (1965)\n\nSmokey Robinson was stuck.\n\nFor a couple of weeks, he’d been fixated on a reel-to-reel demo tape provided by Marv Tarplin — a captivating guitar riff that just needed the right words to go with it.\n\nRobinson had crafted the heart of a chorus, but was struggling to nail down a satisfying final line: “Take a good look at my face / You’ll see my smile looks out of place / If you look closer it’s easy to trace … that somebody else is loving you.”\n\n“I went through a thousand of those, man,” Robinson says with a laugh.\n\nInspiration finally struck, as if often does, in the unlikeliest of moments. Standing at the mirror for a morning shave, Robinson had an epiphany.\n\n“I was looking at myself and I was thinking: What if there was a person that cried so much until you could see tracks that the tears had made in their face?” he recounts. “And I said, ‘That’s it!’ So the rest of the song came after that.”\n\n“The Tracks of My Tears,” recorded by Robinson and the Miracles in spring 1965, was gorgeously aching and achingly gorgeous — an exquisite expression of heartbreak rendered in silk by Robinson over his group's suave backing.\n\nAlthough it stalled at No. 16 on the pop charts, the song proved deep and lasting, covered through the decades by artists as eclectic as Aretha Franklin, Billy Bragg and Linda Ronstadt, who took it to the pop and country airwaves in 1975. The Who’s 1966 hit “Substitute” grew from Pete Townshend’s enchantment with Robinson’s phrasing on the line “Although she may be cute / She’s just a substitute.”\n\n“The Tracks of My Tears” was another plank in Robinson’s growing reputation as the poet laureate of popular music, and it continues to be regarded among his finest achievements. The Library of Congress inducted the Miracles’ version into the National Recording Registry in 2008, and the song leads a body of work that has earned Robinson the prestigious Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, which he’ll receive in November. LISTEN\n\n► Smokey Robinson looks back on the writing of \"The Tracks of My Tears\":\n\n6. “Seven Nation Army,” the White Stripes (2003)\n\nIf anyone showed how much musical force could be generated by two humans, it was the White Stripes. And if any song drove home that truth, it was “Seven Nation Army.”\n\nWritten and recorded for the band’s 2003 album, “Elephant,” the track was a powerful and magnetic piece punctuated by Jack White’s gloriously gnarled slide-guitar lick — very likely this century’s best-known rock riff.\n\n“The melody for the song was written at a sound check for a show in Australia at a club called the Corner Hotel in Melbourne,” White says by e-mail. “I played the riff over and over in front of Meg White and our friend Ben Swank. I seemed to be the only person who thought it was interesting at the time, but it grew on my musician friends eventually!”\n\nIn his notes, Jack White logged it as “Bond Theme,\" figuring he’d save it for a James Bond soundtrack if opportunity called. Reminded by his sister Maureen of his fumbling boyhood pronunciation of \"the Salvation Army,\" White crossed that out and wrote down “the seven nation army” as “a way to inspire myself lyrically.”\n\n“Ironically it was my brother Joe and his wife Robin who were working at the St. Vincent de Paul thrift store in southwest Detroit that gave me the Kay guitar I performed the song on,” White says. It was payment for helping move a fridge.\n\n(Five years later, he did get a shot at a Bond theme, cutting “Another Way to Die” with Alicia Keys.)\n\nThe song’s story presents a character frustrated by local gossip, splitting town to head to Wichita. In fact, says White, the Kansas town is “a place I’ve still never been, and out of respect for using the city as a metaphor, and due to the song’s longevity now, I will never go to.”\n\n“Seven Nation Army” has taken on a life far beyond the White Stripes: Starting with European soccer fans in the mid-2000s, White’s melodic hook has become a fixture in global sports stadiums and other gatherings, gustily and often spontaneously chanted by tens of thousands. Many have no clue about the melody’s origin.\n\n“That inspires me greatly and makes me feel proud that I was a conduit and antenna at one moment in time for other people to help express themselves,” says White. “The less people know where it came from, the more it is ingrained in the tradition of folk music, and the more it feels anonymous to the public, the more I’m fulfilled as a songwriter.” LISTEN\n\n► Jack White reflects on \"Seven Nation Army\" in an email interview here.\n\n5. “Kick out the Jams,” MC5 (1969)\n\nEverything was on the line when the MC5 stepped into the Grande Ballroom on Oct. 30, 1968.\n\nThe seasoned Detroit band had signed with Elektra Records and — in a typically revolutionary gesture — had decided to produce a live album for its debut. A recording truck was rolled into the alley, the band gathered backstage, and the tension ramped up.\n\n“It was the most pressure I’d ever experienced playing,” says guitarist Wayne Kramer.\n\nWhat followed was an explosive, muscular monument to Detroit rock, reprised the next night for a second round of recording at the Grande.\n\nThe resulting album, “Kick out the Jams,” took its name from the set’s standout number, a song written at the MC5 commune on Forest Avenue, a time “when we were really starting to feel like we could say something,” as Kramer says. Rob Tyner’s emphatic cry — “Let me be who I am!” — caps a primal salvo of high-energy music, as the band called its work.\n\nFurious and chaotic, “Kick out the Jams” was unlike anything else sitting in the record stores of the day, and the song gave the Motor City an indelible rock identity.\n\n“The recording captures unrestrained enthusiasm of not only the five band members but of the whole Detroit community, because that’s them screaming in the background,” says Kramer. The song invited “this sense of possibilities — that there could be a new sound and a new politics and a new lifestyle.”\n\nIt was also turned out too provocative for the band’s own good. Tyner’s shouted introduction, “Kick out the jams, mother (expletive),” became a headache for all involved, causing the record to be banned by the Hudson’s chain and spurring an internal battle that led Elektra to drop the group.\n\nFor years, Kramer was uneasy about the “Kick out the Jams” that had been captured on record. The band was capable of far better, he was convinced, and he was frustrated in particular with his performance, including a guitar that had slipped out of tune.\n\nKramer has come around.\n\n“I hear it now for the high-energy, unrestrained, youthful message that it carries,” he says. “It stands on its own as a pretty intense record.” LISTEN\n\n► Wayne Kramer reflects on \"Kick Out the Jams\":\n\n4. “My Girl,” the Temptations (1964)\n\nOn Dec. 21, 1964, the winter solstice brought one of the warmest, sunniest Motown hits ever put to vinyl.\n\nEverything came together with “My Girl,” from James Jamerson’s hypnotic opening bass to Robert White’s stair-stepping guitar line to David Ruffin’s muscular, aggressive voice finessed into something affectionate and approachable. In the year of the British rock invasion, you weren’t apt to hear many orchestral solos on the airwaves, but Motown was happy to provide one, enlisting the Detroit Symphony Orchestra’s strings for the song’s lush break.\n\nThere are those irresistible, colorful couplets, the handiwork of songwriter Smokey Robinson — “so much honey / the bees envy me,” “a sweeter song / than the birds in the trees.” As a playfully devised counterpart to “My Guy,” his smash for Mary Wells earlier that year, “My Girl” found Robinson in a rhyming, chiming, metaphor-happy zone.\n\nAfter several years of false starts, the Temptations had finally gotten on the map months earlier with “The Way You Do the Things You Do,” featuring tenor Eddie Kendricks on lead. He and Paul Williams had been the go-to front men for producers working with the group, but Robinson had a different idea as he approached the Tempts with his new composition.\n\n“I knew if I could get David Ruffin to sing something sweet, it would be a hit,” Robinson says.\n\nHis instincts were on target: Released Christmas week, “My Girl” was the country’s No. 1 song by March, and the Temptations were on the way to becoming the biggest male R&B group of the decade. Ruffin was key to that success for several years, lending lead vocals to hits such as “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,” “Beauty Is Only Skin Deep” and “I Wish It Would Rain.”\n\nFor Robinson, the song has “become my international anthem as a songwriter,” he says, and it remains a centerpiece of his solo concerts. LISTEN\n\n► \"My Girl\" is revisited by Smokey Robinson:\n\n3. “Dancing in the Street,” Martha and the Vandellas (1964)\n\n“Every time I hear those trumpets, I get up. I have to move,” says Martha Reeves. “So I know how it affects other people.”\n\nThe effusive opening stretch of “Dancing in the Street,” perhaps the most exhilarating start to any of Motown’s big hits, was certainly designed to get folks moving. With callouts to locales across the country — Chicago, New Orleans, a can’t-be-forgotten Motor City — the song’s \"invitation across the nation\" proved irresistible in summer 1964.\n\nReeves wasn’t the first singer tapped for the track. Written by Mickey Stevenson, Ivy Joe Hunter and Marvin Gaye, “Dancing in the Street” was initially slated for Gaye. But his romantic-crooner approach didn’t sit right with producers eager for a high-energy track. And Reeves, whose big and brassy vocals had propelled hits such as “(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave,” was a logical choice.\n\nHer vocal session at Studio A has since become the stuff of Hitsville lore. Giving it her all on a first go, Reeves was distraught when engineer Lawrence Horn told her the tape hadn’t been running.\n\n“I don’t know if it was a producer’s trick or if it was genuine,” she says. “But I got a little upset: ‘You didn’t have the machine on?!’“\n\nThat brought a second take fueled by vim and vigor.\n\n“That’s why it sounds so live,” Reeves says. “The energy is at the top of my spirit, because I had to do it again.”\n\n“Dancing in the Street” was distinct from Motown’s output to that point. With its universal slant, the song was a downright anthem, and was embraced by civil rights activists who had their own idea of calling out around the world for a brand new beat.\n\nFor Reeves, though, the inspiration was purely local. While prepping for the song, she thought back to the lively summer evenings of her youth near the corner of Riopelle and Leland, where the City of Detroit had closed the street to vehicle traffic after a pedestrian accident.\n\n“It was like a street dance you could never forget,” she says. “From maybe 7 o’clock till the sun went down or the street lights came on, we would party in the street. So I remembered that.”\n\nReleased in July 1964, “Dancing in the Street” remains one of the quintessential summer songs, and covers by acts such as Van Halen and Mick Jagger-David Bowie have made their own marks since. LISTEN\n\n► Hear Martha Reeves look back on \"Dancing in the Street\":\n\n2. “What’s Going On,” Marvin Gaye (1971)\n\nThe dawn of the 1970s was an uneasy period for Marvin Gaye. The death of singing partner Tammi Terrell had shaken him up, letters from a brother in Vietnam had unnerved him, and the aftermath of Detroit’s riots brought a pensive mood.\n\nThus was born an epic Gaye work that proved timely and timeless, an urgent social commentary with the pleading refrain: “You know we've got to find a way / To bring some lovin' here today.”\n\nThe Four Tops’ Obie Benson had brought the song to Gaye, who augmented the lyrics and set about to it record it for the Originals in his budding producer role. By the time he oversaw the instrumental track, Gaye had decided to keep it for himself.\n\nFor all of the intensity in the song’s message, Gaye’s velvety performance is subtle and serene, the sound of a singer confidently riding his instincts. Gaye wasn’t shoving anything into his listeners’ faces; he was leading them by the hand.\n\nThat welcoming vibe is signaled from the song's start, where the chattering sounds of a party (featuring Detroit Lions players like Mel Farr) give way to Eli Fontaine’s cool, noodling sax.\n\n“What’s Going On” also ushered in a trademark Gaye studio technique, thanks to a fluke: Picky about his singing, often recording phrase by phrase, he wanted to compare two vocal takes to make a choice. So engineer Ken Sands cut a mix with one on the left channel and the other on the right. Fascinated by the dual voices, Gaye opted to keep both, and multiple layered vocals became part of his work going forward.\n\nThe completed track was resisted by Motown chief Berry Gordy — less because of its lyrical content than its sound, far removed from Gaye’s signature romantic fare.\n\n“Berry actually thought it was a cool record. He just couldn’t see Marvin restarting his career,” says Bob Olhsson, one of several engineers on the project. “If anything, Berry was hesitant about it because he was such a jazz lover. It’s almost like, if he liked something too much, he was afraid of it from a commercial point of view.”\n\nAt the urging of other Motown execs, “What’s Going On” was pressed in a small run. The reaction from radio stations and record stores was fast and overwhelming, and a wider release was rushed out.\n\n“Within a week or two, it’s in the top five, and we get this phone call: ‘Where’s the album?!’” says Olhsson. “Well, the album hadn’t even been written, much less recorded. And then it turned into all hands on deck.”\n\nA month of frantic work ensued, with sessions at both of Motown’s Detroit studios. By spring, the “What’s Going On” album was on its way to record racks — and to a pedestal among the all-time greats.\n\n“Marvin himself said that God produced the album,” says Olhsson. “And that’s totally the case.” LISTEN\n\n► \"What's Going On\" is remembered by engineer Bob Olhsson:\n\n1. “Respect,” Aretha Franklin (1967)\n\nIt was the song that turned a young Detroit singer into musical royalty.\n\nAretha Franklin was already a known force by summer 1967, having joined Atlantic Records after a Columbia run. But it was “Respect” that took her to the stratosphere, becoming her first No. 1 hit and an inseparable part of her identity.\n\nRecorded on Valentine’s Day 1967 at Atlantic’s New York studios, “Respect” found the 22-year-old singer sinking her teeth into Otis Redding’s frustrated plea for domestic order. Aretha didn’t just flip Redding’s song on its head — she remolded it, fortified it and made it fully her own.\n\nFranklin’s rendition brings a proud, deal-with-it tone over saucy backing from sisters Carolyn and Erma. It was bold and authoritative — the sound of empowerment put to wax — and by the time it was done, soul music had a new queen.\n\nCornell Dupree’s pointed, twangy guitar lick kicks off a track pushed forward by Aretha’s bounding gospel piano and the loose swagger of a band that included Tommy Cogbill on bass, Spooner Oldham on organ and Gene Chrisman on drums. The song’s distinctive sax solo features King Curtis on lead accompanied by Charlie Chalmers and Willie Bridges.\n\n“R-E-S-P-E-C-T” may be one of the most famous hooks in the history of popular music, but it appears at just one point in the song, repeated in a break as the song heads into its homestretch.\n\nThe song gave mainstream American culture an injection of black slang — “propers” (eventually to become “props”) and “TCB” (taking care of business) — while further popularizing “sock it to me,” which had also appeared a year earlier in Mitch Ryder’s Detroit rocker “Devil with a Blue Dress On.”\n\nIndeed, “Respect” itself had already been given a Detroit stamp, becoming a regional hit with the Rationals’ uptempo soul-rock version in 1966.\n\nBut nobody could ratify the song like Aretha, whose gospel-honed vocals and self-assured delivery drove the song to a different place. Today her performance stands not just as a musical triumph, but a social milestone — a barrier-breaking rallying cry that took the song beyond household affairs and into the realm of feminism and civil rights.\n\nFranklin reflected on the song in “From These Roots,” her 1999 autobiography with David Ritz:\n\n“So many people identified with and related to ‘Respect.’ It was the need of a nation, the need of the average man and woman on the street, the businessman, the mother, the fireman, the teacher — everyone wanted respect. It was one of the battle cries of the civil rights movement. The song took on monumental significance.” LISTEN\n\nContact Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/04/12/live-music-austin-concerts-shows-spring-summer-2022-texas-guide-calendar-tickets-dates/9515145002/", "title": "Live music in Austin: Guide to concerts for spring and summer 2022", "text": "Spring is here, and summer is coming.

After gradually building a sizable audience with six albums from 1999 to 2011, My Morning Jacket noticeably slowed down over the past decade, releasing just 2015’s acclaimed “The Waterfall” plus a subsequent set of “Waterfall” outtakes in 2020. It wasn’t necessarily clear the Kentucky band would continue, especially since leader Jim James issued several solo albums during that stretch. But MMJ returned last fall with a self-titled album that re-established the band’s reputation for merging indie-rock with psych-tinged folk and country. Opening act Madison Cunningham, a Southern California singer-songwriter, earned a Grammy nomination for her latest release. $38-$202. 7 p.m. waterloogreenway.org. — P.B.\n\nMack, Jack & McConaughey presents Jack Ingram with Morgan Wade, Rodney Crowell, Lori McKenna, more at ACL Live\n\nAJR, Gayle at Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nModest Mouse, Cribs at Luck TX\n\nBuilt to Spill at Mohawk\n\nSteve Forbert at 04 Center\n\nPenny & Sparrow at Paramount Theatre\n\nPup at Stubb’s\n\nMenzingers, Oso Oso, Sincere Engineer at Empire Garage\n\nHomeshake at Hotel Vegas\n\nJan Blomqvist at Concourse Project\n\nMartin Zellar at 3Ten\n\nApril 29-30\n\nGeorge Strait, Willie Nelson, Randy Rogers Band at Moody Center. Though the new UT-campus arena’s first shows are April 20-21 with John Mayer, this Texas-themed triple bill is billed as the Moody Center’s official grand opening bash. It’s also a two-day 89th birthday party for Willie, which is fitting given that he was born just before midnight on April 29, 1933, but his birthday was recorded on his birth certificate as April 30. It’s a rare treat to have Nelson and Poteet native Strait, who’s had more chart-topping country hits than any other artist, on the same bill. (King George will turn 70 in May.) Opening both nights is the San Marcos-based Randy Rogers Band. This show ain’t cheap; upper-level tickets start at $375, with stage-side seats going as high as $3,000. 7:30 p.m. moodycenteratx.com. — P.B.\n\nApril 30\n\nChristone “Kingfish” Ingram at ACL Live. The 23-year-old blues guitarist shaped his sound at the Delta Blues Museum in hometown Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he took guitar lessons as a child. With a deep voice, an intuitive approach to phrasing and a knack for coaxing emotion from his six-string, he has become one of the leading voices in the new generation of blues players. Earlier this month, Ingram won his first Grammy, taking home the contemporary blues album award for his 2021 release, “662.” Maggie Rose opens. $25-$45. 7:30 p.m. acl-live.com — D.S.S.\n\nNathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats at Waterloo Park\n\nHot Chip at Stubb’s\n\nMike Campbell & the Dirty Knobs at Antone’s (sold out)\n\nRole Model at Scoot Inn\n\nWailers at Haute Spot\n\nTalbott Brothers at 3Ten\n\nDance With the Dead, Magic Sword at Empire Garage\n\nJeremy Olander, Cristoph at Concourse Project\n\nTrout Fishing in America at 04 Center\n\nMay 1\n\nWillie Nelson Birthday Tribute at Luck TX. If those Strait/Nelson shows at the Moody Center are too rich for your blood, this Sunday show at Nelson’s ranch west of Austin is a more than worthy alternative for celebrating the Red Headed Stranger’s birthday. Co-presented by Luck and Bruce Robison’s venture Next Waltz, the concert will feature an appearance by Willie himself plus sets from Nashville’s Margo Price, Colorado’s Nathaniel Rateliff and three-named Texans Robert Earl Keen, Ray Wylie Hubbard and Vincent Neil Emerson. $35-$150. 7 p.m. luckpresents.com. — P.B.\n\nSnow tha Product at Emo’s. Raised by undocumented immigrants in California, the artist born Claudia Alexandra Feliciano has spent a decade steadily rising through the ranks to become the head chingona in charge of the Latinx hip-hop underground. Rapping in English and Spanish, she slips hard topics like immigration and social justice into rowdy, ratchet rap shows. $27. 7 p.m. emosaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nTori Amos at ACL Live\n\nMore Austin music: For third show in two years, Diana Ross comes out to Austin and shouts out to teen fan\n\nMay 2\n\nSnail Mail at ACL Live\n\nHenry Rollins at Paramount Theatre\n\nMay 3\n\nThe Who at Moody Center. Roger Daltrey is 78 and Pete Townshend is 76, so hopes to die before they got old didn’t pan out. Still, if you went to see The Who at the Erwin Center in 2015, you know that these Rock and Roll Hall of Famers still have a lot left in the tank. The touring lineup includes Pete’s brother, Simon Townshend, on guitar and drummer Zak Starkey, son of Ringo Starr. Expect strings, too: The Moody Center site notes that the tour stops will feature “some of the finest orchestras in the U.S. and Canada.” $41-$302. 7:30 p.m. moodycenteratx.com. — P.B.\n\nRosanne Cash at Paramount Theatre. Being Johnny Cash’s daughter may have helped in terms of name recognition, but it was clear that Rosanne had the goods as a singer-songwriter from the moment her breakthrough single, “Seven Year Ache,” hit the airwaves in 1981. Across four-plus decades, she’s released 14 albums and won four Grammys, winning wide acclaim for her incisive songwriting set to richly melodic acoustic-based arrangements. Tickets for the originally scheduled Feb. 15 show will be honored. $30-$75. 8 p.m. austintheatre.org. — P.B.\n\nOrville Peck at Stubb’s\n\nJuan Wauters at Mohawk indoor\n\nCimafunk “Austin City Limits” taping at ACL Live\n\nMay 4\n\nHAIM at Waterloo Park. Sisters Alana, Danielle and Este formed the band that carries their surname in California in 2007. During the South by Southwest Music Festival in 2012, their career began to pick up steam, as the alt-rock trio piqued the interest of industry insiders and tastemakers. The following year, they won the inaugural Grulke Prize for developing U.S. act. Now, with three albums, a slew of hit singles and a movie (“Licorice Pizza”) under their belts, they return to remind us that family ties can create powerful rock synergy on one of Austin’s biggest stages.

Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia met at Bamako’s Institute for the Young Blind in the 1970s. Originally marketed as “the blind couple of Mali” in West Africa, they came to prominence in Europe in the early 2000s after scoring a hit on French radio. Subsequent tours with the likes of Coldplay and U2 made them one of Mali’s biggest exports. The original members of the Blind Boys of Alabama, including current bandleader Jimmy Carter, met as children at the Alabama Institute for the Negro Blind in the late 1930s. Winning popularity with their tight-laced gospel harmonies toured through the segregated South during the Jim Crow era, they would later help soundtrack the Civil Rights movement. In recent years, the group has collaborated with Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), Taj Mahal and Valerie June. This show brings the two groups together for a lively cross-cultural outing. $35-$60. 8 p.m. austintheatre.org. — D.S.S.\n\nIndigo Girls at Stubb’s\n\nMadeinTYO, UnoTheActivist, more at Empire Garage\n\nLast Bandoleros, Lisa Morales, Nuevo at 04 Center\n\nMay 6\n\nRobert Earl Keen at Round Rock Amp. He’s retiring from the road (what, it doesn’t actually go on forever?) later this year, so catch Keen while you can. He’s a true Texas troubadour, one of the state’s top draws among Americana artists for several decades. This is also a good chance to see the northern suburb’s new outdoor amphitheater, run by the folks who operated the now-shuttered Nutty Brown Cafe southwest of town. 6 p.m. $45-$200. roundrockamp.com. — P.B.\n\nKurt Vile & the Violators, Chastity Belt at ACL Live\n\nJosh Rouse, Vetiver at 04 Center\n\nTurnstile at Stubb’s (sold out)\n\nNew York BeeGees at Paramount Theatre\n\nMndsgn at Empire Control Room\n\nMay 6-7\n\nAvett Brothers at Whitewater Amphitheater\n\nMore Austin music: With Wisconsin witchcraft, Bon Iver keeps us from a lonely dark\n\nMay 7\n\nPatti Smith at ACL Live. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Smith, now 75, occupies a singular place in American music. From the influential 1975 proto-punk album “Horses” to her 1978 hit single “Because the Night” to her 1988 anthem “People Have the Power” to her 2010 National Book Award-winning memoir “Just Kids,” she’s consistently transcended boundaries with works of passion and compassion. $40-$100. 8 p.m. acl-live.com. — P.B.\n\nBAKAR at Scoot Inn\n\nTyphoon at Empire Garage\n\nColin Hay at Paramount Theatre\n\nOkilly Dokilly, Steaksauce Mustache at Empire Control Room\n\nMax Frost at 3Ten\n\nJohn Doe Trio at Stateside at the Paramount\n\nMay 7-8\n\nPatty Griffin, John Fullbright at Gruene Hall. Austin singer-songwriter Griffin’s latest release, a self-titled album from 2019, won the Maine transplant her second Grammy Award. Joining her is Oklahoma troubadour Fullbright, whose long-awaited follow-up to his 2014 sophomore album “Songs” is tentatively due out later this year. $59.50. 8 p.m. May 7, 7 p.m. May 8. gruenehall.com. — P.B.\n\nBikini Kill at Far Out Lounge, Mohawk (both shows sold out)\n\nStick Figure at Stubb’s (night one sold out)\n\nMay 8\n\nBen DeLaCreme at Emo’s. Any reservations we might have had about including drag queens in our regular music listings were laid to rest when “RuPaul's Drag Race” star Trixie Mattel drew a huge crowd at Austin City Limits Music Festival for her sparkling set of ballads, pop ditties and costume reveals. Trixie’s castmate, Ben DeLaCreme, won more challenges than any contestant in “Drag Race” history when the two shared the screen on the third season of the reality franchise's “All-Stars” spin-off. Self-described as “terminally delightful,” Season 6’s Miss Congeniality bolsters her vaudevillian sensibility with serious vocal chops. Her new, marriage-themed show combines original songs, comedy and burlesque. $45-$55. 7 p.m. emosaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nClinton Kane at Antone’s\n\nErin Rae at 3Ten\n\nBritish Invasion Live on Stage at ACL Live\n\nKelsy Karter at Mohawk indoor\n\nMay 9\n\nSylvan Esso \"Austin City Limits\" taping at ACL Live\n\nCovet at Antone’s\n\nMay 11\n\nDave Matthews Band at Moody Center. It’s a new venue for one of America’s top-drawing musical acts, after three stops in the past decade at Circuit of the Americas’ outdoor amphitheater. Expect the same blend of multiple genres into an organic sound that has put the DMB at the top of the jam-band circuit since they arose from Virginia in the 1990s. $95-$1,176. 7:30 p.m. moodycenteratx.com. — P.B.\n\nKing Hannah at Mohawk indoor\n\nDarius, Cezaire at Parish\n\nMay 12\n\nAngélique Kidjo at Bass Concert Hall. On her 2021 album “Mother Nature,” the 61-year-old Beninese Afropop artist delivers sharp observations about the climate crisis and global injustice with her forceful voice and wraps her sweeping calls for pan-African unity in jubilant rhythm and harmony. Her fifth Grammy win this month makes her the most awarded African musician of all time, and the cast of up-and-coming Afrobeat stars who contributed to “Mother Nature” cement her status as a living legend who’s helping to shape the next generation. For this show, Kidjo will be revisiting her 2018 project “Remain in Light,” a recreation of the 1980 Talking Heads album. $10-$55. 7:30 p.m. texasperformingarts.org. — D.S.S.\n\nRoyal Blood at Stubb’s\n\nOMD at ACL Live\n\nAntlers at Antone’s\n\nLala Kent at Emo’s\n\nFranc Moody at Scoot Inn\n\nPrince Daddy & the Hyena at Parish\n\nMay 13\n\nOlivia Rodrigo at Waterloo Park (sold out)\n\nLP at Stubb’s\n\nSyd at Scoot Inn\n\nMasked Singer at Bass Concert Hall\n\nLo Moon at 3Ten\n\nDehd at Antone’s\n\nMay 13-14\n\nEric Prydz at Concourse Project\n\nMay 14\n\nH-Town Throwdown at Round Rock Amp. Get ready to party like 2001 and the world just discovered the slowed-down grooves and souped up cars of Houston’s storied rap scene. This all-star cast of H-Town heavies includes a pantheon of kingpins from Geto Boys’ Scarface to UGK’s Bun B to the People’s Champ Paul Wall. If that’s not enough heat for you, Slim Thug, Z-ro, Lil' Flip, Mike Jones, Lil' Keke and DJ Michael 5000 Watts round out the bill. $30 and up. 6 p.m. roundrockamp.com. — D.S.S.\n\nRay LaMontagne, Sierra Ferrell at Waterloo Park\n\nPeter Poland at Scoot Inn\n\nMaxo Kream at Emo’s\n\n81355 at Mohawk indoor\n\nMay 15\n\nRuss at H-E-B Center\n\nLil Tecca at Emo’s\n\nEmily Scott Robinson at 3Ten\n\nPalms at Mohawk indoor\n\nMay 15-16\n\nWallows at Stubb’s (night two sold out)\n\nMay 17\n\nCarla Morrison at ACL Live\n\nStill Woozy at Stubb’s (sold out)\n\nDestroyer at Mohawk\n\nPrep at Empire Control Room\n\nT Pain at Emo’s\n\nMay 18\n\nBombino at Paramount Theatre\n\nHonne at Emo’s\n\nAfter the Burial, Thy Art Is Murder at Empire Garage\n\nMay 19\n\nOmar Apollo at Emo’s. After releasing three critically acclaimed EPs, the steamy R&B/pop singer dropped his debut full-length in April. It’s a sprawling album that includes guest appearances from Daniel Caesar and Pharrell Williams. The Indiana native’s silky falsetto and heartfelt balladry in English and Spanish have earned him indie heartthrob status; the new release aims to push him into the realm of mainstream hit-makers. Deb Never and Niko Rubio open. $29.50 and up. emosaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nDanzig, Cradle of Filth, Crobot at Stubb’s\n\nAnomalie at Antone’s\n\nVincint at Empire Control Room\n\nMay 19-20\n\nThe Eagles at Moody Center. When the Eagles last played Austin at the Erwin Center in 2015, Glenn Frey was still with them. His death in 2016 left Don Henley as the only remaining founding member. But guitarist Joe Walsh and bassist Timothy B. Schmidt, both of whom joined the Eagles in the 1970s, are still aboard, and the addition of platinum-selling country star Vince Gill to the lineup is an intriguing development. $195-$1,243. 8 p.m. moodycenteratx.com. — P.B.\n\nMay 20\n\nPhoebe Bridgers at Waterloo Park\n\nRex Orange County at Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nJimmie Allen, Neon Union at Haute Spot\n\nAly & AJ at Emo’s\n\nA Live One at Scoot Inn\n\nBroods at Antone’s\n\nPost Animal at Empire Control Room\n\nKings Kaleidoscope at Mohawk\n\nSeth Walker, Bonnie Bishop at 04 Center\n\nMay 21\n\nRaveena at Parish. For the past several years, this Indian American artist has been wooing us with soft-filter, queer-love anthems and introspective R&B explorations. On her latest release, “Asha’s Awakening,” a concept album about a Punjabi space princess, she stretches her sonic palette, mixing sunny pop songs like “Mystery” with the sparse hip-hop seduction “Secret” (featuring Vince Staples) and “Asha’s Kiss,” an airy bedroom burner with a steady tabla backbeat and passages in Hindi.

Austin violinist and singer-songwriter Rodriguez began these Laboratorio shows a few years ago and recently brought them back after an extended pandemic break. Past shows have mostly focused on connections with other local performers of Latin music, but this show broadens the series’ geographical and topical horizons. Singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno is a Guatemala native who lives in Los Angeles, while Oscar Cásares is a University of Texas creative writing professor and author of the books “Brownsville: Stories” and “Amigoland.” $25-$150. 7 p.m. austintheatre.org. — P.B.\n\nA Laboratorio of love: Carrie Rodriguez relaunches Latin-themed concert series in Austin\n\nDaryl Hall & the Daryl’s House Band at ACL Live\n\nBlack Violin at Long Center\n\nWeathers at Empire Control Room\n\nMay 23\n\nGang of Youths at Scoot Inn\n\nMay 23-24\n\nSigur Rós at ACL Live\n\nMay 24-25\n\nLukas Nelson & Promise of the Real at Stubb’s. When he’s not accompanying his father, Texas icon Willie Nelson, or touring in the band of Neil Young, another living legend of popular music, Lukas is often touring and recording with Promise of the Real, the band he’s fronted for more than a decade. They’ve released three excellent records in the past five years, including last year’s “A Few Stars Apart.” Expect selections from all of them in this two-night stand. $40-$45. 6:30 p.m. stubbsaustin.com. — P.B.\n\nMay 25\n\nJack White at Moody Center\n\nAllison Russell \"Austin City Limits\" taping at ACL Live\n\nHayden James, Cassian at Emo’s\n\nSon Lux, Kiah Victoria, Black Taffy at Scoot Inn\n\nHelado Negro at Mohawk\n\nVundabar at Empire Garage\n\nMay 26\n\nBig K.R.I.T., Elhae, Price at Emo’s\n\nMay 27-29\n\nWillie Nelson at Whitewater Amphitheater\n\nMay 27\n\nGrupo Fantasma with Joe Bataan at Paramount Theatre. The mighty 9-piece from Austin via Laredo has thrilled audiences around the globe with their world-class blend of hip-shimmying cumbia and border funk for over two decades. For this performance, the group will be joined by Joe Bataan, an Afro-Filipino artist who grew up in Spanish Harlem in the ‘50s and ‘60s surrounded by R&B, Afro-Cuban and Puerto Rican music. His synthesis of those sounds over a career that spanned four decades and 23 albums earned him the title “King of Latin Soul.” Group Fantasma will play a short set before backing Bataan for the rest of the night. Brown-eyed soul band Eddie and the Valiants from San Antonio opens. $20-$45. 8 p.m. austintheatre.org. — D.S.S.\n\nKathleen Edwards, John Paul White at Stateside at the Paramount\n\nStrand of Oaks at Antone’s\n\nSlaughter Beach, Dog, Trace Mountains at Empire Control Room\n\nMay 28\n\nMxmtoon at Antone’s\n\nEastghost at Empire Control Room\n\nSTS9, Sunsquabi, Golden Dawn Arkestra at Long Center\n\nMorgan James at 04 Center\n\nMay 29\n\nNoahfinnce, Sophie Powers at Empire Control Room\n\nMay 31\n\nAnimal Collective at Emo’s\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show at ACL Live\n\nAndy Grammer at Paramount Theatre\n\nJune 1\n\nNeko Case at Paramount Theatre. Like Wilco, Case first gained attention in the 1990s as an alt-country performer but soon gravitated more toward indie rock. Her commercial peak came with 2009’s “Middle Cyclone,” which reached No. 3 on the Billboard charts. She’s released just two solo albums since then and seems due for another, though those years also produced a splendid collaboration with K.D. Lang and Laura Veirs, plus a few more records with the New Pornographers. M.

The Mavericks arose from Florida in the 1990s as a country band, but they were always destined to be more than that, largely because of spectacular singer Raul Malo’s Cuban heritage. They wove in elements of Latin, jazz and other styles along the way, winning a Grammy for 2017’s “Brand New Day.” But 2020’s “En Español” was a breakthrough, the group’s first all-Spanish album. They’ll focus on that material at this concert, which brings them back to the room where they taped the “Austin City Limits” TV show without an audience during the pandemic. Maggie Rose opens. $32-$50. 8 p.m. acl-live.com. — P.B.\n\nJune 4\n\nThe Suffers at Mohawk. When we caught up with the Houston band’s vocal powerhouse, Kam Franklin, during SXSW, she said she used the pandemic break as a boot camp to build her already-formidable skills. As the band charges into their second decade, she believes “this is the tightest we've ever been,” she said, “and the most connected that we've ever been. We are ready to show a healthier, more energetic, more free version of the band.” This party celebrates the release of the band’s third studio album, “It Starts With Love,” which comes out on June 3. mohawkaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nSymphony X, Haken, Trope at Empire Garage\n\nWhores at Parish\n\nInfected Rain at Empire Control Room\n\nWillis Alan Ramsey at Saxon Pub\n\nJune 5\n\nLawrence, Misterwives at Stubb’s\n\nJim Messina at Haute Spot\n\nJune 5-6\n\nSteely Dan at ACL Live\n\nJune 6\n\nKishi Bashi at Mohawk. The singer-songwriter and violinist, aka Kaoru Ishibashi, was in Austin during SXSW for the world premiere of his new documentary “Omoiyari,” a meditation on World War II Japanese internment camps that unfolds as a powerful exploration of his Japanese American heritage. Ishibashi just released a 10-year anniversary edition of “151a,” the debut full-length that launched his solo career. He celebrates by playing a track-by-track setlist of the whole album. $25. 6:30 p.m. mohawkaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nSlenderbodies at Scoot Inn\n\nJune 7\n\nAlyssa Edwards at Paramount Theatre\n\nJune 8\n\nHerb Alpert & Lani Hall at Paramount Theatre. Still touring at age 87, Alpert has led a legendary life, from his 1960s instrumental hits leading the Tijuana Brass band to co-founding the influential label A&M Records with Jerry Moss. He’s won eight Grammys (plus a Lifetime Achievement Award) and a Tony; was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006; and received the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama in 2013. He’s worked often over the decades with his wife, singer Lani Hall; she’ll join him for this concert. Tickets to the originally scheduled Jan. 27 date will be honored. $35-$55. 8 p.m. austintheatre.org. — P.B.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly at Moody Center\n\nJune 9\n\nSarah Darling, Thomas Csorba at 04 Center\n\nJune 10\n\nDishwalla at Haute Spot\n\nJune 11\n\nJimmy Buffett at Moody Center. Though Buffett has long been big enough to play the biggest hall in town, occasionally Austin gets treated to smaller-venue shows, because he typically rehearses here with his band before heading on tour. We last saw him with a yard full of Parrotheads at Stubb’s in 2015, but this time he’s helping to break in the new Moody Center. Expect plenty of margaritas to be served when he revisits the city where he wrote “Margaritaville” in the 1970s. $54-$969. 8 p.m. moodycenteratx.com. — P.B.\n\nEarthgang at Emo’s. It is very tempting to cast the Atlanta duo, who lace sharp lyricism with syrupy Southern harmonies, as the next Outkast. Like the “ATLiens,” they unwind street wisdom and understand the power of a soulful hook. But their sound is distinctly post-trap, with a millennial approach to social issues that informs songs like the mental health check-in “Strong Friends.” Along with the rest of their Spillage Village crew, which includes Dreamville labelmates J.I.D. and R&B singer 6lack, they are emerging as leaders of the next generation and this is probably your last chance to catch them at a mid-size venue. $38-$99. 7 p.m. doors. emosaustin.com. — D.S.S.\n\nAmos Lee at ACL Live\n\nBelle & Sebastian, Los Bitchos at Stubb’s\n\nCactus Blossoms at 3Ten\n\nJune 12\n\nUmi at Scoot Inn\n\nJune 13\n\nJesse McCartney at Emo’s\n\nArcadian Wild at 04 Center\n\nJune 14\n\nAs I Lay Dying, Whitechapel, Shadow Of Intent, Ov Sulfur at Empire Garage\n\nLast Dinosaurs at Antone’s\n\nBrit Floyd at ACL Live\n\nFailure at Mohawk\n\nJune 15\n\nCalexico at Scoot Inn. Touring bands largely stayed off the road over the past couple of years, but Arizona’s eclectic Calexico kept busy enough in the studio to produce two albums. “Seasonal Shift” came out in December 2020, followed this month by “El Mirador.” It’s now been a quarter-century since Joey Burns and John Convertino spun off from Giant Sand to create this cinematic desert-rock band with Mexican influences, and they seem to get better with each passing year. $30-$35. 6 p.m. doors. scootinnaustin.com. — P.B.\n\nPuscifer at Bass Concert Hall\n\nJoe Jackson at Paramount Theatre\n\nJune 16\n\nDean Lewis at Emo’s\n\nShenandoah at Haute Spot\n\nJune 17\n\nBroncho at Empire Garage\n\nLéon at Scoot Inn\n\nGreer at Empire Control Room\n\nCasey Donahew at Haute Spot\n\nJune 18\n\nTy Segall & Freedom Band at Mohawk\n\nPenelope Scott at Empire Control Room\n\nCrystal Gayle at Haute Spot\n\nJune 20\n\nWeather Station at 3Ten. Singer-songwriter Tamara Lindeman’s Canadian outfit is known for elegantly arranged indie-folk music that incorporates horns and winds, but there’s also activism in their approach: “Ignorance,” the group’s acclaimed 2021 album, addressed climate change. Last month’s “How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars” is the Weather Station’s sixth album since its 2009 debut, “The Line.” $20-$23. 8 p.m. 3tenaustin.com. — P.B.\n\nJune 21\n\nAldous Harding at Mohawk\n\nThrice, Bayside at Emo’s\n\nJune 22\n\nAndrea Bocelli at Moody Center\n\nBoz Scaggs at Paramount Theatre\n\nJune 23\n\nKeshi at Emo’s\n\nJune 24\n\n5 Seconds of Summer, Pale Waves at Waterloo Park\n\nSteve Earle & the Dukes, Whitmore Sisters at Gruene Hall\n\nTom Kiefer Band, LA Guns, Faster Pussycat at Haute Spot\n\nJune 25\n\nCrowder at Round Rock Amp\n\nMewithoutYou at Mohawk\n\nRadney Foster at Gruene Hall\n\nRobert Earl Keen at Whitewater Amphitheater\n\nJune 26\n\nDenzel Curry at Stubb’s. For the most part, the rapidly rising Miami rapper eschews club bangers for reflective self-exploration on “Melt My Eyez See Your Future,” his fifth studio album. He flexes his jazz chops over a feathery vocal hook from Bridget Perez on “Mental” and gets battle ready with funk innovator Thundercat on “The Smell of Death.” Will it be a kinder, gentler Curry show?

When Carlile first gained attention with her 2005 self-titled debut album, it was hard to know just how influential and broad-reaching her music would become. Early on, she was more of an indie-folk artist, but she soon gravitated toward Americana, winning a Grammy in that category for her 2018 album, “By the Way, I Forgive You.” Then came a crossover into country: She spearheaded the formation of supergroup the Highwomen, and she produced a comeback album for Tanya Tucker. Her live performances are very much a band affair, with twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth a significant part of her sound and show. $125-$365. 7 p.m. waterloogreenway.org. — P.B.\n\nFrom 2018: Brandi Carlile sings out and speaks up in ACL Fest set\n\nPurity Ring, Dawn Richard at ACL Live.

Then a shocking scandal in which she was accused of grooming young singers to become sex slaves for her manager and mentor sent her to jail for almost five years. She was exonerated due to a lack of evidence in 2004.

The summer season closes with Lyric's July 19-24 production of \"Kinky Boots.\"\n\nHelmed by Producing Artistic Director Michael Baron, Lyric's \"Carousel\" is gorgeously staged, superbly sung and sensitively told. The title, which Time magazine in 1999 named the top musical of the 20th century, boasts some of the most beloved show tunes in theater history but also tells a heartwrenching tale of a dysfunctional marriage complicated by domestic violence, poverty and suicide.\n\nOperatic storytelling spins through 'Carousel'\n\nComposer Richard Rodgers (1902-1979) and lyricist and book writer Oscar Hammerstein II (1895-1960) followed up the trailblazing success of their 1943 collaboration \"Oklahoma!\" with \"Carousel,\" which bowed on Broadway in 1945 and immediately became their second straight critical and commercial hit. As with \"Oklahoma!,\" they tapped choreographer Agnes de Mille to help tell the story of \"Carousel\" through dance as well as song.\n\nAnd just as they based their \"Oklahoma!\" on the play \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" by Claremore native Lynn Riggs, Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted \"Carousel\" from author Ferenc Molnár's Hungarian-language drama \"Liliom.\" Although Rodgers and Hammerstein won the rights, it's worth noting that Italian opera icon Giacomo Puccini also was interested in adapting the title, because there's a distinctly operatic spin to \"Carousel.\"\n\nSet in a coastal village in Maine near the end of the 19th century, \"Carousel\" revolves around Billy Bigelow (Joe Caskey) a cocky carnival barker, who meets and marries Julie Jordan (Julianne Reynolds), a gentle millworker, when she visits the carousel with her feisty friend and co-worker Carrie (Anette Barrios-Torres).\n\nBilly and Julie are an unlikely pair, but they are undeniably drawn to each other and immediately make sacrifices for each other. Julie loses her job at the mill by defying the mandatory curfew to stay out late and keep talking to Billy, and he loses his carousel gig when he tells off its jealous owner, Mrs. Mullin (Lindsie VanWinkle-Guthrie), for harrassing Julie.\n\nBilly and Julie soon marry, and Julie's supportive cousin Nettie (Courtney Crouse) lets them live at her spa. Still, their lack of funds quickly becomes a problem, and Billy hits Julie during a fight about it. Carrie, who is in the midst of her own courtship with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow (Colin Anderson), encourages Julie to leave Billy but she staunchly refuses.\n\nWhen Billy learns that Julie is pregnant, he becomes desperate to provide a decent life for his family. His shady sailor pal Jigger (Joseph Campbell) convinces Billy to take part in a robbery, but it goes terribly wrong.\n\nLyric Theatre's 'Carousel' puts orchestra on stage with ensemble\n\n\"Carousel\" revolves around universal themes like relationships and redemption and even life and death, with much of the second act set in the afterlife. And in the way of Golden Age musicals, it does its most effective storytelling through song and dance.\n\nCaskey, who played the Escapologist in Lyric's June production of \"Matilda\" and Danny in the OKC theater's 2021 staging of \"Grease,\" and Reynolds, who appeared last year in Lyric's \"Master Class,\" establish both a crackling chemistry and their vocal chops with \"If I Loved You.\" He delivers the seven and a half-minute operatic \"Soliloquy\" that closes the first act with fantastic flair, and she lifts the wistful \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\" to great heights.\n\nCrouse, who co-directed Lyric's \"Master Class,\" practically stops the show with her soaring rendition of the beloved anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone.\"\n\nBarrios-Torres, who appeared last summer in Lyric's \"Grease,\" and Colin Anderson, who is fresh off the national tour of \"My Fair Lady\" that played OKC last fall, charm as the sassy and loyal Carrie and her stuffy yet loveable beau Enoch Snow.\n\nMaking her Lyric Theatre debut, Anna McGuire proves magnetic as Billy and Julie's troubled daughter Louise, who pours her teenage angst into the show's stunning second act ballet.\n\nThe entire ensemble excels at both song and dance, especially on big, raucous numbers like \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over,\" \"Blow High, Blow Low\" and \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake.\"\n\nScenic designer Kimberly Powers' clever set concept puts the skilled 16-member orchestra, conducted by longtime Lyric Theatre collaborator David Andrews Rogers, right on stage, making the legendarily beautiful score feel even more alive and immediate.\n\nRodgers considered \"Carousel\" his favorite of all the musicals he worked on with Hammerstein or his other partners. The show isn't recommended for young children, but teenage or grown-up musical theater fans should certainly give it a whirl.\n\nLYRIC THEATRE'S 'CAROUSEL'\n\nWhen: Through July 10.\n\nWhere: Civic Center Music Hall, 201 N Walker.\n\nTickets and information: https://lyrictheatreokc.com/shows/carousel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2023/09/29/banned-books-read-these-books-now-and-why-in-defense-of-books/71008499007/", "title": "Banned books: Why you should read these 51 books right now", "text": "USA TODAY staff\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAs journalists, it's our job to seek out the truth even when it's uncomfortable. We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\n'All Boys Aren’t Blue' by George M. Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/bicentennial/2024/03/04/tlh-200-the-200-people-who-shaped-tallahassee-ahead-of-bicentennial/72795474007/", "title": "TLH 200: The 200 people who shaped Tallahassee ahead of ...", "text": "James Call and Greg Tish\n\nTLH 200 writers\n\nThe TLH 200: Gerald Ensley Memorial Bicentennial Project is proud to present our rolling list of 200 people who laid the foundation and contributed to the growth of the civil society we find today in Tallahassee.\n\nAs the city commemorates the 200th anniversary of its founding, the Tallahassee Democrat and Real Talk 93.3 have cast a wide net to find artists, educators, civil rights leaders, politicians, athletes, builders, business titans and neighborhood icons who have earned a spotlight.\n\nBut we need your help.\n\nYou can email your suggestions of candidates to be profiled and other suggestions to history@tallahassee.com. And listen to Greg Tish’s morning show on Real Talk 93.3 where we'll discuss the legacy of these history makers.\n\nThe only condition is that those featured below must be deceased. Ten names will be added periodically, so be sure to check back for updates into 2025.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the first 100 names.\n\nJustice James Diament Westcott, Jr. (1839 - 1887)\n\nTallahassee born James Diament Westcott III, who preferred “Junior” rather than James the Third, had a knack for law and politics.\n\nBy the age of 28, Westcott served as the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate, the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry, and as a captain in the Confederate States Army.\n\nAfter the war he was elected as a Leon County representative to the Florida House.\n\nThe year he turned 30, he was elected attorney general. It was a remarkable feat because Westcott ran as a Democrat in the year a new Florida Constitution gave voting rights to freed slaves who registered as Republicans and the GOP won in landslides up and down the ballot.\n\nWithin a few weeks of the election Republican Gov. Harrison Reed appointed Westcott to the Florida Supreme Court, making him the youngest justice in Florida history.\n\nHe would serve for 17 years and would write 267 opinions – the most in Florida history.\n\nWestcott received his entire academic education at West Florida Seminary – which would become Florida State University, for which he was eternally grateful.\n\nUpon his death, he left his entire estate to West Florida Seminary. The principal would produce about $69,000 annually.\n\nThat was enough to provide a financial lifeline for the struggling institution – the stability needed for the school to evolve into a state-supported university. Today, a portion of the proceeds goes toward financial assistance for low-income students.\n\nWestcott died in 1887 and is buried in Tallahassee’s Old City Cemetery. In 1936, Florida State University named its administration building in his honor.\n\nGilbert Chandler (1889 - 1978)\n\nIn 1925, a Minnesota asparagus farmer was disappointed when he stopped for a night in Tallahassee – he found no place to stay, not even space to pitch a tent.\n\nThe disappointment would lead Gilbert Chandler to build a Tallahassee landmark, The Cottages of Lake Ella.\n\nChandler had $2,000 in his pocket when he ventured out of the land of lakes to seek his fortune as a “Tin Can Tourist,” the nickname for motorists touring the countryside at the dawn of the auto age.\n\nIn California, he stayed at an “auto camp,” cottages furnished with a bench, table and electric light.\n\nChandler told Susan Poplin for a Florida State University history thesis that the two-room cabins cost $750 to build and produced a 400% annual profit.\n\nChandler considered himself a Horatio Alger up-from-the-bootstrap character and after a quick look around a tiny state capital city that would soon be located at the intersection of two proposed U.S. highways (27 & 90), he decided to stay and pioneer auto camping in Florida.\n\nFirst, he paid $400 for some lots along the railroad tracks on Gaines Street. He built 10 cabins and a communal washroom and charged $1 a night to stay.\n\nTwo years later, he bought five acres north of town and built the Tallahassee Tourist Camp along a dirt road at Lake Ella. Once the road was paved and became U.S. 27, he expanded his camp with the Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of the highway and the Lake Ella Motor Court on the east side.\n\nThe motor court consisted of 15 cottages. They were converted into apartments during a World War II housing shortage and rented for $30 a month.\n\nChandler used the money to upgrade the cottages with carpets, steam heat and the latest innovations. At war’s end and a tourism boom underway, Chandler promoted the Lake Ella Motor Court with hand-made billboards across the southeast.\n\nHe posted 4-by-8 feet red and yellow silkscreen painted signs advertising a motor court on the shore of Tallahassee's “beautiful Lake Ella,” every 10 miles on roads leading into and out of Birmingham, Atlanta, Daytona Beach, Tampa and the panhandle.\n\nOne night while out posting signs, “Dad called home to ask about business and Mom said they were full. People told her they’d been following the signs for hundreds of miles just to stop for the night,” Gilbert Chandler Jr., told the Tallahassee Democrat’s Andy Lindstrom in 1995 for a history of the Lake Ella cottages.\n\nAfter Gilbert Chandler passed, his heirs retired from the hospitality business. What had grown into the 92-room Tallahassee Motor Hotel on the west side of Monroe was torn down in the 1990s to make room for a Golden Corral restaurant.\n\nAcross the street, 11 of the original 15 cottages still stand, converted into specialty shops for the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\nTheir once white trim now is blue and grey, the multi-colored shingles replaced with brown ones, but they still sport marble facades. It is said, when a ton of marble was accidentally delivered to Tallahassee, Chandler bought it for a bargain to spruce up his cottages.\n\nChandler was a World War I veteran, Free Mason, and a Shriner who built an iconic Tallahassee destination after a disappointing first night in town.\n\nAquilina Howell (1917 - 2000)\n\nAquilina Howell was born on West Georgia Street and would go on to spend 42 years working in Leon County schools as a teacher and administrator.\n\nWhat's in a name? The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nHowell was the first woman to serve as an Assistant Superintendent in Leon County and is credited as the driving force behind the peaceful desegregation of Tallahassee's public schools\n\n“Aquilina had unbelievable processing skills,\" said former school superintendent Charles Couch who appointed her assistant superintendent. “She could take angry people, get them to look at the issues calmly, and solve the problem in win-win fashion for everyone.”\n\nCouch, and others, recall how Howell led Leon schools during desegregation without the discord and violence that plagued other communities.\n\n“She could always make you calm down and see the other person’s point and make you think you did all the solving,” her sister Lucille Alexander told Gerald Ensley at Howell’s passing. “I used to say to her, ‘All right, Mr. Ralph Bunche.’” (Bunche was the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize.)\n\nHowell was married for 51 years to Tallahassee insurance agent Sam Howell, who passed in 1994. Howell died in 2000.\n\nThe Taylor House, where she was born, is now a museum celebrating Frenchtown and the Tallahassee Civil Rights movement.\n\nIn recognition of the path, she set a path for educators, civil activists, and community leaders, supporters created the Aquilina C. Howell Education Scholarship at Florida A&M University for first- and second-year students who graduated from a Leon County high school.\n\nAnd Howell’s name can still be spotted around town; including the Leon County schools administrative building on West Pensacola Street, and the Carter-Howell-Strong Park in Frenchtown.\n\nCarrie Meek (1926 - 2021)\n\nCarrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper’s daughter as a child, was not allowed to enter the Florida State Capitol because she was Black.\n\nAs a 12-year-old Girl Scout, Meek was blocked at the front door when white members of her Girl Scout Troop delivered home-made brownies to Florida lawmakers. As a Lincoln High School and Florida A&M University graduate, she would be the first Black woman to represent Florida in the U.S. Congress since Reconstruction.\n\nWillie and Carrie Pittman’s daughter broke many racial, gender, and educational barriers.\n\nIn a 1992 interview with the Washington Post, she recalled in Jim Crow Tallahassee there weren’t any decent recreational facilities for Black people, and because she was Black, she couldn’t try on shoes in stores or pursue a master’s degree in her hometown.\n\nMeek earned a Master of Science at the University of Michigan after being awarded a B.S. in biology at FAMU in 1948, and after a career as a South Florida educator she would win a 1979 special election to represent Miami in the Florida House.\n\nIn 1982, she became the first Black woman elected to the Florida Senate.\n\nAs a politician, Meek was an unapologetic Democrat firebrand with an agenda rooted in the inequities she lived and witnessed.\n\nShe is remembered as an advocate for minorities, immigrants, and the working poor. And as someone who routinely intensified the debate.\n\nIn Tallahassee when Meek wanted to kill a bill, she would stand on the floor and wave a black flag of death adorned with a skull and crossbones.\n\nIn 1994, Meek provoked a massive argument with new Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. She chided Gingrich for negotiating a multi-million-dollar book deal with a publishing company that had a stake in telecommunications legislation.\n\nMeek said Gingrich stood “to make a whole lot of dust” from the deal.\n\nRepublicans struck Meek’s comments from the Congressional Record. The argument that followed dominated the coverage of the New York Times, Washington Post, and the television news networks.\n\n“The only thing missing up here is my black flag,” Meek told the Miami Herald at the time.\n\nCarrie Meek never lost an election. She retired from politics in 2002.\n\nThe Carrie Meek – James N. Eaton, Sr. Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum in Tallahassee, Florida, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is co-named in Meek's honor.\n\nHenry Livingston Rutgers (1810 - 1861)\n\nIn 1836, Henry Livingston Rutgers, direct kin of the namesake of Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey, married Jane Barnwall and the two moved to Tallahassee.\n\nFlorida Territorial Gov. William P. Duval had appointed Henry the Territorial Administrator and Treasurer.\n\nRutgers would go on to serve the territory and city for more than two decades. And although he was an early and apparently prominent settler, little is written about him.\n\nIn 1845, Rutgers cast a vote as an elector for the first Florida State Governor, William Dunn Moseley.\n\nRutgers also served two terms on the Tallahassee City Council and Circuit Court Judge Jesse J. Finely appointed him as an investigator in the renowned Croom-Smith Case of 1857 – which decided ownership of Goodwood Plantation’s 200 enslaved workers.\n\nIn 1856, the Floridian and Journal newspaper, according to the Tallahassee Heritage Foundation, reported the opening of a new state bank on Monroe Street, to which the paper added, \"We are indebted to Mr. H. L. Rutgers.\"\n\nThe Foundation suggests that druggist B. C. Lewis, who opened his own bank that year had bought the building from Rutgers.\n\nRutgers hired freedman George Proctor to build him two homes in Tallahassee – the Randall-Lewis House at 424 North Calhoun St., and the Rutgers House across Calhoun and now the Tallahassee Garden Center.\n\nIt was in a cabin on Rutgers’ Calhoun St property where Antonio Proctor, the scout and interpreter for the Simmons/Williams expedition that selected the site for Florida’s capital city, would pass in 1855.\n\nFredrich R. Cotten (1819 - 1878)\n\nFredrich R. Cotten had big plans for Florida when he came to Tallahassee in 1845. He got himself elected to the first Florida House of Representatives and then he developed a vast section of land that is today upper-middle class neighborhoods in north, northwest Tallahassee into the second largest cotton plantation in Leon County.\n\nSixty years later his grandson, Fred Cotten Elliot, would have even bigger land use plans.\n\nHe would try to drain the Everglades.\n\nBy 1850, Virginian Fredrich R. Cotten had transformed a wide swath of what is now north Tallahassee and west Leon County into a $12 million – in today's money – cotton growing operation.\n\nThat land today is a collection of upper middle class subdivisions, a country club, and Lake Jackson boat landings.\n\nCotten’s Burgesstown Plantation took in more than 8,000 acres from the Ochlocknee River and Lake Iamonia south to the Luna Pines neighborhood, east through Phipps-Overstreet Park and the eastern shore of Lake Jackson to Miller's Landing, then north to Golden Eagle Plantation, and Killearn Lakes Plantation.\n\nAccounting records indicate that shipments of cotton went regularly from Burgesstown via St. Marks to New York with proceeds credited to Cotten.\n\nThe Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows Cotten was the single largest slaveholder in the county, with 275 enslaved workers.\n\nWhen Cotten passed in 1878, he was buried at Saint John's Episcopal Church Cemetery.\n\nCotten's heirs would sell Burgesstown to Lloyd Griscom of Philadelphia who in 1901 converted the land into a quail hunting plantation. Griscom’s son, Lloyd Carpenter Griscom, would purchase the Tallahassee Democrat in 1929 and the family would own the paper until 1965.\n\nCotten's grandson Fred Cotten Elliot became the state's chief civil engineer at the Internal Improvement Fund, now the Department of Environmental Protection. In 1913, Elliot developed a plan and directed an effort to drain the Everglades to create farmland.\n\nElliot joined a team of eight that hack through sawgrass to clear a path for barges, and he designed the first giant swamp buggies that allowed construction crews and farm workers to operate in the marshes of the Everglades.\n\nWhen he got back home after his Everglades adventure, Elliot laid out the first few holes of the Capital City Country Club golf course.\n\nThe state-owned Elliot Building, on the SE corner of Pensacola and Monroe, across from the Capitol was named for him. It is scheduled to be demolished and the site will become a Memorial Park, whose purpose is to honor Florida history and commemorate victims of slavery and the Holocaust.\n\nJayleen Woods (1934 - 2006)\n\nIn 1972, Jayleen Woods was included in a Tallahassee Democrat story about women who had “invaded” “men only” professions like public relations managers, commonly referred to as \"spokesmen\" by the media.\n\nWoods was a wordsmith. She was a writer and editor for the Florida Flambeau, Tallahassee Democrat and Tampa Tribune. Woods also worked 17 years as the Director of Information Services at Florida State University, where she served as the university’s spokesperson, and later as the editor of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association magazine for 30 years.\n\nWoods said she had “printer’s ink in her veins.”\n\nShe got a big infusion of it after a poem she wrote as a 12-year-old, about a volunteer group called The Red Feathers, appeared on the front page of her hometown newspaper in Bristol, CT.\n\nFive years later, she accepted a writing scholarship to Florida State University, where she would become a member of the Flying High Circus and edit the student newspaper the Florida Flambeau.\n\nAfter graduating from FSU, Woods took a job with the Tampa Tribune and then met Tom Woods of Tallahassee. That would lead to a move back to the Capital City and Woods breaking glass ceilings as she moved into management positions that previously were a male domain.\n\nTom and Jayleen were married for 48 years and had two daughters. He preceded her in death.\n\nIn retirement, Jayleen created fund-raising brochures for the Girl Scout Council and its Apalachee Camp for All Seasons. She also remained active with the League of Women Voters, Springtime Tallahassee, the Women’s Club of Tallahassee, and the Seminole Boosters.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker (1844 - 1903)\n\nA native of British Sierra Leon, Thomas DeSaille Tucker was a lawyer and missionary who became the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students, which became Florida A&M University.\n\nHe was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio and taught at schools for emancipated slaves in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law office in Pensacola.\n\nTucker devoted his life to combatting slavery, according to a Oberlin College biography.\n\n\"The colored men in this country have no voice in the general government; even in some of the States they have no voice in the State government,\" he wrote to a friend in Africa. \"It would fairly sicken you to be here on a fourth of July and hear guns firing and 'starspangled banner' waving 'over the land of the free and the home of the brave' while there are this day 4,000,000 of slaves in their possession. O what a hypocrisy. God will not always sleep but will yet come in judgment against this country except they speedily repent.\"\n\nIn 1887, Tucker accepted appointment as the first president of the State Normal College for Colored Students in DeFuniak Springs. With an infusion of federal money, Tucker moved the school to Tallahassee onto property once owned by Gov. Willliam Duval.\n\nWhen the State Board of Education selected Tucker to be the school’s first president, the editor of a local newspaper wrote:\n\n“We have known Professor Tucker for about 18 years and we have never met a more genial, broadminded and sterling gentleman. He possesses first-class qualities as a friend, gentleman and scholar, and commands the respect of all who know him. He is a strong man, morally and intellectually, and the new Normal has a security of success under his charge.”\n\nTucker served as president until an argument with William N. Sheats over the school’s direction. Sheats wanted Tucker to focus on agricultural and industrial education, Tucker insisted on a liberal arts education.\n\nSheats was appointed Superintendent in 1895 and slowly reduced Tucker’s authority and reduced the school’s budget and questioned spending until Tucker was finally ousted in 1901.\n\nTucker moved to Jacksonville where he practiced law until his death in 1903.\n\nThe Sims; Robert (1924 - 1966), Helen (1932 - 1966), Joy (1954 - 1966)\n\nThree members of the Sims family are the victims in a story that local lore holds as the moment Tallahassee lost its innocence.\n\nOctober 22, 1966, was a football Saturday and that night 30,000 people, more than half of the city’s population, attended the Mississippi State University vs. Florida State University football game at Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nRobert Sims, the director of data processing for the Department of Education, Helen Sims, a former secretary for First Baptist Church, and their 12-year-old daughter Joy did not.\n\nVicious killers invaded their home in a quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood and the three were found bound, gagged and shot shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nRobert and Joy passed at the scene. Helen was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness to provide any clues to the killers. She died nine days later.\n\nSixteen-year-old ambulance attendant Rocky Bevis was among the first responders to the crime scene. He cut the bonds on all three victims at their ankles and wrists.\n\n\"We just woke up one morning in Tallahassee and we were part of an evil world,” he recalled to the Miami Herald for a story marking the 50th anniversary of the crime.\n\nBefore that October night, Tallahassee was a place where people did not lock their doors.\n\nBut as word of the murders spread, homes started to be kept locked at all hours, doors not opened to strangers, shades were drawn at dusk. And when no arrests were made, people bought watchdogs, hardware stores ran out of locks and safety door chains, and there was a rush at gun shops.\n\nFear spread through the city to the extent that Trick or Treat was cancelled that Halloween.\n\nA Tallahassee Democrat editorial stated, “This is no night to send young children in masks and costumes into the street.”\n\nA $16,000 reward was never collected. The murder weapons were never found. A motive never established.\n\nSheriff deputies had two suspects in their sights, and nearly 1,000 fingerprints collected at the scene but never secured enough evidence to bring any charges.\n\nThe late Leon County Sheriff Larry Campbell investigated the murders as a deputy and continued to probe the case through a 53-year law enforcement career.\n\n“I’ve done everything I think I can do,” he told the Miami Herald in 2006. “The big frustration is that I feel very confident that I know who did it.”\n\nThe case remains unsolved. Campbell passed in 2014.\n\nEd Ball (1888 - 1981)\n\nFrom the dark days of the depression and until his death in 1981, Ed Ball was one of the most powerful and feared men in Florida.\n\nBall owned a 7,500-acre farm outside of Tallahassee that today is the Southwood subdivision.\n\nThe brother-in-law of Alfred I. du Pont, Ed Ball managed du Pont’s finances and once Alfred died grew a $56-million du Pont trust into a $2-billion Florida empire, according to the Wall Street firm A.G. Becker.\n\nA du Pont grandson filed suit against Ball for spending too much money to make more money instead of on the charitable organizations the elder du Pont included as the trust’s beneficiaries.\n\nAmong the trust’s holdings were more than 1 million acres of north Florida timberland, the St. Joe Paper Company, Florida East Coast Railway, Apalachicola Northern Railroad Co., Florida National Bank, Talisman Sugar Corp, Florida Sugar Refinery Inc., and St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph.\n\nThe news wire service UPI remembered Ball as a quick-witted man with “the courtly manners of a Southern gentleman” who loved a good scrap.\n\nHe was the father of the state sales tax, lobbying 20 years for it as a substitute for property taxes.\n\nA political kingmaker, Ball supported financially the so-called “Porkchop Gang,” a group of rural legislators who couldn’t have been elected without him. In the 1960s the group opposed legislative reapportionment because as Ball explained it would mean “the two organized minorities, the NAACP, and the (labor) unions will control the state.”\n\nWhen Florida East Coast Railway workers went on strike in 1963, Ball defied the Justice Department and a presidential emergency board and refused to budge on the wage issue which triggered the strike.\n\nThe strike continued until 1976.\n\nBall founded the St. Joe Paper Company in 1936. The company’s extensive use of water (35 million gallons daily) and clear-cutting of forests (98% of the region’s longleaf pine) led the U.S. Department of Interior in the 1970s to designate parts of North Florida a “Critically Endangered Ecosystem.”\n\nBall purchased 4,000 acres surrounding Wakulla Springs in 1937 and constructed the 27-room Wakulla Springs Lodge as a guest house. He used dynamite to open a channel to the Wakulla River so guests could arrive by boat. And he fenced off the water passage to keep out the “riff raff.”\n\nThe state acquired the land in 1986 and created Ed Ball Wakulla Springs State Park.\n\nRuth Chapman (1918 - 1983)\n\nWhen Ruth Chapman passed away it was big news; “Tallahassee activist Chapman dies at 65.”\n\nChapman studied at Northwestern University School of Journalism and worked at newspapers in Illinois and Florida before arriving in Tallahassee in 1946.\n\n“Ruth was sort of a crusader for the improvement of Tallahassee,” said former AP writer Hendrix Chandler upon Chapman’s death.\n\nRuth and Harold Chapman moved here after the war, Harold had been stationed in Pensacola and Ruth reported for the Pensacola News Journal.\n\nIn Tallahassee, Ruth was the Women’s Editor for the Tallahassee Democrat for seven years and then editor of the Department of Education Florida School Magazine for 14 years.\n\nAway from journalism, Chapman was a member of at least 12 civic groups, including being a charter member of boards for the Tallahassee Junior Museum, Leon County Public Library, and Tallahassee Junior College, along with being president of the League of Women Voters and serving two terms on the Tallahassee-Leon County planning commission.\n\nRuth was respected as a literary craftswoman. Laurence R. Campbell, who was a 1936 Northwestern classmate, wrote at the time of her passing that Chapman was, “an architect of perceptive and penetrating prose.”\n\nChapman wrote lengthy policy letters to former Gov. LeRoy Collins. Collins said he never threw away any of them.\n\n“The one thing I attach more to Ruth than anything else is her beautiful, beautiful letter writing . . . She was a professional person, and she knew English and could express herself very well,” said Collins in 1981.\n\nEventually Collins had Chapman review his speeches and letters. He said since she was so intent on telling him what she thought, he thought he would let her know what he was thinking.\n\n“She was an excellent neighbor,” Collins said.\n\nJack Crow (1939 - 2004)\n\nJack Crow completed the longest of long shots.\n\nIn a scientific competition with the renowned private Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its $23.5 billion endowment, a little-known physicist from a state school (endowment $947 million) won the world’s most powerful magnet and brought it home to Tallahassee.\n\nIt was 1990 and MIT had run the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for three decades. But Crow and others developed a plan that included a consortium of Florida State University, the University of Florida and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to move the lab to FSU.\n\nThe Maglab, as its called, uses up to 30 megawatts of power – roughly the amount needed to power a community of 50,000 – to create high-level magnetic fields for experiments that further the understanding of matter and living structures.\n\nSmaller labs are in Moscow; Amsterdam; Grenoble, France, and cities in Poland and Japan.\n\nAt Crow's passing, former FSU president T.K. Wetherell recalled being lobbied for millions of dollars by Crow to move the lab to Tallahassee.\n\n“He had the ability to talk molecules and the ability to talk dollars in a way that made sense to an old politician,” said Wetherell.\n\nThe lab draws thousands of scientists to Tallahassee annually to conduct experiments that help develop new technologies and materials.\n\n\"The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory truly is the house that Jack built, \" said Greg Boebinger, who replaced Crow as head of the lab director in 2002.\n\nWhile the public knew Crow as a stellar scientist, a visionary, and a persistent lobbyist, family and friends knew a man with a soft touch.\n\nThey said Crow would return from international trips with fewer clothes than when he left – having given away shirts to struggling scientists elsewhere.\n\nHis sons recalled a dad who regularly ate peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches with them, liked to fish and build sandcastles with his grandchildren, and enjoyed a good story about someone beating the odds.\n\n“He needed a towel to cry in while watching the movie ‘Rudy,’” his son Garth Crow said at his passing.\n\nJoan Heggen (1930 - 2016)\n\nJoan Heggen was a game changer with a quick wit. In 1972 she became the first woman elected to the city commission.\n\nHeggen had taught speech at Utah State University before she moved to Tallahassee when her husband accepted a position at Florida State University in 1969.\n\nShe ran a grass-roots campaign out of an abandoned gas station with volunteers going house-to-house explaining why Tallahassee had to do things differently – at the time the commission was made up of businessmen who often conducted city business from their private offices.\n\nHeggen beat Lee Everhart, who had just finished a term as mayor, 59% to 41%.\n\nIn office, the Eau Claire, Wisc., native did things differently.\n\nHeggen became the first commissioner to have an office at City Hall and her presence forced immediate changes.\n\nAt the time women were not allowed to wear pants or boots to work. But Heggen routinely wore pants suits and boots. And the city clerk was unable to dictate a commissioner's dress, so the prohibition fell for all employees.\n\nAs mayor in 1974, Heggen formed a “kitchen cabinet” of citizens to advise her, initiated the city's first applications for federal grants, and Tallahassee became nationally active in the League of Cities.\n\nHeggen would join with commissioners Russell Bevis and Johnnie Jones to replace longtime city manager Arvah Hopkins with the professionally trained Dan Kleman.\n\nTwenty years later, Bevis would tell Tallahassee Democrat columnist Gerald Ensley, “I don’t know if I ever saw a person better prepared for meetings.”\n\nHeggen read, studied, and asked questions. She credited her dogged determination to the parochial school she attended growing up in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I was taught by Benedictine nuns, so I have G.U.I.L.T. tattooed across my boobs,\" Heggen told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nHeggen did not run for reelection in 1975. She became deputy director and then secretary of the Department of Community Affairs and then the Broward County's Director of Health and Public Safety.\n\nShe returned to Tallahassee in 1987 and joined Leon County as the assistant administrator.\n\nJoan Heggen retired in 1994. Upon her retirement the Leon County Commission issued a proclamation naming Joan Heggin “mother emeritus” of the Leon County Courthouse.\n\nWally \"Famous\" Amos (1936 - 2024)\n\nTallahassee’s most famous maker of chocolate chip cookies was born on Lafayette Street in the raised Smokey Hollow neighborhood where the Department of Transportation building and Cascades Park is today.\n\nWhen he was 12 his parents divorced, and Amos was sent to live with an aunt in New York City. She loved to bake, and aunt and nephew bonded while baking her specialty; the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nAfter a stint in the Air Force, Amos took a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency and began to work his way up.\n\nHe became William Morris’ first African-American talent agent. He would get his foot in the door of potential clients with his home-made chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIt was an effective ploy. Amos’ clients would include Simon & Garfunkel, Marvin Gaye, Helen Reddy.\n\nGaye and Reddy thought so highly of the cookies that they urged Amos to open a store and lent him the money in 1975 to start baking out of a Sunset Blvd storefront in Los Angeles.\n\nIn its first year, Famous Amos Cookies generated $300,000 in revenue. Within six years, there were dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country, boxes of cookies on supermarket shelves and annual revenue of more than $12 million.\n\nWhile the cookies were delicious, the New York Times would report at the time of his passing, the big draw also was Mr. Amos himself.\n\n“An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)”\n\nAmos was relentlessly optimistic and made regular appearances on sitcoms and entertainment shows such as Famous Amos.\n\nAs his fame grew, he made peace with his Tallahassee roots. His childhood memories were of a broken home in a segregated city, but when he returned as Famous Amos, he embraced the city of his birth.\n\n\"For years, I didn't have fond memories of Tallahassee - I grew up during segregation. But when I came back in 1981 to visit, and went back to my old neighborhood, I realized that a big part of who I was came from here. That community. Now I'm proud to be from Tallahassee,\" Amos told the Tallahassee Democrat in 1994.\n\nA fervent advocate for childhood literacy, Amos publicly visited the city to promote reading and other initiatives in 2006, 1995 and 1994.\n\nFinancial troubles forced Wally to sell Famous Amos cookies in 1988, at the time, he didn’t realize he had also sold his name.\n\nStripped of the company he started from scratch and forbidden to use the Famous Amos handle; he moved to Hawaii and became Uncle Noname, the baker of Gourmet Muffins.\n\nAmos also wrote an autobiography, “Man with No Name: Turns Lemons into Lemonade,” detailing how he lost the Famous Amos nickname.\n\nSheriff Phillip Decourcey (1846 - 1875)\n\nPhillip Decourcey, sometimes spelled DeCoursey, was born a slave on a plantation in Jefferson County. After the Civil War, he moved to Tallahassee, where he found work as a blacksmith, teacher and preacher.\n\nHe apparently was well liked, winning election to be the city’s tax assessor in 1873. Two years later DeCourcey was appointed Leon County Sheriff.\n\nAs the county’s leading law man, De Courscey earned praise from white and Black people, but he served only nine months.\n\nHe died in office with his death attributed to pneumonia.\n\nThe Tallahassee Sentinel newspaper wrote: “He was known as one of the most intelligent colored men in this county and during the last term of the circuit court he exhibited convincing evidence of his ability to perform the duties of the sheriff’s office in the most acceptable manner.”\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam ( * - 1967)\n\nMrs. Helen Archer Gilliam managed to keep her age out of numerous newspapers stories in which she appeared during her three decades in Tallahassee. Despite the best of our abilities, her streak remains intact.\n\nThe Camden, N. J., native arrived in the city 1941 and 21 years later was the Junior Woman’s Club nominee for Tallahassee Woman of the Year.\n\nGilliam is remembered as a humanitarian, for the work she provided to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Auxiliary and as a friend for those afflicted with chronic illness.\n\nGilliam organized and trained the city's first class of Candy Stripers, teen age hospital volunteers.\n\nDuring World War II, she was president of the local Chaperone Club, which organized dance nights and raised funds for social clubs for soldiers training at Dale Mabry field.\n\nGilliam was the only lay member of the district board of directors of the American Cancer Society.\n\nShe served as director of volunteers for the Easter Seal Society and ran fundraising campaigns. And she was the region's director of sales for the Christmas Seal campaign to raise money for charitable groups.\n\nAnd, Gilliam organized and was the director of the Tallahassee chapter of Beta Sigma Phil, the international sorority of working woman.\n\nFather James Page (1808 - 1883)\n\nJames Page was born into slavery in Richmond, V.A., brought to a Tallahassee plantation and grew up to become Florida's First African-American Itinerant preacher and the founder of one of Tallahassee’s most influential churches.\n\nPage was raised on the Bel Air plantation, south of town. There he met Elizabeth, a fellow slave. They married and Bel Air would be their permanent home.\n\nPlantation owner John Parkhill owned Bel Air, Page and Elizabeth. Page became Parkhill's chief assistant.\n\nParkhill was an elder in the Presbyterian Church, who provided religious instruction to Page. At the time, the Presbyterian Church did not admit Black congregants. Nonetheless, Page would plant the seeds that would become the missionary Baptist church in Florida.\n\nIn 1850, he started a ministry at Bel Air and led the enslaved community to organize the first known Baptist African-descendent congregation in Florida, and the origin of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nParkhill supported Page’s missionary. He donated land on Belaire Road for the church, raised funds among other slaveowners to build the church. He also provided Page the freedom and documents to travel throughout middle Florida to preach the gospel.\n\nWhen he died in 1859, Page was designated business manager and confidant for Parkhill’s widow.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Page became one of the most influential and respected religious leaders of the day.\n\nHe advocated for Black self-determination and independence through ownership of land and political participation. Page traveled throughout the South, converting hundreds of thousands to the Baptist faith.\n\nIn 1868, he built a school at Bel Air called the Page School Society, which was one of the first schools for African-Americans in Florida.\n\nIn 1879, Page helped African-American Bethlehem Baptist Association #1 establish a African-American Baptist school in Live Oak that was the forerunner of the present Florida Memorial College located in Miami.\n\nPage remained an active preacher into the final week of his life. The Weekly Floridian reported that he died “quietly and peacefully” at his home.\n\nPage is buried in Tallahassee’ Old City Cemetery, across Call Street from the church he founded as a ministry to enslaved workers.\n\nIn 2024, a historical marker honoring Father James Page was erected in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. (1884 - 1970)\n\nGuyte Pierce McCord Sr. was one of the most influential city fathers at the turn of the 20th century and for some reason a park dedicated to his memory features a giant bronze sculpture of a Komodo dragon.\n\nHe wrote the city charter approved by the Florida Legislature in 1919. He also was the last mayor of the old system (1919), first mayor of the new system (1920-1922), city attorney from 1927 to 1936, and clerk of the Florida Supreme Court from 1938 to 1964.\n\nTallahassee saluted McCord in 1970 and named a park with canopy trails in his honor. It's at the southeast corner of the intersection of Thomasville and Armistead Roads.\n\nWhen a shopping center and gas station was proposed for the six-acre site in 1965, McCord led the opposition and spoke at a hotly contested zoning meeting.\n\n“You ought to put an end to this. This property ought to be bought for a city park,” he told the commission he once led.\n\n“There should not be further business along Thomasville Highway with more filling stations and sandwich stands. We are spending millions to make the Capitol Center beautiful but spending nothing for parks,” said McCord.\n\nThe Guyte P. McCord Park, features green spaces, a flowerly walking path, and a canopied walking path encircling a pond that attracts various bird species. Throughout the park are seven bronze sculptures of children and dogs at play and a giant Komodo dragon by Sandy Proctor. It is unclear why Proctor included the dragon in the McCord collection, but it is regarded today as one of the park's treasures.\n\nFrederick S. Humphries (1935 - 2021)\n\nFred Humphries was born in Apalachicola on Dec. 26, 1935, grew up in the segregated South and was inspired by a high school math teacher “to do better.”\n\nHumphries became a champion of education, especially for disadvantaged young people.\n\nHe graduated with honors from FAMU in 1957, with a degree in chemistry, then earned his master’s and doctorate degrees in physical chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. He was Pitt’s first African-American Ph.D. in chemistry. Humphries taught at Minnesota but returned to FAMU as a chemistry professor in 1968. He left to become president of Tennessee State University in 1974, overseeing that HBCU’s merger with the predominantly white UT-Nashville campus — the nation’s first successful merger of two such institutions, with TSU maintaining its administrative autonomy. Humphries became FAMU’s eighth president in 1985 and set the university on a path of unprecedented growth and national acclaim.\n\nThe Humphries’ years, 1985-2001, saw FAMU enrollment and national standing boosted by Humphries' unorthodox recruitment of scholars and donors and pursuit of academic grants.\n\nHumphries would approach young people on the streets of Europe and Africa touting the FAMU brand.\n\nHumphries was a Rattler from the moment he saw the Marching 100 perform at halftime of a game he saw as a high school student on a field trip.\n\nA student chemistry professor Fred Humphries recruited would later be a FAMU president. Larry Robinson (2017 –2024) eulogized Humphries as “a visionary, whose brilliance was on constant display.”\n\nThe number of National Achievement Scholars President Humphries enticed to enroll at FAMU recruited led the nation, outpacing Harvard, Yale, and Stanford in 1992, 95, 97 and tying Harvard in 2000.\n\nThe school’s enrollment increased from 5,100 when Humphries was hired to nearly 12,000 by the time he retired and included 657 National Achievement Scholars.\n\nThe amount of annual grant money the school secured increased during his tenure from $8 million to $62 million.\n\nAnd in 2000, with Humphries as president, the Florida Board of Regents restored the FAMU law school, closed in 1968, with a campus in Orlando.\n\nRuby Diamond (1886 - 1982) and Smiley Bruce (1919 - 2002)\n\nRuby Diamond was one of 13 members of the Florida State College’s 1905 graduating class and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry.\n\nMiss Ruby, as she preferred to be called, once deadpanned that she \"wasn't taught to do a blessed thing on earth but smile.”\n\nHowever, Diamond had a reputation as a shrewd businesswoman. And it appears her passion was to give away her wealth.\n\nRuby’s father, Julius Diamond, was a wealthy Tallahassee merchant.\n\nWhen Julius died, Ruby inherited a large fortune. She sold the family business and home and moved into the Floridian Hotel, where she assembled a collection of antique snuff bottles shipped in from all over the world.\n\nDiamond is representative of a class of wealthy, single, 19th century progressive women philanthropists. Columbia University philosopher John Dewey, a spokesman for that era of progressives and creator of the Dewey Decimal System, was a friend who visited and corresponded with Diamond.\n\nShe never married. The city became her family. Tallahasseans would often see Ruby Diamond taking drives around the city in a 1963 powder-blue Cadillac, chauffeured by Smiley Bruce, a former custodian for the state, bus driver and ice man.\n\nShe and Bruce were inseparable in his 25 years chaufering Miss Ruby. His recollection of their relationship informs E. Lynne Wright’s novel “It Happened in Florida: Remarkable Events That Shaped History.\" Others drew comparisons of Diamond and Bruce to the 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy,” a story about another single, elderly, eccentric, Jewish woman.\n\nMiss Ruby fought for lower taxes and racial equality, helped establish Temple Israel, and founded the “Diamond Vegetable Basket,” to provide seeds and fertilizer to any Leon County resident who received welfare assistance.\n\n“At Christmastime she sent me out to get people who didn’t have any place to go and had me collect them up and carry them to different cafes,\" Bruce told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nShe always picked up the bill.\n\nRuby Diamond established scholarships at FSU for disadvantaged students and contributed to at least 37 charitable organizations. She was an active member of the Oleander Garden Circle, Tallahassee Historical Society, LeMoyne Art Foundation, and the Tallahassee Junior Museum.\n\nIn 1970 FSU named its largest auditorium in her honor, housed in the iconic Westcott Building.\n\nA year later, Diamond donated property valued at $100,000 to the university. And in 1981, she donated more property to help fund an endowed chair of national excellence in the College of Education.\n\nDiamond died in 1982, bequeathing to Smiley that blue Cadillac. The church leader at Friendship Primitive Baptist Church and foster grandparent then turned his hand to selling boiled peanuts in his retirement.\n\n\"He always liked to do something,\" said his grandaughter Regina Webster. \"He never could stay still. He liked to be around people. He loved to talk.\n\nRobert Butler (1786 - 1860)\n\nRobert Butler was an American military officer, a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans raised by Andrew Jackson after Butler’s parents died of yellow fever.\n\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the U.S., Butler represented the U.S. at ceremonies in St. Augustine where Spanish Gov. Jose Maria Coppinger handed over possession of the city and territory and left for Cuba.\n\nIn 1824, when Tallahassee was founded and a crew of Jackson’s former officers were seemingly in charge of affairs, Butler was appointed the Survey General of Florida.\n\nHis first job was to establish the prime meridian, which serves as ground zero for all real estate transactions – the reference point for all surveys of property deeds in the state.\n\nInterim Gov. George Walton selected a spot about 200 yards south and east of the Capitol. Walton drove a cedar stake in the ground, next to the ampitheater at today's Cascades Park, and Butler would approve and certify all land surveys in the state until 1848 using the stake as the prime meridian.\n\nButler was a Jackson man. He organized Tallahassee’s first fraternal organization, the Masonic Jackson Lodge.\n\nHe married Jackson's daughter Rachel Hays, and gave Lake Jackson its name. Butler and Hays had a 900-acre plantation that extended from its shore and included the mounds built by Native Americans.\n\nNearby he built a holding pond to power a mill.\n\nWaist high tombstones for Robert and Rachel are located off Crowder Road near Lake Jackson Mounds State Park. They are off of the right fork of the park’s Butler Mill Trail, where a keen eye can spot remnants of the mill project.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown (1785 - 1867)\n\nThomas Brown the pioneer – not Tom Brown, the namesake of Tallahassee’s premier city park – was among a group of War of 1812 veterans who later settled in Tallahassee once it was named the Florida capital.\n\nBefore he moved to town, Brown, as the chief clerk of the Richmond, Va., post office, invented the post office letter box.\n\nIn 1828 Tallahassee, Brown built a hotel on Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets, south of the present-day state Capitol campus. Originally called Brown’s Inn, the hotel underwent many name changes, including being called City Hotel for a couple of years.\n\nThe hotel provided the connections that enabled Brown to remain politically active. He served as president of the legislative council in 1838, was a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and served in the first session of the Florida House of Representatives in 1845.\n\nIn 1849, Brown became the only Whig Party member elected Florida governor. He promoted agriculture and worked to improve the transportation and education systems.\n\nIntrigued by the rich soil in the Lake Okeechobee watershed, he explored whether to drain the Everglades to create more farmland. The initiative resulted in Fort Myers emerging as a bustling village.\n\nHe persuaded the legislature to endorse building a plank toll road from Jacksonville to Lake City. Under his tenure, a steamship line was initiated on the St. Johns River. And in 1853, the East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala. Closed by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would become the University of Florida.\n\nAt the end of his term as governor, Brown retired from public life. A Mason for more than 60 years, he served as the long-term secretary for the Tallahassee lodge and compiled a book on Masonry.\n\nGov. Thomas Brown is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.\n\nRev. Herbert Clarke Alexander (1929 - 1994)\n\nHerbert C. Alexander was a transitional figure who straddled two eras; between those who tried to work through Jim Crow and those who fought it.\n\nAlexander was a high school dropout from Palatka who joined the U.S. Army and then earned a degree in religion from Florida A&M University in 1957.\n\nHe would teach five years at Bond Elementary, and then at the old Lincoln High before leaving Tallahassee for the University of Tennessee where he would earn a Ph.D.\n\nAlexander would return to Tallahassee as FAMU’s Vice President of Student Affairs in 1969.\n\nIt was a turbulent time with the anti-war and Civil Rights movements flourishing and universities and the city struggling to meet student’s demands.\n\n“Herbert was never at the forefront of activism. But he was a man of impeccable character, who certainly always espoused the goals of the Civil Rights movement,” said the late Charles Smith, FAMU’s then Dean of Graduate Studies at Alexander’s passing.\n\nSmith participated in many of the marches and demonstrations students organized.\n\nAlexander was also a preacher, who ministered at Baptist churches in Valdosta, Quitman, and Tallahassee, where he followed his mentor, the Rev. C.K. Steele as pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church..\n\nYet although Steele was a driving force in the 1956 Bus Boycott, Alexander’s conciliatory nature in the VP role did not always mesh well with the demands of 1970s-era students.\n\nHe said he grew weary in the job and stepped down in 1972.\n\n“I have great faith in young people. I see in them the energy, enthusiasm, that I feel I am losing,” Alexander told the Associated Press.\n\n“If the powers that be will not be unduly restrictive on them, they will find solutions to almost all kinds of problems we struggle with,” said Alexander.\n\nAlexander remained on the FAMU campus as the director of the business ethics program. In that role, his relentless positive voice about the nature of man became a magnet for students. They would line up outside his office to talk and seek advice.\n\n“He didn’t have the talent to turn them away,” said then Dean Sybil Mobley.\n\nAlexander was a recipient of the FAMU Distinguished Alumni Award in Religion and the Martin L. King Jr. Leadership Award.\n\nRob Roy Ashmore (1916 - 2010)\n\nRob Roy Ashmore held court for more than 60 years in a store that evolved into Ashmore Antique’s. Once a drug store, the place became a junktique emporium/pecan shop on West Brevard Street in Frenchtown, across from the Old Lincoln High and just down the street from the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nThe eclectic store with an eccentric owner became a landmark for generations of college students and politicians.\n\nWhen he passed, longtime social services lobbyist Jack Levine wrote of Ashmore, “no one knew more Florida governors more personally than Rob Roy.”\n\nThe reason governors made their way to his store, Ashmore told Levine was, “because I’m famous. I can’t say the same for some of them.”\n\nAshmore Antiques came to be after World War II when Rob Roy took over his cousin’s store.\n\nHe stocked it with funky junk, retro furniture, and abstract odds and ends, and bought pecans from teens and the homeless to sell.\n\nCollege students flocked to the store where the proprietor seemed more interested in spinning tall and small tales than he was in selling anything.\n\nCandidates would ask to put their posters in his window and after the election instead of trashing them, Ashmore used them to paper the store’s walls.\n\nThe place became an improv political museum, decorated with more than 200 posters and framed photographs of a who’s who of politicians from former President Harry Truman to former Mayor John Marks.\n\nAfter the store’s popularity attracted England’s Duke of Windsor in 1952, it became a campaign stop for candidates. In 1968 presidential candidates Hubert Humphrey, Shirley Chisholm and George Wallace visited and snacked on pecans with Rob Roy.\n\nAshmore once spent an afternoon drinking Coca-Cola and munching on fresh-shelled pecans with Gov. Claude Kirk. Kirk persuaded Ashmore to help move his daughter out of an FSU dorm room. A laborer Ashmore brought along asked why he kept calling the other man \"governor.\" The worker did not recognize Kirk, which delighted Ashmore.\n\nAshmore's tales also included cruising around town with Gov. LeRoy Collins in the governor’s limousine and supplying Gov. Lawton Chiles with tobacco snuff for hunting.\n\n“I’m not supposed to tell you because he took on big tobaccy – but he liked to pinch it when he was out shooting birds,” Ashmore said.\n\nA Sopchoppy native, Ashmore credited a lesson he learned working for at an uncle’s Jackson County drug store for his store becoming a Tallahassee landmark.\n\n“I learned quick that being nice back was good for business,” Ashmore said.\n\nAshmore closed his store in 2008. The city has purchased the building with the intent of turning it into a local cultural center and African American museum.\n\nThomas Irwin Brown Jr. (1914 - 1973)\n\nThomas Irwin Brown, no relation to the Floirda Gov. Brown, was a coach, athletic director and longtime county commissioner.\n\nA Pulaski County Georgia native, Brown played football at Clemson. In 1944, he was hired to coach the Leon High School football team. Brown also operated a laundry business, service station and built an apartment complex near Florida State University.\n\nGov. LeRoy Collins appointed Brown to the Leon County Board of County Commissioners in 1958 following the death of Commissioner William Kelley.\n\nHe would serve 14 years, being reelected three times.\n\nAs a politician, Brown followed a conservative philosophy that supported consolidation of city and county governments, expansion of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, construction of the truck route that became Capital Circle, a county library, and an addition to the courthouse.\n\nHe served as the Commission’s chair 1963-1964, 1967-1968, and 1972.\n\nBrown also served as president of the Tallahassee Kiwanis Club and director of the Tallahassee Booster and Quarterback clubs. He coached a Babe Ruth League baseball team for 20 years.\n\nIn 1977, the City of Tallahassee dedicated a 255-acre recreation park in Tom Brown’s memory. As a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nBrown died in 1973, and is buried at Roselawn Cemetery.\n\nEdward Bradford (1798 - 1871)\n\nEdward and brothers Thomas, William, Henry, and Richard arrived in Tallahassee from Enfield, North Carolina, in 1829. Direct descendants of William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, and English statesman Oliver Cromwell, the brothers would establish five plantations along what is now Thomasville Road in north Leon County.\n\nTallahassee’s northeast suburbs were once the site of a Bradford agricultural enterprise powered by the labor of enslaved individuals at Edgewood, Horseshoe, Pine Hill, Walnut Hill, and Water Oak plantations.\n\nRecords of transactions with New York cotton brokers between 1840 and 1866 indicate it was a prosperous business worth millions in today's money.\n\nThe Leon County 1860 Agricultural Census found 130 slaves worked Pine Hills and assessed the plantation’s value at $949,510 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Census, the brothers held 585 people as enslaved workers.\n\nA book titled \"Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida, 1821–1860\" noted that the Bradfords held a large barbecue for its enslaved workers on July 4th and that Christmas week was a time of no work except for tending livestock. Bradford's wife would commission gifts for the \"black folks\" including shawls, brightly colored printed dresses and bandannas, new hats and Sunday shoes, according to the author. It was a different scene at the nearby Chemonie plantation where there was no celebration.\n\nEdward's nephew Capt. Richard H. Bradford was the first soldier killed in Florida in the Civil War.\n\nEdward also owned the Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. When he died in 1871, Horseshoe became known as Bradfordville, which is today an unincorporated village of 19,000.\n\nDale Mabry (1891 - 1992)\n\nDale Mabry is a Florida name most people associate with a Tampa-area highway but Dale Mabry the man was a Tallahassee native, and his hometown didn’t appreciate when Tampa appropriated his name.\n\nMabry was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett.\n\nOn February 21, 1922, Captain Dale Mabry lost his life at age 30 when the rudder system malfunctioned on the 410 foot long airship \"Roma\" that he was piloting over Norfolk, Va.\n\nFrom a height of 1,000 feet, the Roma with 43 people onboard, went into a dive straight to the ground.\n\nJust before the airship impacted the ground, it encountered power lines that caused the vessel to burst into flames.\n\nMabry and 34 airmen died in the accident, which at the time was the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Mabry’s body was removed from the twisted and burnt wreckage he was still holding the wheel to steer the airship.\n\nThe US Army would never use hydrogen in any of its airships again.\n\nIn 1929, Tallahassee named its first airfield in his honor. Dale Mabry Field was dedicated on November 11, Veteran’s Day.\n\nA few years later, Tampa wanted to name its airfield after Mabry, but Tallahassee would not agree to change the name of its airfield. Tampa officials finally decided to just name a new road leading to the airfield after Mabry.\n\nMabry will one day have his Tallahassee moment again with the opening of the Dale Mabry Army Airfield Museum on the campus of Tallahassee State College.\n\nHelen Grissett (1916 - 2016)\n\nHelen Turner Grissett was a long-time educator whose love for animals made her a legendary director of what once was the Tallahassee Junior Museum, and today is the Tallahassee Museum – 52 acres of historical buildings and exhibits of animals and natural Florida.\n\nGrissett received a B.A. from Florida State College for Women in 1940 and a M.A. from the University of Florida in 1950. She taught at Caroline Brevard Elementary for two years, at Leon High for five, and Ruediger Elementary for a decade.\n\nIn 1964, she was appointed director of the fledgling Junior Museum and helped make into reality what psychology professor Howard Baker called at Grissett’s retirement in 1971, “the best idea from Tallahassee in our generation.”\n\nGrissett loved animals. Her idea of a mini zoo of petable animals became the Museum’s most popular feature.\n\nToday, the Museum is home to red wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, red and grey fox, the Florida panther, bobcats, and cougars, along with many birds, and reptiles.\n\nGrissett was the last director to live on site, which made her view her park responsibilities as a 24-hour job.\n\nWhen a veterinarian had given up on a fox and said it would not survive, Grissett stayed up all night and nursed it. The fox lived.\n\nOne time Grissett took a baby goat, another time, a baby fawn to bed with her when they were sick to keep them warm while they recovered. And she used her bathtub as a hospital bed for alligators.\n\nThe Tallahassee Junior Museum held a Helen Grissett Day, June 13, 1971, when Grissett retired. A plaque on the Museum’s early childhood education building recognizes Grissett’s contribution to the Museum.\n\nMrs. Jessie Moon (1904 - 1982)\n\nMarion County’s Jessie Moon may be Leon County school systems' most successful innovator.\n\nJesse Moon earned a degree from Florida State College for Women in 1934 and taught at Kate Sullivan and Hartsfield elementary schools before being named the first principal of W.T. Moore Elementary School.\n\nThe school opened in the fall of 1968 as the county’s first truly integrated school.\n\nStudents still living in the footprint of old plantations where the families had been for generations and neighborhoods built by a nascent “Sun Belt” economic boom, were blended into one student body.\n\n“This was a relatively new concept at the time, but the school made great advances,” said DJ Wright, who joined the faculty in 1974.\n\nMoon wanted her teachers to know their students and each summer loaded them on a bus and drove through the areas where students lived – providing a visual display of a diverse student population.\n\nAnd she wanted students to understand each other. They would participate in daily discussions of their similarities and differences; even learning how each other's hair felt to the touch.\n\nMoon pioneered the open classroom concept for Leon County. The idea employed team teaching techniques. Classrooms consisted of seven large learning centers and two rooms for specialized instruction.\n\nAnd Moon also developed a hearing-impaired program that initially served seven counties. Students were bused from 50 miles away.\n\n“She was ahead of her times,” said Roberta Trowbridge, a student teacher for the program, who would spend all but one year of her career at Moore.\n\n“Mrs. Moon would come visit in our classroom and interact with the children regularly. She had such compassion for these kids,” said Trowbridge.\n\nAway from school, Mrs. Moon was a gardener who made bouquets of flowers for teachers, students, and parents.\n\nToday they are remembered as floral displays of the warm, inviting, positive school culture Moon created at Moore.\n\n“You felt it when you went through the doors. She knew she was creating an institution of learning for children, and it has lived on as a testament to her,” said Wright, who served as Moore’s principal 1994 - 2003.\n\nIn 1980, an addition previously identified as the Hearing Impairment Program’s Center M, was dedicated in honor of Mrs. Jessie Moon.\n\nRichard A. Shine (1810 -1862)\n\nTwenty-year old Richard A. Shine arrived in Tallahassee in 1830 and left a mark on the capital city that remains visible today. They include some notable tourist attractions .\n\nShine was a builder and supervised construction of the 1845 state Capitol, known today as the Historic Old Capitol. Other projects include the First Presbyterian Church, the Bloxham House at 410 Calhoun St., the Chittenden House at 323 Park Ave, and the main house of Goodwood Museum and Gardens.\n\nAccording to Census information from 1840, Shine was listed as the owner of 30 slaves. Historian Andrew Frank said Shine was known to have used slaves on his projects in Tallahassee and also hired them out as skilled laborers.\n\nThe bricks for the construction projects were made at a 50-acre brickyard located between Mahan Drive and Miccosukee Road that Shine owned. Remnants of the kilns were visible as late as 1934, according to the Tallahassee Historical Society Annual.\n\nBut he was also an engineer who made the deep cut along Mahan and under Magnolia Drive to lay the tracks that brought the Pensacola-Georgia Railroad to east Tallahassee in 1857. That cut, dug by enslaved people, is still in use today.\n\nA Quartermaster General of the Confederate army and Florida Militia, died in 1862, at the height of the Civil War. No written account of his death has been found. The Shine family tomb is in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nSeeking clues: Help solve mystery of two portraits found at Goodwood Museum\n\nMarion Franklin Tinsley (1927 - 1995)\n\nMarion F. Tinsley was so good at checkers that he ran out of human opponents. The Florida A&M and Florida State math professor spent the last five years of his life beating increasingly more powerful computers.\n\nTinsley earned a doctorate at The Ohio State University in 1957 and then taught math at FAMU for 26 years and 10 years at FSU. He also served as a part-time minister at Tallahassee Christian Church.\n\nTinsley won the world checkers championship in 1954 and today is recognized as the greatest checker player ever.\n\nHe was world champion from 1954 – 1958, and again from 1975 – 1991. He also claimed four consecutive Florida Open championships, 1974, 75, 76, 77.\n\nHe claimed he was a mediocre checkers player until at age 14 when he stumbled on a book of checkers while researching a math problem at the library.\n\n“Checkers can get quite a hold on you. Its beauty is just overwhelming, the mathematics, the elegance, the precision. It’s capable of wrapping you all up,” said Tinsley, according to a New York Times obituary.\n\nTwo of the seven games Tinsley lost during a 50-year run were to a Chinook computer program. It had a repertory of 250 billion moves and could make 3 million calculations a minute. It beat Tinsley once when he was intoxicated, and again during an exhibition when Tinsley competed in two matches at once.\n\nBefore cancer forced Tinsley to retire from competition, he fought the computer to six straight draws.\n\n“Tinsley was the Mount Everest we wanted to scale,” said program developer Jonathan Schaeffer after Tinsley withdrew from the 1994 world championship competition.\n\nBurt Norton (1943 - 1995)\n\nIt was 1966, about the time the Beatles released the landmark Revolver album, when Burt Norton drove into Tallahassee. He arrived in a Ford station wagon loaded with a 1960 Fender Jazzmaster, a Fender Pro Amp, a stand alone Fender reverb tank, and a few clothes.\n\nThirty years later when Tallahassee music community gathered for a memorial concert in his honor, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote, “no doubt there would have been a music scene in Tallahassee without Burt Norton. But just as certainly it would have been entirely different.”\n\nBurt Norton was the man behind Norton Audio and Music on Jackson Bluff Road. Tallahassee’s first rock n roll music store. It stocked the name brands that powered the Woodstock Generation. It became known as Norton Music, “The Guitar Store;” a mecca for musicians and fans.\n\nNorton provided services for his products, never charged for guitar string installations or setups.\n\n“It was just a given, Burt was always there,” recalled John Paul Waters before the 1995 tribute concert for Norton. “He didn’t make a big deal about it. Whatever you were looking for in the music world, he was a great resource.”\n\nPeople poured into the store – students, musicians, transients – to share stories and talk music.\n\n“I always found it interesting how I could wait on a farmer early in the morning and a state supreme court justice toward closing time,” recalled Ken Norton, who worked the counter at his brother’s store.\n\nEventually Norton decided Tallahassee needed a recording studio. So, he went off to Nashville and toured the studios where Roy Orbison recorded.\n\nHe opened a 16-track recording studio at the Jackson Bluff location.\n\nFor the next 10 years, Sweet Bay studios recorded dozens of local groups. Among those who cut songs or albums at Sweet Bay were LaBamba/Flipside, Meisburg and Walters, Bill Wharton, Drew Reid, BB Jam, Dixie Drive, Rainbow Band, Tallahassee Band, McKenzie Brothers – and a teenage country singer from Quincy, Billy Dean.\n\nIn 1986, amid growing competition from other music stores, Norton closed the store and took a job with the state. He passed away in January 1995 at age 52.\n\nLaura Mae Thompson Dixie (1925 - 2017)\n\nLaura Mae Thompson hailed from the Chaires neighborhood east of town and became a key organizer in the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee.\n\n“The Mother of the Movement in Tallahassee,” is how Bethel Missionary Baptist Rev. R.B. Holmes eulogized Dixie.\n\nDixie was an activist. Served as vice president of the Leon County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Was a board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and president of AFSCME Local 2847.\n\nVisiting people who were sick, taking in first-generation Florida A&M students, and feeding people were the foundations of Dixie’s approach to community organizing.\n\nDixie didn’t like speaking in front of crowds and avoided the spotlight. She was the person that others depended on when funds needed to be raised, voters needed to be registered, or when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., needed a place to stay during a Tallahassee stop.\n\nDixie was persistent. When the pace of desegregation at W.T. Edward Hospital proved to be slow, she quietly went to work.\n\n\"I had a long fingernail file and they had these signs also where, you know, they had the patients segregated,\" she recalled in a recorded interview.\n\n\"They had a white wing, black wing, white bathroom, colored bathroom, white eating dining room, colored dining room, and so I took my fingernail file and went 'round and unscrewed every one of those segregation signs off the door ... the supervisor said, 'I can't picture nobody doing that but Dixie,' but they still couldn't prove that I did it. I was acting just as innocent as I could be.\"\n\nCharles Saxon Ausley (1907 - 1972)\n\nThere were some impressive shoes Charles Saxon Ausley had to fill. Tallahassee appreciated the work of his dad, the physician Charles, so much they named Ausley Road on the west side in his honor. And his grandfather George Saxon was the founder of the Capital City Bank, the city’s oldest operating business.\n\nCharlie, who carried both men’s names, set out to be, in the words of the Tallahassee Democrat, a “good citizen.”\n\nHe left his mark on the community. In 1930, he teamed with future Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins to create the Ausley McMullen law firm, one of Tallahassee’s oldest law firms.\n\nAusley wrote the first charter of the Florida State Foundation, founded the Tallahassee Jaycees, served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, and as corporate officer of the Tallahassee Democrat and director of the Orange Bowl committee.\n\nCharlie also was a municipal judge, city commissioner, and state senator – filling in for Collins when he resigned to join the Navy during World War II.\n\nWhen he died, a Tallahassee Democrat editorial acknowledged he served as the newspaper’s legal counsel but also extolled him as a “good citizen.”\n\nWrote the editorial board, “In the 42 years since he returned to Tallahassee with his law degree from the University of Florida, there was hardly a worthwhile project or mission on which his help was not sought and given without hesitation. It is such good citizens as Charlie Ausley who have made Tallahassee the place for the good life it is.”\n\nGene Calvin Cox (1935 - 2009)\n\nGene Calvin Cox is the winningest football coach ever to walk a Tallahassee sideline.\n\nIn a 27-year run as head football coach at Leon High School, the Lions were 238 – 67 and won two state championships, 14 district championships, seven regional championships and eight conference championships.\n\nMore than 100 players would sign a college scholarship.\n\nA Lake City native, Cox played at Columbiana High, and was listed behind Lee Corso on the running back depth chart for the 1954 Florida State University team, which won the Sun Bowl.\n\nAfter coaching at high schools in Jefferson and Suwannee counties, Cox became head coach at Leon and a football legend.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions ran off 25 straight wins in 1968, 1969, and 1970. On two other occasions, Leon won sixteen straight games. And in 1984 –1985 the Lions posted a 19-game winning streak.\n\n“He was so serious about and so intense that when you came to college at FSU, that it was really easier than what we were used to at Leon – the intensity of the workout and at practice. And you knew how to win,” said former FSU quarterback Wally Woodham.\n\nUnder Cox, the Leon Lions became a feeder program for Bobby Bowden’s teams at FSU.\n\nThe 1979 11 – 0 Seminoles featured seven Lions, including two quarterbacks, Woodham and Jimmy Jordan, along with QB coach Billy Sexton. The Lion-led Noles only loss was to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl.\n\nCox retired from Leon in 1990 but would return to the sidelines for Aucilla Christian Academy a year later. When he successfully retired as coach after the 1995 season, his 313 wins were the most ever in Florida.\n\nIn 1997, the Tallahassee Sports Commission, the Leon County School Board and the Leon County Commission renamed Capital Stadium to Gene Cox Stadium.\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam (1926 - 2006)\n\nHelen Patsy Gilliam dance students started performing revues at halftime of Leon High School football games in 1947. A New York trained ballet instructor, Gilliam had a studio in the Randall-Lewis House where students from age 2-and-a-half to 16 learned tap and ballet.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, troupes of Gilliam students publicly performed in dance reviews to popular songs. Gilliam outfitted dancers in calico dresses and bonnets for a “Gal in Calico” performance, and in Spanish-theme costumes for \"The Lady in Red.”\n\nBefore Tallahassee desegregated Gilliam opened her studio to Black girls for ballet lessons.\n\nCarla Richardson joined the classes in 1964 and said she and about a half dozen other girls were not fully aware of the controversy Gilliam created by agreeing to enroll them.\n\nIt was a bold stance. Gilliam lost a lot of her white students, and ultimately her downtown studio.\n\nLooking back, Richardson said she and her classmates were unaware of the controversy Gilliam provoked by welcoming them into her studio. They were younger than 10 at the time and would learn more about race relations when the city integrated public schools.\n\n“I just think we didn’t realize at the time this woman was a civil rights activist. She was phenomenal. A single woman who risked her business to teach African American girls,” said Richardson.\n\nOne of those girls was Joyce Warner Tobias, Miss Black America 1971.\n\n“Miss Patsy contributed to her winning. Joyce used dance as her talent in the competition,” said Richardson.\n\nGilliam closed her School of Dance in the early 1970s, and worked as the superintendent at Lewis State Bank.\n\nAlexis Roberts McMillian was among the group of little girls who showed up at Gilliam’s studio in 1964.\n\n“I attribute my agility and movement – that is good for a pretty-plus senior citizen – to my ballet lessons,” said McMillian. “I stuck it out through the 11th grade as one of the last students she had until she stopped teaching. Those classes were finally desegregated ... We raise a glass of cheer to Helen Patsy Gilliam.”\n\nAlvan S. Harper (1847 - 1911)\n\nNorristown, Pennsylvania’s Alvan S. Harper studied photography in Philadelphia. A chance meeting with Tallahassee Judge J.T. Bernard at the 1876 Centennial may have led Alvan and Agnes Harper to move to Tallahassee where they set up a studio to take “artistic photographs.”\n\nHarper posed portraits with backdrops in his studio and photographed residences, buildings, farming, hunting, railway activity and political leaders.\n\nHis portfolio includes hundreds of views of late 19th century Tallahassee street scenes, and about 1,300 portraits of men, women, and children taken between 1884 and 1910.\n\nAlvan had a special interest in Tallahassee’s African American community. While Jim Crow was enforced, he portrayed Black people in a way that defied the legal restrictions they faced. The Museum of Florida selection of his photographs has been made into a traveling exhibition, and his quiet contributions to civil rights were recognized by the University of Florida, the NAACP, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\nIn 2017, a “Trolley ride through Alvan S. Harper’s Tallahassee” was held at the Pensacola Museum of History.\n\n\"Some of Harper's best negatives were lost when his studio was torn down in the 1920s,\" according to a state archives report. \"The negatives had been given to a Tallahassee historian who, because they were dirty, left them on a porch where they were mistaken for trash and taken to the dump.\"\n\nAbout 2,000 Harper negatives were found, however, in 1946 in the attic of a house the Harpers owned. The negatives were turned over to the State Library.\n\nAlvan and his wife Agnes never had children. Both are buried in the Old City Cemetery.\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence (1918 - 2013)\n\nFreeman Delano Lawrence was the final principal for segregated Lincoln High School. Lawrence grew up on a farm near Old. St. Augustine Road and Chaires Crossroad. He and his brother would walk the seven miles to attend Lincoln High School as students.\n\nUpon graduation and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Lawrence would teach in Live Oak and Quincy before returning to Tallahassee. In 1957, he was named principal of his alma mater and would keep his students focused on education during the turbulent 1960s. Lawrence encouraged both academic and vocational students to pursue the highest level of education. He was Lincoln’s principal until the school closed in 1967.\n\nDuring his 25 and more years as a principal at “Black” elementary, junior high and high schools, Lawrence advocated and promoted a higher level of service and financial commitment for the education of Black children.\n\nAdditionally, he assumed responsibility for his teachers, encouraging them to pursue graduate degrees and to this end, made promotions into leadership positions in the Leon County School System possible.\n\nMany attributed Lawrence’s ability to create alliances and negotiate helped make Leon County’s transition to integrated schools look effortless while integration elsewhere came under duress and sometimes violence.\n\nAfter integration, Lawrence became principal of the newly created Lincoln-Griffin High School. He later moved on to Nims Middle School, before retiring in 1978,\n\nIn 1996, he received a Florida A&M University’s Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2012 the Tallahassee Urban League bestowed its Legend Award to Freeman D. Lawrence.\n\nHe was remembered in his obituary as \"one of God's best servants.\"\n\n\"I once bought a three-piece suit just so I could look like Mr. Lawrence,\" then Sen. Bill Montford said at his funeral. \"In education, we as a state are always looking for the answer. I would suggest to you, we had the answer at the original Lincoln.\"\n\nMargaret Leonard (1942 - 2022)\n\nJournalism and justice inspired Margaret Leonard.\n\nRaised in Macon and Atlanta by parents who were reporters, Leonard would report for the Chattanooga Times, Miami Herald, and the St. Petersburg Times before she joined the Tallahassee Democrat as a government reporter in the 1980s.\n\nBefore making Tallahassee home, Leonard made history in 1960 as a Tulane University student when she became the “first unmistakably Southern white student\" to join the Freedom Riders to register Black people to vote in Mississippi.\n\nA teenage Leonard was repeatedly arrested as the Freedom Riders registered voters. She was jailed and spent time in the notorious Parchman Prison.\n\nLeonard told an oral history project in 2001 the experience traumatized her and inspired her journalism.\n\n“I wrote a lot about prisons, power stuff,” she said. “That was the question that I was interested in my whole life: What do people do when they have power, and what do you do about it if you don’t have it?”\n\nLeonard was open and frank in discussions with friends. As an editor, her comments were pointed but softened by a lilting Georgia accent.\n\nLate in life, after suffering a brain aneurysm, Leonard carried a dictionary to help her reprogram her brain with words she needed to keep her job.\n\nLeonard had an aversion to the limelight and praise for her work. Before she died, she asked her obituary not to begin with her role as a Freedom Rider.\n\nWhen she passed her family asked in lieu of flowers for contributions to the Equal Justice Initiative.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but we ain’t through,“ Leonard reflected in 2012, in an article recognizing her wor\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadell (1875 - 1963)\n\nThe roots of Tall Timbers, the research station & land conservancy north of Tallahassee, were nourished by a passion for quail hunting.\n\nHenry Ludlow Beadel of Staten Island, New York, first came to Leon County in 1894 with his father to shoot quail, such as the bobwhite, the number one game bird of the South.\n\nHis uncle, Edward, had purchased a 2,200-acre quail hunting plantation known as Hickory Hill that sat on the north shore of Lake Iamonia. Henry would visit every winter and when Edward passed away in 1919, he inherited the property and built a home he named Tall Timbers.\n\nBeadel then devoted much of his time to scientific wildlife research. And in 1926, he began experimenting with controlled burns to study fire's effect on wildlife and plants.\n\nSix years later, he organized the Cooperative Quail Study Association, made up of 21 owners of quail lands in the Tallahassee-Thomasville-Albany area.\n\nAnd in 1958, Beadel founded the Tall Timbers research station with a mission to study game birds, fire and plant ecology, wildlife, and land conservation among other things.\n\nWhen Gov. Farris Bryan presented Beadel with a plague in 1961 to recognize his contributions to wildlife research, the Tallahassee Democrat observed Beadel possessed an “outstanding color motion film libraries on quail and wildlife in the Southeast.”\n\nToday, the Tall Timbers research station holds 158,000 acres in conservation easements.\n\nJames Cullen Lawrence (1932 - 2024)\n\nJames Cullen “J.C.” Lawrence grew up in the Allen subdivision, a neighborhood north of Florida A&M University. The family home was on Canal Street, now part of FAMU Way, where the Anita Favors Lake and Plaza is today.\n\nCherry Lawrence, a younger sister, said the Bronough Street bridge runs right through her childhood bedroom.\n\nJC was known as “Cowboy” while growing up. He starred in basketball at FAMU High, earned a master’s degree in education at FAMU and when he returned after serving in the U.S. Army, he became a role model for the Allen neighborhood kids.\n\nIn 1959, James Cullen Lawrence was named the first Black supervisor over the City of Tallahassee playgrounds and parks. He was put in charge of two recreation centers and the Jake Gaither Golf Course as well.\n\n“It was huge for a Black man to be named manager of a golf course in Tallahassee. That kind of opportunity did not come easy for Black folks,” said Deloris Harpool, who was a teenager and neighbor at the time.\n\n“His appointment was uplifting. It made us feel like we had a chance,” said Harpool.\n\nLawrence was an all-around volunteer. He initiated the first Black Pee Wee Football League of Tallahassee, coordinated the Jake Gaither Alumni Golf Association, and served as treasurer of the Tallahassee branch of the NAACP.\n\nAt the recreational centers, Harpool and Cherry said he “molded the maturity” of a younger generation.\n\nCherry said JC played the role of “a real big brother” for many. He modeled a standard of behavior that demonstrated respect for others. And he expected his young charges to follow his lead when it came to the rules governing playgrounds, rec centers, and golf courses.\n\n“Although he knew us as kids (from Canal St.), he was pretty strict about that. At the dances we attended, skating activities, and basketball games held there, we were all well behaved. He was someone that we really did look up to and we obeyed,” said Cherry.\n\nDelores said JC received the same level of respect given the principal at school.\n\nIn 2002, the previous Dade Street Recreation Center was renamed the Lawrence-Gregory Community Center to honor James C. Lawrence, retired Recreation Superintendent and Beulah Gregory, Supervisor of the Tallahassee Dade Street facility\n\nWilliam May Walker (1905 - 1974)\n\nThe Honorable W. May Walker was a Crawfordville native who practiced law in Tallahassee and became known as the hardest working judge in Florida.\n\nWalker served as a county judge from 1932 to 1940 and then as a Circuit Court judge until his death in 1974.\n\nTallahasseans of his era remember Judge Walker for ending Miami Sen. Lee Weisenborn’s efforts to move the state capital away from Tallahassee.\n\nFor three years, Weisenborn and allies filed challenges to a bond issue to raise the money to build a new state Capitol complex downtown.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs lost an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1968, Walker issued an injunction against any further challenges, telling Weisenborn anymore lawsuits would be “for what purpose I do not know.”\n\nAnother famous case involved a 1959 sexual assault of a FAMU student by four white defendants. At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Walker denied defense counsel’s motion for acquittal and sentenced all four defendants to life at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nAt his passing, former Leon County Judge Charles McClure recalled Walker had a talent to get to the crux of a case. McClure said “it seemed as if he could always come up with the right decision. It was second nature to him, and things would very logically fall into place.”\n\nThe 2nd Judicial Circuit Historical Society records Judge Walker as one of the most distinguished jurists ever to serve the state.\n\nGeorge Langford (1923 - 2019)\n\nGeorge Langford, founder of the Municipal Code Corporation, was the 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. The visionary publisher is also remembered as the father of the Seminole Boosters.\n\nLangford was a World War II veteran and University of Virginia Law graduate. He came to Tallahassee in 1951 with an idea: Codify the regulations of cities and towns, and publish them in books that are called the city codes.\n\nHaving all a city’s ordinances at one’s fingertips in a book turned out to be a hugely successful idea. Langford’s Municipal Code Corporation became a multi-million-dollar enterprise with a 40,000-square-foot printing press near the airport.\n\nThen in the mid-1970s a financial crisis threatened the Florida State University football team. The athletic department was $600,000 in debt and school president Stanley Marshall said if money was not found cuts would be made.\n\nA call was placed to Langford for help. All people can recall is he was “recruited.” In any event, he is credited with resurrecting the Seminole Boosters, which wiped out the debt.\n\nHe would lead the Boosters for three years – a defining moment for FSU athletics that included the hiring of Bobby Bowden as the head football coach.\n\n“The decision to recruit George Langford ... was one of the most important events that has occurred in our 64-year history,” said then Seminole Boosters President Andy Miller when Langford passed.\n\nLangford held a permanent seat on the FSU Foundation Board of Trustees, chaired FSU’s first Capital Campaign, was a founder of Springtime Tallahassee, and involved in dozens of civic organizations.\n\nHe raised money for MaClay School, Tall Timbers, the Monticello Opera House, Springtime Tallahassee, The Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, St. John’s Episcopal Church and St. Peter’s Anglican Church.\n\nThe George and Marian Langford $1 million endowment to FSU’s Department of Classics came about after Langford asked then-president Sandy D'Alemberte which department never had received a financial gift.\n\nLangford was recognized for his unwavering commitment and dedication to FSU in 2000 when the Boosters named a grassy area outside Doak Campbell Stadium where fans and vendors gather The Langford Green.\n\nNic Gavalas (1922 - 2014)\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Nicholas George Gavalas arrived in Tallahassee after World War II and became a founding member of several civic-minded organizations and created the iconic Florida tie.\n\nThe son of a master tailor, Gavalas and his wife Janet opened Nic’s Toggery downtown at Monroe Street and Pensacola Street.\n\nThe store catered to college students and turned into a college hangout. Nic was warm and engaging with customers. He carried the latest fashions. The store quickly joined the ranks of Esquire Magazine’s Top 100 Men’s Store in the United States.\n\n“It was a gathering spot,\" former FSU football player Ron Schomburger, told Tallahassee Democrat’s Gerald Ensley when Gavalas died.\n\n“We’d go in to look at the clothes but have a good conversation with him and his employees. It was like talking to an old friend,” said Schomburger, about Nic.\n\n“To my generation, Nic was a legend,” said ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso, a former Seminole quarterback. “He was like a father figure to me.”\n\nA founding member of Seminole Boosters, Nic designed a Sammy Seminole tie to promote Florida State University athletics.\n\nBut it was his Florida tie that features an outline of the state that became ubiquitous, especially when the Legislature was in town. Former U.S. Senator and Gov. Bob Graham claimed to have worn one for more than 20 years.\n\nNic Gavalas’ legacy continues with Nic’s Toggery, the Official Clothier of the Florida State Seminoles, and with two stores, one downtown and a second one in north Tallahassee.\n\nWilmoth H. and Kathleen Baker (1928 - 2006 and 1929 - 2007)\n\nWhen Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker opened Baker’s Pharmacy in 1958 only one other pharmacy in town would hire a Black pharmacist and there were only certain stores where Black people could shop.\n\nKathleen had a pharmacy degree from Xavier University, and she convinced her husband Wilmoth to pursue one at Florida A&M University where she taught.\n\nThe couple then decide to open a pharmacy in a duplex where Wilmoth’s father had a practice. Sort of a one-stop medical facility for a segregated community.\n\nMoney was tight. When the couple opened their store in August 1958 on South Adams Street, the shelves were stocked with only one of each item – because that was all the Bakers could afford.\n\nWilmoth and Kathleen worked 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to make the pharmacy what former FAMU interim-President Henry Lewis III would call a “beacon of light for this community.”\n\nIt was eclectic. The Bakers sold medicine and almost everything else – from sewing thread to birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nThe counter at their soda fountain drew college students, professionals, the elderly and unemployed. There they swapped news, traded gossip, and sold tickets to social events.\n\nBaker’s Pharmacy was also the internship training ground for nearly 200 FAMU pharmacy students, including Lewis, who would go on to become a Leon County Commissioner, Dean of the College of Pharmacy and a FAMU interim president.\n\nThe pharmacy closed in 2002. Here is an excerpt from a letter to the editor Lewis sent to the Tallahassee Democrat at the time.\n\n“Baker’s Pharmacy was a safe and clean place to take your girlfriend. It was a place where health care was a fundamental right, regardless of your ability to pay. Wilmoth and Kathleen Baker were mother and father away from home for hundreds of FAMU students in their quest for a college degree. The Bakers were a shining example of how a married couple should be and how to raise a family.”\n\nPaul Dirac (1902 - 1984)\n\nPaul Dirac may be the most distinguished Tallahassean ever.\n\nThe 1975 Compton Encyclopedia Yearbook declared him an equal to Sir Isacc Newton and Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein once said about a Dirac paper, “this balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”\n\nDirac won the 1933 Nobel Prize in physics for his Relativistic Wave Equation. He anticipated the string theory in 1962 with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the Dirac membrane.\n\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said Dirac “changed our picture of the universe.”\n\nIt was a twist of fate, and lakes, that made him a Tallahasseean.\n\nDirac held the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University in England – Newton was the first to hold the chair. As Dirac was approaching the mandatory retirement age of 70, FSU offered him a visiting professorship.\n\nIt was 1969. He liked the place. Became a familiar face at seafood restaurants. Would walk to work. Was often spotted swimming at Silver Lake and Lost Lake.\n\nDirac didn’t want to retire so he said goodbye Cambridge, hello Florida. He joined the FSU faculty full time in 1971.\n\n“FSU has a good physics department,” said Dirac when asked why he was here.\n\n“Here I escape the harsh winters of the North. I like swimming in the lakes, rivers, sinkholes and the sea. There are lots of swimming opportunities around Tallahassee. To some extent that is what brought me here.”\n\nDirac received many honors, including the Royal Medal, the Copley Medal, the Max Planck Medal and the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize. He once turned down a knighthood because he did not want to be addressed by his first name but later consented and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973.\n\nPaul Dirac passed away in Tallahassee and was buried at Roselawn Cemetery. His papers are held at the Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University. The street in Innovation Park where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is located is named Paul Dirac Drive in his honor.\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos (1907 - 1977)\n\nEvelyn Kimsey Csikos is the mother of Vo-Tech education in Leon County.\n\nWhen she was named principal of the Lively Continuation School in 1935, the Vienna, Ga., native was one of just two female vocational school directors in the country.\n\nCsikos would travel throughout Florida to construct a bureaucratic infrastructure for vocational education and became a stalwart lobbyist for job training in the Legislature.\n\nCsikos was born in 1907 and moved to Tallahassee eight years later. She graduated from Leon High School in 1926.\n\nShe was one of two teachers hired by Lewis M. Lively in 1931, one of two for 52 students at his school who trained office skills to students not college bound. She taught shorthand and typing.\n\nEvelyn also worked as a stenographer for the Legislature. When she was named director of what would become Lively, World War II was on the horizon and she would change the focus of vocational education.\n\nNorth Florida became a hub of activity for wartime preparation. Aircraft mechanics would join shorthand and accounting in the Lively curriculum, along with the operation of new technology like mimeographing.\n\nCsikos embraced the change and wangled millions of dollars from the federal and state governments to fund vocational and technical education for students not bound for college but wanting skills to earn a living.\n\nUpon her retirement in 1973, Csikos predicted the future of vocational education would be in middle and high schools because she said many college graduates “are learning a college diploma alone won’t get them a job.”\n\nIn retirement, Csikos developed the curriculum for the Pat Thomas Law Enforcement Program.\n\nCsikos died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital while recovering from a heart attack in 1977.\n\nRear Admiral David Betton Macomb (1827 - 1911)\n\nDavid Macomb was the youngest son of David Macomb Sr., and Mary Tiffin Worthington. Mary’s father was the governor of Ohio, and her family opposed the marriage.\n\nThe couple moved to Tallahassee in 1824. They settled along Lake Iamonia, and had five children, David B. the youngest.\n\nThe senior Macomb gained notoriety for a duel with Prince Murat, shooting off Murat’s little finger. He then moved the family to Texas. Tuberculosis claimed Mary and the senior Macomb ended his life by slashing his throat a few months later.\n\nAt age 9, David and his siblings were left orphaned, and raised by family in Ohio.\n\nWhen he was 22, David was appointed a third assistant engineer in the U.S. Navy and explored the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan. When the Civil War broke out, Macomb would be aboard one of the first Union vessels to enter the conflict, and at war’s end he was on the ship that fired the final shots.\n\nHe also distinguished himself as an inventor.\n\nMacomb was the chief engineer of the USS Niagara in April 1861 when it became the first U.S. Navy ship to form up the blockade of Charleston. Niagara would later participate in the bombardment of the Pensacola Naval Yard.\n\nHe returned to Charleston in 1865 aboard the USS Canonicus, which fired the final shot as the rebels retreated to Sullivan’s Island as the South surrendered.\n\nThe Canonicus was then sent in pursuit of a Confederate ironclad, the chase took the Canonicus to Havana where she became the first American ironclad to enter a foreign port.\n\nAmong the inventions Macomb contributed to the U.S. Navy were a hydraulic lift used aboard ironclads, and he made and installed the first fresh-water maker used on a U.S. Navy vessel.\n\nMacomb retired February 27, 1889, with the rank of commodore. He was later promoted to rear admiral.\n\nA street in the Frenchtown neighborhood, and the destroyer the USS Macomb – known as the Mighty Mac by its crew – are named in honor of Rear Admiral Macomb.\n\nDr. Kamal Abdou Yousef, aka King Love (1936 - 1999)\n\nKing Love was someone no one understood but everyone talked about. He reigned in Tallahassee for six years.\n\nKing Love was the creation of Kamal Abdou Youssef. A child prodigy pianist who played for the King of Egypt at the Cairo Opera House in 1949, Yousef graduated from medical school in 1956, moved to New York City in 1969, and then West Palm in 1977.\n\nYoussef, a pathologist, established a successful practice.\n\nPeople say Youssef changed when the first Gulf War started in 1991. He became involved with an anti-war group, was diagnosed with manic depression and then became estranged from his family.\n\nThat’s when King Love came to be, a man with a white beard, a golden crown and a red cape holding a megaphone, and waving signs at intersections around town.\n\nOne would find the King at the corner of Tennessee and Monroe streets during the morning commute and at Apalachee Parkway and Magnolia Street in the afternoon. An electronic megaphone amplified shouts of “Yip, Yip, Yip,\" as he skipped through the crosswalk with signs that promoted love, denounced God, and one adorned with photos of JFK and Princess Diana that encouraged people to “Return to Camelot.”\n\n“I think it was the Gulf War that pushed him over the edge. Before that, he was a normal, very loving person,” his son Anwar told a Tallahassee Democrat reporter who tracked down the family after Yousef’s passing.\n\n“It was like his heart was being torn out. We lost all contact with him after the Gulf War,” said Anwar. “It was all quite sudden.”\n\nKing Love arrived in Tallahassee around 1993 and endeared himself to Tallahasseeans.\n\nTallahassee Police arrested him several times on petty theft, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. Two college students who took him in briefly said Yousef was knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, but could become agitated and erratic.\n\nYousef’s Florida arrest record dates to 1991. A FDLE report listed eight different spellings of his given name and listed his occupation simply as “King.”\n\nHe used his monthly social security checks to publish “love declarations.” They were a mix of brotherhood tinged with paranoia.\n\n“I realize that people have been cheated of real paradise on Earth,” the King told break magazine in 1995. “They have been cheated of their innocence, falsely convicted as sinners and their wages of sin is hell and everlasting fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth. For some, hell is here and now.”\n\nWhen his health began to decline and in his final year, Youseff gave up the King Love persona.\n\nHe shaved his beard, stopped wearing crowns and robes, and quit ranting about politicians. Kamal Abdu Yousef began attending Baptist Celebration Church, which invited an Egyptian priest when it held services for Yousef after he died alone in his apartment.\n\n“I wish to thank the people of Tallahassee from the depth of my heart. People here tolerated him and didn’t harm him. In other societies they would have clobbered him to death. I know it,\" said his brother Nagaui A. Michael, a retired New York City attorney, before the service.\n\n“If I could say one thing to him right now it would be I’m sorry. Because I did not believe in him. Fortunately, the people of Tallahassee did.”\n\nFred Mahan (1886 - 1960)\n\nOn the east side of town where Hillcrest Avenue meets U.S. 90 there’s a 76-year-old marker that designates the highway from Tallahassee to Monticello as Fred Mahan Drive.\n\nFred Mahan was a horticulturist from Dodge City, Kansas, who had a passion for highway beautification.\n\nHe also created the Mahan Pecan, a pecan with a bigger nut and lighter shell, at his Monticello nursery.\n\nIn the 1920s, he would own the second-largest pecan and ornamental shrubs business in the southeast.\n\nCoronet Magazine described him as a “strange philanthropist who bestows beauty instead of dollars\" while \"spreading scenic bounty across the state he loves.”\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, Mahan donated thousands of plants to the county unemployment relief commissions for beautification projects to employ the jobless.\n\nWhen a road company got a contract to remove tree stubs and make other road improvements along U.S. 90 between Tallahassee and Monticello, he contributed thousands of crepe myrtles, camelli", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/04/19/best-lines-from-each-taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-songs/73149212007/", "title": "Best lines from each Taylor Swift 'Tortured Poets Department' songs", "text": "All's fair in love and poetry, but mostly poetry.

This ain't the Chelsea Hotel. We're modern idiots.\"\n\n\"Who's gonna hold you like me? Nobody.\"\n\n\"We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.\"\n\n\"I scratch your head, you fall asleep like a tattooed, golden retriever.\"\n\n\"At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger and put it on the one people put wedding rings on, and that’s the closest I’ve come to my heart exploding.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys'\n\n\"I'm the queen of sand castles he destroys.\"\n\n\"'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night.\"\n\n\"There was a litany of reasons why we could've played for keeps this time. I know I'm just repeating myself. Put me back on my shelf. But first, pull the string.\"\n\n\"Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me.\"\n\n\"I felt more when he played pretend than with all the Kens 'cause he took me out of box, stole my tortured heart, left all these broken parts.\"\n\n'Down Bad'\n\n\"Did you really beam me up? In a cloud of sparkling dust, just to do experiments on, tell me I was the chosen one, show me that this world is bigger than us, then sent me back where I came from?\"\n\n\"For a moment I knew cosmic love, now I'm down bad crying at the gym. Everything comes out teenage petulance.\"\n\n\"Did you take home my old clothes? Just to leave me here naked and alone, in a field in my same old town, that somehow seems so hollow now?\"\n\n\"I'll build you a fort on some planet where they can all understand it. How dare you think it's romantic leaving me safe and stranded.\"\n\n'So Long, London'\n\n\"I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift, pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away. My spine split from carrying us up the hill, wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill.\"\n\n\"I didn't opt in to be your odd man out. I founded the club she's heard great things about.\"\n\n\"I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use. The spirit was gone, we will never come to. And I'm p***ed off you let me give you all that youth for free.\"\n\n\"For so long London, stitches undone, two graves, one gun, I’ll find someone.\"\n\n\"You swore that you loved me but where were the clues? I died on the alter waiting for the proof.\"\n\n\"And I’m just getting color back into my face. I’m just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place.\"\n\n'But Daddy I Love Him'\n\n\"Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best. Clutching their pearls, sighing, 'What a mess.' I just learned these people try and save you 'cause they hate you.\"\n\n\"I’m telling him to floor it through the fences. No, I’m not coming to my senses. I know it’s crazy but he’s the one I want.\"\n\n\"He was chaos, he was revelry. Bedroom eyes like a remedy.\"\n\n\"'Stay away from her,' the saboteurs protested too much. Lord knows the words we never heard, just screeching tires and true love.\"\n\n\"I’ll tell you something about my good name, it’s mine alone to disgrace. I don’t cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing.\"\n\n\"God save the most judgmental creeps who say they want what’s best for me, sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I’ll never see.\"\n\n\"If all you want is gray for me, then it’s just white noise, and it’s just my choice.\"\n\n'Fresh Out the Slammer'\n\n\"Rollin' thunder, he don't understand me. Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter. He was with her in dreams.\"\n\n\"Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge.\"\n\n\"All those nights you kept me going, swirled you into all of my poems. Now we're at the starting line, I did my time.\"\n\n\"Ain’t no way I’m gonna screw up, now that I know what’s at stake here.\"\n\n'Florida!!!' (ft. Florence + The Machine)\n\n\"And this city reeks of driving myself crazy.\"\n\n\"Little did you know, your home's really only a town you’re just a guest in. So you work your life away just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin…\"\n\n\"And the hurricane with my name, when it came. I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away. Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine. Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time.\"\n\n\"And you're cheating husband disappeared, well no one asks any questions here.\"\n\n\"So I did my best to lay to rest all of the bodies that have ever been on my body. And in my mind, they sink into a swamp. Is that a bad thing to say in a song?\"\n\n'Guilty as Sin?'\n\n\"My boredom’s bone-deep. This cage was once just fine. Am I allowed to cry?\"\n\n\"I dream of cracking locks, throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks. Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox. I'm seeing visions, am I bad? Or mad? Or wise?\"\n\n\"What if he’s written 'mine' on my upper thigh only in my mind?\"\n\n\"Without ever touching his skin, how can I be guilty as sin?\"\n\n\"I keep these longings locked in lowercase, inside a vault. Someone told me there’s no such thing as bad thoughts. Only your actions talk.'\"\n\n\"If it’s make-believe, why does it feel like a vow we’ll both uphold somehow?\"\n\n\"My bedsheeets are ablaze, I've screamed his name. Building up like waves crashing over my grave.\"\n\n\"Am I allowed to cry?\"\n\n'Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?'\n\n\"You don’t get to tell me about 'sad.'\"\n\n\"So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street. Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream, 'Who’s afraid of little old me?'”\n\n\"The scandal was contained, the bullet had just grazed at all costs, keep your good name.\"\n\n\"I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean. Don’t you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth.\"\n\n\"I want to snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me. You wouldn’t last an hour in the asylum where they raised me.\"\n\n\"I’m always drunk on my own tears, isn’t that what they all said? That I’ll sue you if you step on my lawn. That I’m fearsome, and I’m wretched, and I’m wrong. Put narcotics into all of my songs. And that’s why you still singing along.\"\n\n'I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)'\n\n\"The smoke cloud billows out his mouth like a freight train through a small town. The jokes that he told across the bar were revolting and far too loud.\"\n\n\"The dopamine races through his brain on a six-lane Texas highway. His hand, so callous from his pistol softly traces hearts on my face.\"\n\n\"Good boy, that’s right. Come close, I’ll show you heaven. If you’ll be an angel all night. Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man. No really I can.\"\n\n\"I can fix him, no really I can. Whoa, maybe I can’t.\"\n\n'loml'\n\n\"We embroidered the memories of the time I was away, stitching, \"We were just kids, babe.\"\n\n\"I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed. I felt aglow like this, never before and never since.\"\n\n\"When your Impressionist paintings of Heaven turned out to be fakes. Well, you took me to hell too. And all at once, the ink bleeds. A conman sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme.\"\n\n\"You sh**-talked me under the table, talking rings and talking cradles. I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all.\"\n\n\"Dancing phantoms on the terrace, are they second-hand embarrassed that I can’t get out of bed 'cause something counterfeit’s dead?\"\n\n'I Can Do It With a Broken Heart'\n\n\"I can read your mind, \"She’s having the time of her life.\" There in her glittering prime the lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night. I can show you lies.\"\n\n\"They said, 'Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it and I did.\"\n\n\"Lights, camera, b**** smile.\"\n\n\"I cry a lot, but I am so productive. It's an art.\"\n\n\"All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, \"More!\" I was grinning like I’m winning. I was hitting my marks 'cause I can do it with a broken heart.\"\n\n\"Try and come for my job.\"\n\n'The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived'\n\n\"Gazing at me starry-eyed in your Jehovah's Witness suit. Who the f*** was that guy?\"\n\n\"You tried to buy some pills from a friend of friends of mine. They just ghosted you. Now you know what it feels like.\"\n\n\"And I don’t miss what we had, but could someone give a message to the smallest man who ever lived?\"\n\n\"You hung me on your wall, stabbed me with your push pins. In public, showed me off, then sank in stoned oblivion.\"\n\n\"You didn’t measure up in any measure of a man.\"\n\n\"In 50 years will all this be declassified? And you’ll confess why you did it? And I'll say, 'Good riddance.'\"\n\n\"You deserve prison, but you won’t get time. You’ll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars. You crashed my party and your rental car.\"\n\n'The Alchemy'\n\n\"So when I touch down, call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team. Ditch the clowns, get the crown, baby I’m the one to beat.\"\n\n\"'Cause the sign on your heart said it’s still reserved for me. Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?\"\n\n\"I haven't come around in so long, but I'm making a comeback to where I belong.\"\n\n\"He jokes that it’s heroin but this time with an 'E'.\"\n\n\"Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me.\"\n\n'Clara Bow'\n\n\"This town is fake, but you’re the real thing. Breath of fresh air through smoke rings.\"\n\n\"Crowd goes wild at her fingertips, half moonshine, a full eclipse.\"\n\n\"The crown is stained, but you’re the real queen. Flesh and blood amongst war machines. You’re the new god we’re worshipping. Promise to be dazzling.\"\n\n\"Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours demanding, \"More.\"\n\n\"You look like Taylor Swift in this light, we’re loving it. You’ve got edge she never did. The future’s bright, dazzling.\"\n\n'The Black Dog'\n\n\"I am someone who until recent events you shared with your secrets with and your location, you forgot to turn it off.\"\n\n\"Old habits die screaming.\"\n\n\"I move through the world with a heart broken. My longings stay unspoken and I may never open up the way I did for you and all of those best laid plans.\"\n\n\"Do you hate me? Was it hazing for a cruel fraternity I pledged.\"\n\n\"Now I wanna sell my house and set fire to all my clothes and hire a priest to come and exorcize my demons, even if I die screaming.\"\n\n'imgonnagetyouback'\n\n\"Whether I'm gonna be your wife or gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet but I'm gonna get you back.\"\n\n\"I hear the whispers in your eyes. I'll make you wanna think twice.\"\n\n\"I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch. Then ran and hid.\"\n\n\"Whether I'm gonna flip you off or pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet but I'm gonna get you back.\"\n\n\"Push the reset button, we're becoming something new.\"\n\n\"Pick your poison, babe. I'm poison either way.\"\n\nThe Albatross\n\n\"A rose by any other name is a scandal.\"\n\n\"Cross your thoughtless heart only liquor anoints you. She's the albatross. She is here to destroy you.\"\n\n\"Devils that you know raise worse hell than a stranger.\"\n\n\"She's the death you chose you're in terrible danger.\"\n\n\"Wise men once read fake news and they believed it. Jackals raised their hackles you couldn't conceive it.\"\n\n\"The devil that you know looks now more like an angel.\"\n\n'Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus'\n\n\"Your hologram stumbled into my apartment hands in the hair of somebody in darkness.\"\n\n\"As the decade would play us for fools and you saw my bones out with somebody new who seemed like he would've bullied you in school and you just watched it happen.\"\n\n\"If you want to break my cold, cold heart just say, 'I loved you the way that you were.'\"\n\n\"You said some things that I can't unabsorb. You turned me into an idea of sorts. You needed me, but you needed drugs more and I couldn't watch it happen.\"\n\n\"I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools. Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules. All to outrun my desertion of you. And you just watched it.\"\n\n\"If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh down that passage in time. Back to the moment I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do, too impaired by my youth to know what to do.\"\n\n'How Did It End?'\n\n\"We hereby conduct this post mortem.\"\n\n\"Come one, come all, it's happening again. The empathetic hunger descends. We'll tell no one except all of our friends. We must know how did it end?\"\n\n\"We learned the right steps to different dances.\"\n\n\"Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?\"\n\n\"Say it once again with feeling how the death rattle breathing silenced as the soul was leaving the deflation of our dreaming.\"\n\n\"My beloved ghost and me sitting in a tree D-Y-I-N-G.\"\n\n'So High School'\n\n\"I feel so high school every time I look at you.\"\n\n\"I want to find you in a crowd just to hide from you.\"\n\n\"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? Kill me. It's just a game, but really, really, I'm betting on all three for us two.\"\n\n\"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle, brand new, full throttle. Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto. It's true, swear, scouts honor. You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her.\"\n\n\"Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights tell me 'bout the first time you saw me. I'll drink what you think and I'm high from smokin' your jokes all damn night.\"\n\n'I Hate It Here'\n\n\"Quick, quick tell me something awful like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy.\"\n\n\"Tell me all your secrets. All you'll ever be is. My eternal consolation prize.\"\n\n\"I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind people need a key to get to. The only one is mine.\"\n\n\"My friends used to play a game where we would pick a decade we wished we could live in instead of this. I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists and getting married off for the highest bid.\"\n\n\"I'm lonely, but I'm good. I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine. I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose.\"\n\n\"Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me and in my fantasies I rise above it. And way up there, I actually love it.\"\n\n'thanK you aIMee'\n\n\"When I picture my hometown there's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you. And a plaque underneath it that threatens to push me down the stairs at our school.\"\n\n\"But I dreamed that one day I could say all that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'. And I can't forgive the way you made me feel.\"\n\n\"And then she wrote headlines in the local paper laughing at each baby step I'd take.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman but she used to say she wished that you were dead.\"\n\n\"I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool. I built a legacy that you can't undo. But when I count the scars there's a moment of truth. That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you.\"\n\n\"And so I changed your name and any real defining clues. And one day your kid comes home singing a song that only us two is gonna know is about you.\"\n\n\"Screamed, 'thanK you aIMee' to the night sky and the stars are stunnin' 'cause I can't forget the way you made me heal.\"\n\n'I Look in People's Windows'\n\n\"Northbound I got carried away as you boarded your train south, south, south, south, south, south.\"\n\n\"I look in people's windows in case you're at their table. What if your eyes looked up and met mine one more time.\"\n\n\"I'm addicted to the 'if only.'\"\n\n\"I look in people's windows like I'm some deranged weirdo. I attend Christmas parties from the outside.\"\n\n'The Prophecy'\n\n\"I got cursed like Eve got bitten.\"\n\n\"I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope. A greater woman wouldn't beg. But I looked to the sky and said, 'Please, I've been on my knees. Change the prophecy.'\"\n\n\"Don't want money just someone who wants my company. Let it once be me. Who do I have to speak to about if they can redo the prophecy?\"\n\n\"Slow is the quicksand. Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand. Oh, still I dream of him.\"\n\n\"And I look unstable gathered with a coven round a sorceress' table. A greater woman has faith but even statues crumble if they're made to wait.\"\n\n\"I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige. Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay.\"\n\n'Cassandra'\n\n\"When the first stone's thrown there's screamin.' In the streets there's a ragin' riot. When it's, 'Burn the b****,\" they're shrieking. When the truth comes out it's quiet.\"\n\n\"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say \"Do you believe me now?'\"\n\n\"I was in my tower weaving nightmares, twisting all my smiles into snarls. They say what doesn't kill you makes you aware. What happens if it becomes who you are?\"\n\n\"Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll. Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul.\"\n\n\"When the truth comes out it's quiet. It's so quiet.\"\n\n'Peter'\n\n\"The goddess of timing once found us beguiling. She said she was trying. Peter, was she lying?\"\n\n\"Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep. But never to keep.\"\n\n\"And sometimes it gets me when crossing your jet stream. We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon in different galaxies.\"\n\n\"'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried to hold onto the days when you were mine.

The art is still the art. The artists have found us, and we are the venue for that. But now it’s time that the building and the facility are equal to the quality of what’s happening inside,” said Ralph Fey, a long-standing board member of New Hope Arts.\n\nConnecting the community with local artists has been an ongoing mission of the New Hope Arts Center, since it began without a physical location in 2002 before acquiring its property, an early 19th century stone structure along the Delaware Canal, in 2009.\n\nBut over the years, the building has presented limitations in furthering the center’s goal to increase exposure and appreciation for the local arts community thanks to issues like its indiscernible front entrance, steep staircase and limited natural lighting.\n\nAnd while the organization intends to honor the building’s history — originally a barn, which previously operated as a foundry, theater, gas station and fencing studio before becoming home to New Hope Arts — the campaign looks to drive the organization forward by increasing its visibility and accessibility.\n\n“Our mission, which was established early on, continues to be a place for the arts and a place for the community and the arts to meet. Where we can provide that environment and make it accessible is our next goal,” said Fey, who designed the building renovations with the help of his team at Ralph C. Fey Architects, based in Doylestown.\n\nThe firm is currently pursuing approvals with New Hope Borough with the aim of starting construction in January 2023, a project which is expected to take about four months to complete.\n\n“I’ve been working on the improvement of this building with the board for 18 years. And this is a pretty proud moment for us to go from a little project to a little project to a significant project and a capital campaign that will elevate the building and elevate the arts,” said Fey.\n\nRenovation plans include a dramatic front entranceway with new signage, an updated interior lobby with an ADA restroom, an elevator, a larger open staircase, a rear entrance with an ADA ramp and improvements to the exterior façade.\n\n“With our new vision … we will move it forward even more vigorously toward embracing a community arts organization,” said Carol Cruickshanks, executive directorof New Hope Arts.“This would not be possible if it were not for a very stalwart board of directors, as well as a staff that have been dedicated over the course of the years to making this happen,” she noted.\n\nThe elevator installation, which will be the first step in the proposed renovations, was made possible by a $116,000 Pennsylvania Community and Economic Development grant, initiated by Sen. Steve Santarsiero.\n\n“The one thing that was sort of was our springboard for this capital campaign was Senator Santarsiero’s office. That really became the inspiration for us to go to the next level,” said New Hope Mayor Larry Keller, as he credited the board, staff, donors and the support of local political leaders in helping to get the campaign off the ground.\n\n“For me personally, as a resident, as a business owner, this is a dream come true, not only for me as a resident, mayor, etc., but all of us, all this community. There’s a reason New Hope is thriving right now. New Hope Arts, I think, is a big part of that,” said Keller, who is also chairman of the board for New Hope Arts.\n\nNew Hope artist Robert Beck, who attended the unveiling, emphasized the importance of venues like the New Hope Arts Center in providing a space for artists to learn and exchange ideas, to inspire one another and the community as a whole, and propel the arts forward in all its various forms.\n\n“It’s the only place you’ll find that freedom of idea, that core creation is in the arts. And this is a place to bring that all together, bring all of them, the creators and the rest of the community, together,” said Beck.\n\n“It is inspiring to an artist, it’s inspiring to an audience, to know that you can get there from nothing. Anybody can develop their own voice and go someplace from nothing in their own genre or medium. It’s in everybody,” he added.\n\nFor subscribers: Doylestown Township approves Terrain development plans for former DelVal market site\n\nThe first phase of the Elevate the Arts Campaign was launched privately in January. In that time, members of the board have received $173,000 in pledges.\n\nCampaign initiatives include digital and social media campaigning, ambassador initiatives, a video series and a donor recognition program.\n\nAdditionally, a 20th Anniversary Gala will be held on May 24 at Hotel Du Village on River Road in New Hope. The fundraising event includes hors d'oeuvres, drinks, live and silent art auctions and live music.\n\nArtwork for the live auction have been donated by Robert Beck, Malcolm Bray, Miriam Carpenter, Rita Gekht, Kevin Kopil, Justin Long, Sean Mount, Rye Tippet.\n\nTickets are $150 a person and can be purchased online at newhopearts.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2021/11/12/newfields-indianapolis-art-museum-plans-shake-up-nearly-every-gallery/6238558001/", "title": "Newfields has plans to shake up nearly every gallery in the art ...", "text": "Before The Lume came to life at Newfields, the fourth floor was home to some of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's most expansive works.

The artists have developmental disabilities.\n\nThrough their work and creativity, the section has been reborn with a rainbow of vivid colors and varied patterns. Yarn art stylizes Court Avenue from Fourth to Sixth Street NW, and is on display through September.\n\n\"I think it's worth checking out just because it's pretty,\" said Hollis, of North Canton. \"It's whimsical and fun. There's the ladybug and the bicycles. They just tend to stop people in their tracks. They stop and they look and they go, 'Oh, 'That's a hat' or, 'What did they do to the bicycle?'\"\n\nHollis is among the more than 30 volunteers who helped with the project, knitting pieces themselves and installing the artwork.\n\n\"This was just fun and beautiful,\" she said. \"We spent so many hours on it. I made friends doing it.\"\n\nJust Imagine is an art program provided by The Workshops Inc. (TWi), a Canton-based nonprofit agency serving 400 adults with disabilities in Stark County.

She's also a local artist who operates BZTAT Studios in downtown Canton.\n\nCommunity volunteers taught some of the artists how to knit. Local art studios and art-related businesses also assisted with the project, Doty said.\n\n\"We're very proud of this,\" she said. \"Our slogan (at TWi) is, 'Together we soar.'\"\n\nNeither the artists nor the volunteers could have done it alone, Doty said.\n\nAnd the public is \"unlikely to see something like this in other communities,\" she said. \"It's unique and something Canton can be proud of.\"\n\nAlso known as urban or guerilla knitting, yarn bombing is a popular street art trend worldwide, Doty explained. Graffiti-style, unsanctioned yarn art has been removed in some cities, however, she said.\n\nThe artform, considered a way of reclaiming and beautifying public spaces such as benches and trees, began more than 10 years ago.\n\n'Every time you come through here, you see something different.'\n\nAround 400 individual hand-knitted pieces were incorporated into the exhibit, which took more than three months to plan, finish and install.\n\n\"Every time you come through here, you see something new,\" Doty said. \"That is the beauty – every time you see (the artwork), you're going to see something different.\n\n\"Everyone who comes through here, this (display) means something different,\" she added.\n\nThe expression of art is a \"unique representation of what can be achieved when individuals with developmental disabilities are included in all facets of our community,\" Doty said in a news release.\n\nShe added that \"the exhibit recognizes the contributions individuals with developmental disabilities make to our community ... (while) celebrating the acceptance and inclusion they receive.\"\n\n'It just puts me in my own little world when I knit.'\n\nThe project was inspired by one of the Just Imagine artists who is skilled at knitting, Doty said.\n\n\"She's known for her beautiful scarves, and when people come (to the gallery), they ask for her scarves,\" Doty said.\n\nArtists from Just Imagine explained why they enjoyed knitting pieces and contributing to the art collaborative. Names of the artists interviewed for this article are not included at the request of their guardians.\n\nSome Just Imagine artists were introduced to knitting for the first time. Others also paint, sculpt or make bracelets from rubber bands.\n\n\"It just puts me in my own little world when I knit,\" one of the artists said.\n\n\"I was just so amazed by it,\" she said of Court Avenue. \"Just coming down here and looking at it piece by little piece as the volunteers were putting it up.\"\n\n'One big family' creates yarn art exhibit\n\nAnother Just Imagine artist compared the display to a rainbow.\n\n\"It makes me smile,\" she said. \"It's really hard work to do this.\"\n\nAnother artist said those who worked together on the project are \"one big family.\"\n\nDoty agreed with the sentiment.\n\n\"It's definitely a family atmosphere here,\" she said of the artists at Just Imagine who create art pieces for sale at the gallery and gift shop at 201 Sixth St. NW.\n\n\"It certainly enriches their lives,\" Doty said. \"So typical people and folks with disabilities are no different.

There was none happier than the university’s remarkable First Lady, Janice Hawkins, for whom it was named.\n\nHer husband, Troy University Chancellor Jack Hawkins, and their daughters Katie Hawkins Beall and Kelly Hawkins Godwin, beamed with pride, as she was heralded as “a cheerleader” for the university and a shepherd of many of its projects.\n\nThe arts park and an adjacent International Arts Center are now among the latest enhancements to Troy’s landscape that ultimately materialized from a vision Mrs. Hawkins nurtured for years.\n\nA cheerleader for the Arts\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nSince the Chancellor brought his family to Troy in the late summer of 1989, Mrs. Hawkins has championed efforts in support of veterans and the active military, Troy Athletics, campus organizations, as well as students and their families. Yet, as a proponent of the arts, there was always something else on her mind.\n\nWhen I visited the Chancellor and First Lady to showcase their beautiful university campus residence in the Montgomery Advertiser’s Home Gallery in 2009, a kudzu-covered ravine was visible across the street as the greenspace view from their front door. Even then, Mrs. Hawkins shared a vision to have it evolve to a place where people of all ages could “come together to celebrate, to dance, to sing, to learn and to find inspiration.”\n\nRecently, she admitted to having spent many days mumbling to herself while walking its perimeter, realizing those around her were perhaps, looking at her oddly for doing so. They didn’t know she was praying that the space would become a place of contemplation and relaxation for others.\n\nThose prayers were amended to include an expanded vision after she enjoyed lunch with her husband in the old Stewart Hall Dining Hall nearby. During that meal, Dr. Hawkins admired its architecture, and mentioned that it “would make a great art department.” That innocent remark set the wheels turning again for Mrs. Hawkins, especially when she learned later that the building had been recommended for demolition. She had new plans for it.\n\nWith the support of the Troy family and its Trustees, donors, supporters, friends and several unsung heroes in the months that followed, she spearheaded the transformation and repurposing of both the greenspace and the old hall. They joined her to celebrate the happy day when her vision came to fruition.\n\nBefore the doors of Stewart Hall were re-opened as the new International Arts Center, they gathered on the grounds surrounding an open air amphitheater with six iconic columns, performance terrace and elevated curved rows of stone bench seating. As a first glimpse to its intended use as a venue for cultural entertainment, the dedication ceremony included performances by music, theatre and dance ensembles of the university’s College of Communication and Fine Arts.\n\nWhere East meets West\n\nWith a walking bridge spanning over a tranquil lagoon as a backdrop, they played hymns, sang, danced and recited words of praise surrounded by walking trails that led around the expansive grassy knoll.\n\nWithin the distance, those gathered had an incredible view of several prominent outdoor art installations. Among them, an army of about 200 terracotta life-size warrior replicas are bunkered in formation into the hill on one side of the park.\n\nRecognized during the dedication ceremony by members of the Alabama Legislature as a “Honorary Alabama Citizen,” Chinese sculptor Huo Bao Zhu had created the unique installation of warriors, believed to be the largest such collection of statuaries outside of China. Produced in his factory in China from a pile of clay within a 12-month period, they were brought to the U.S., and displayed as the latest of his works, which generously began appearing around the campus in 2002.\n\n100 of the warriors were actually donated by Zhu, but all are placed in the line of sight of the Violata Pax Dove, sculpted by another international artist and positioned to rise over the hill on the other side of the park as the focal point of the Daniel Foundation Plaza. Both artistic installations symbolically highlight Troy University as a point “where East meets West.”\n\nDesigned by Troy native, Fred “Nall” Hollis, the 15-foot dove intentionally incorporates intricate treatments, as well as imperfections to achieve the symbolic nature of beauty and sorrow in its monumental design. Nall presented the dove as a gift to Hawkins several years ago. Without breathing a word about her vision for the campus area and the dove’s use, it was put into storage at the time; but became the impetus for the effort that culminated with the dual opening of the park and the International Arts Center, which houses two galleries inside.\n\nSee to believe\n\nOne was constructed in Nall’s name, and houses an extensive collection of works from the 1960s to today, about three-quarters of which was donated to Troy. The vivid and stunning imagery mounted on the walls, and positioned on its floors are the real-life installations of several of the art reflected on the pages of Nall Alchemy, a coffee table-style book, published in 2006.\n\nAcross the hall, the Huo Bao Zhu Gallery features visiting exhibits as well as a revolving gallery of art. It also houses The Warriors Unearthed exhibit by artist Frank Marquette, a collection of and interpretive center reflecting the history behind the famous terracotta warriors. Mr. Marquette was responsible for the design of the outdoor exhibits as well. Incomprehensible to imagine, you have to see the exhibits to imagine them. They join an educational space, a lab and space to showcase the works of the university’s art students on a continuing basis.\n\nDragon dancers of the university’s Confucius Institute had beckoned everyone inside to wander through the galleries, and to see a commissioned painting by Elana Hagler, that was created and unveiled to provide a glimpse of the university’s growth from its original architectural plan, into today’s modern campus facility.\n\nA little help from friends\n\nIn addition to the artistic contributions, funding for the construction of the Janice Hawkins Cultural Arts Park and the International Arts Center was provided through the generous donations of Troy University’s partners, including The Daniel Foundation of Alabama; the City of Troy; Cindy and Mike Dodds; The Family of Robert D. Hawkins Sr.; Mike Howard; Elmore and Jim Inscoe; Joan and Mac McLendon; the Edwin and Elizabeth Skelton Foundation; Sodexo Higher Education; Troy University Center Services; and state Rep. Alan Boothe.\n\nBoothe was among those extending accolades to Janice Hawkins and the prominent team of artists, as he shared the podium with state Sen. Jimmy Holley; state Sen. Gerald Dial, President Pro Tempore of the university’s Board of Trustees; and university Trustee Lamar Higgins.\n\nThey were among those joining the parade of guests that followed the choir as it led the way with “Oh Happy Day” up the hill to the Daniel Foundation Plaza, where the Troy University Jazz Quartet entertained during a reception to celebrate the day’s remarkable event.\n\nPlanning an event?\n\nShare your upcoming events with Deborah Hayes Moore via email at socialcolumn@yahoo.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/02/14/barack-and-michelle-obama-post-sweet-tweets-each-other-valentines-day/337133002/", "title": "Barack and Michelle Obama post sweet tweets to each other for ...", "text": "Just days after attesting publicly to his wife's \"hotness,\" former President Barack Obama tweeted sweet nothings to her for Valentine's Day, after she posted a loved-up playlist for him.\n\nAll together now: Awwww.

He added that plans for other murals across the city honoring the victims have fallen through as property owners backed out of the plan.\n\nGus Delgado, owner of Old Sheepdog Brewery, is working with Ortega and Martinez to promote revival in the neighborhood through art.

Also, since many people had to stay home, their spending was reduced and now they have money for artwork, he added.\n\nWant more news like this?

Fans flock from all corners of the globe to pay their respects to Selena Quintanilla-Perez, the beloved singer and performer who was murdered March 31, 1995.\n\nSelena and her band, Selena y los Dinos, had performed before more than 61,000 fans in February that year at the Houston Rodeo, she had won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Performance the year before and was set to release her first English crossover album. But her rise was cut short and fans were devastated by the loss.\n\nPlanning the memorial\n\nWhile she had admirers all over the world, locally her music was known mainly by Tejano fans and thus there was a distinct division along ethnic lines. Many of the city’s Anglo population struggled to understand what the big deal was, while her Hispanic fans decried the ambivalence and outright hostility locals and outsiders (I’m looking at you, Howard Stern) heaped on the family and mourners.\n\nMayor Mary Rhodes appointed members to a Selena Memorial Committee in mid-April 1995 to come up with proposals on how best to honor Selena. Business owner and philanthropist Dusty Durrill stepped into the fray and proposed a memorial overlook and statue, designed to blend in with the bayfront miradors he helped create and fund several years earlier. After some back and forth – Durrill felt the City Council should have accepted the offer immediately, but the council wanted to consider it along with several other proposals – the mirador plan was approved.\n\nConstruction and dedication\n\nConstruction of the memorial began in late 1996. Durrill selected sculptor H.W. “Buddy” Tatum to create the statue. An early mockup of the statue shows Selena wearing a slinky dress and holding a white rose, but the final bronze sculpture depicts the singer looking toward the bay and wearing leather pants, bustier, boots and motorcycle jacket, a replica of her outfit housed at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.\n\nThe statue and pavilion cost $600,000, paid for by the Devary Durrill Foundation, and was dedicated May 25, 1997. The memorial also includes a white sculpted rose above a dedication plaque. The foundation also enlisted the public’s help and a $100 contribution earned an engraved brick paver in the plaza’s floor.\n\nPaseo de la Flor\n\nOne aspect of the memorial that visitors may overlook is the walkway below the mirador. Steps on both sides of the pavilion lead down to a short sidewalk lined with mosaic rose tiles. More than 500 children from McAllen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Premont, Mathis, Alice, San Diego and San Antonio along with senior citizens from the Zavala Senior Center helped paint the tiles. Artist Ricardo Ruiz created the design based on ideas from Ed and Cornelia Gates of Aloe Tile Works, whose business created the mural.\n\nEd Gates described the design as \"a big bouquet of roses thrown up in the air – exploding like Selena's music exploded – with a ribbon of music running through them.\" Tiles on both ends include the inscriptions “Hand-painted by Texas children who loved Selena.\" The walkway was dedicated on Oct. 4, 1997.\n\nMemorial upkeep\n\nBy 2000, fans were writing messages on the memorial so often that city maintenance crews had to repaint the area at least once a week, and sometimes as often as three times a week. Some had even defaced the statue itself, carving their initials into the bronze.\n\nThe city approached the Quintanilla family about putting up a barrier to protect the statue. The Selena Foundation approved a design and in September 2000 a 4-foot-high, stainless steel railing encircling the statue and rose was installed. The Devary Durrill Foundation paid for the barrier and its installation.\n\nFans continue to write messages on the bricks and in 2012 the Corpus Christi Parks and Recreation Department spent about $24,000 to complete minor repair and restoration work of the statue and mirador. The money was part of budgeted public art maintenance funds.\n\nAt the statue dedication in 1997, Selena’s father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, commented, \"20 or 30 years from now, her fans will remember her, besides her music. A lot of tourists are coming in wanting to know about Selena. This will work to that effect.\"\n\nI stopped by the mirador this week on my lunch break and even on a random weekday there was a small crowd gathered in the plaza, taking photos and reading the inscriptions. It’s now 21 years later and fans still remember.\n\nAllison Ehrlich is the archive coordinator for the Caller-Times.

He also spent that time packing up his artwork and displaying it anywhere he could.\n\nBut after so many years, Sturm was happy to learn he would finally have the chance to show his beautiful paintings with an exhibition in his hometown.\n\n“I always have a ready-to-go-show to load in my truck and take to churches or a bank or whatever, when they call for an instant art show but for the last three years I’ve been trying to do an art show in Mount Olive where I live so I don’t have to drive and set up everything,” said Sturm, who raised four children with his wife Kitty in Budd Lake.\n\n“Right in my own town. It’s like a dream. I can’t believe it.”\n\nOn Saturday, September 26, from 6-9 p.m., Bentley Commons at Paragon Village will host a collection of more than 70 oil paintings by William C. Sturm as a charitable fundraising event to benefit the mission of Antler Ridge Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nAsked by the owners to paint their Sanctuary, Sturm will unveil his rendering of Antler Ridge for the first time. The Sanctuary will produce prints of the masterpiece as a fundraiser for their nonprofit organization.\n\nAntler Ridge Wildlife Sanctuary, a 120-acre preserved farm located in Warren County, is a wildlife rehabilitation center that provides vital care and treatment to sick, injured or orphaned wildlife.\n\nLicensed by the state of New Jersey to care for fawns, raccoon, skunks, opossums, squirrels, rabbits, woodchucks and other small mammals, the Sanctuary is dedicated to rehabilitating these animals back to health so they can be returned to the wild where they belong.\n\nThe suggested donation is $10 and will include wines from Brook Hollow Winery and artesian cheeses. Paragon Village is located at 425 Route 46 East in Hackettstown. For more information, call 908-498-0118.\n\n“Three years ago I went up there and saw what they do. It’s owned by the Chief of Police in Roxbury and his wife and they’re dedicated to wildlife. They’ve made their farm into a refuge for wounded, wild animals. Boy, what a job they did,” said Sturm, who has 11 grandchildren.\n\n“We’re going to unveil the painting and they will not have seen the finished work until that night. It’s going to be one painting but it’s of their sanctuary. It’s really going to be great. It’s too fun.”\n\nSturm’s collection will be on display at Paragon Village through December and will include the more than 70 local scenes he’s painted over the years. Paintings he did for private collections are also being loaned to him for the show and will be seen by a larger audience for the first time in years.\n\nMany of his paintings still hang in the jury room at the Morristown Courthouse. He was also commissioned to paint the USS Forrestal Aircraft Carrier which was on display in Annapolis, Maryland for a long time. After residing at the American Legion in Stanhope, the painting was recently included in a new display in Annapolis but has been returned in time to be a centerpiece of the show.\n\n“I’m going to be there from one to five o’clock every Sunday so if anybody wants to stop in and see the show, I will be there. Every Sunday. If schools or church groups or anybody wants to have a little meeting there, they can anytime. I’ll set it up and I’ll be there for the meeting if they would like to bring a group,” Sturm said.\n\n“My wife is 78 and she used to always go with me while I was painting but she can’t go with me anymore. So I said, okay, we’re going to just stay right in town. And that’s where I am and I love it. It’s really going to be a lot of fun, I think.”\n\nSturm grew up in Budd Lake but at age 11 began working at a dairy farm in Mendham. After long days milking cows and attending to chores, the youngster enjoyed periodic trips to Bertrand’s Island in Lake Hopatcong whenever he got the chance.\n\n“I worked for a guy that was about 18 years old at the time and two or three times during the summer, I’d go to him and say, hey, Fred, what do you say, let’s go to Bertand’s Island. He’d say no, we have too much work to do. But about the time he finished milking, I’d have a truck filled with hay bales strewn all over the back. I would only have to make one call to have about 18 kids all jump in the truck with me and we’d go on a hay ride to Bertrand’s Island,” Sturm said.\n\n“So the painting that we eventually did includes all that. A print of that is in the show because that painting’s in a private collection. I painted a great deal in Lake Hopatcong. It’s fun. It really is.”\n\nAfter graduating from Netcong High School, Sturm attended Delaware Valley College in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, where he majored in agriculture and played football. After college he taught chemistry for 34 years at Dover High School.\n\n“At the same time, I learned to really paint and I was painting all over. I didn’t want to have anything to do with painting until I was in my thirties because then you really have something to paint. That only comes later in life. That’s why these paintings, the stuff we paint, I like it to be entertaining, I like it to be informative, I like it to be inspiring, but I like it to have strings attached to it. Heartstrings,” Sturm said.\n\n“So that when people see it in the area, they know it. Those are the things I like to do. It’s fun. I still paint. Every day. It used to be a hobby. Now it’s my life’s work.”\n\nHelp the Homeless\n\nHandsome Pesto is an adorable terrier that was found in an overcrowded shelter in rural North Carolina.

Alexander Looby's five-room home, fell short of its target and tumbled toward the foundation.\n\nThe explosion slashed the early morning stillness on Meharry Boulevard, shattering nearly 150 windows at Meharry Medical College across the street.\n\nAsleep inside his house, Looby — a nationally known NAACP civil rights attorney — and his wife, Grafta, barely escaped unharmed.\n\nThe damage set off a protest like few had ever seen in Nashville. On April 19, 1960, in response to that morning's violent action, more than 3,000 college students marched silently to City Hall.\n\nThey walked 3.5 miles through the city, beginning at Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State University, along Jefferson Street, up 4th Ave. N., and on to the courthouse.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThey stood three abreast and did not speak.\n\n\"We wanted Nashville to hear our footsteps,\" said Ernest \"Rip\" Patton, a future Freedom Rider who tread the Nashville streets that day.\n\nNashville Mayor Ben West met them on the plaza.\n\nThere, Fisk University student Diane Nash impelled the mayor to acknowledge the depravity of discrimination and then put forth the question that changed history.\n\n“Mayor,\" she asked, \"do you recommend that the lunch counters be desegregated?”\n\n“Yes,” West replied.\n\nThree weeks later, black students and residents ate at the downtown lunch counters where so many sit-ins had been staged, and Nashville became the first city in the South to desegregate.\n\nNow, just a few feet from where those students silently demanded acceptance 57 years ago, a memorial stands.\n\nWitness Walls is Nashville's first civil-rights inspired public art.\n\nA collection of fragmented concrete walls, the sculpture places visitors among the heroic people who took part in that march and in Nashville's civil rights movement. The art focuses on the \"mundane actions\" of sitting and standing, rendered — as Witness Walls artist Walter Hood said — \"so extraordinary by their intent: desegregation.\"\n\nThe project, led by the Metro Nashville Arts Commission, will be unveiled at a celebration ceremony on Friday at Nashville's Public Square Park.\n\n\"We are at this moment,\" Hood said. \"Now is the time for conversation. This is not just about commemoration, but about memory.\"\n\nAnd about an experience.\n\nStanding 7 feet, 6 inches tall, the walls use shadow and light to capture the metaphor of struggle as figures and scenes emerge and retreat along the walls' coarse surfaces.\n\nSome walls are flat, with a mosaic of black rock creating pictures of mothers grasping small children's hands, demonstrators falling to the ground and police wielding clubs and seizing marchers. Other walls are curved, covered in compositions of photographic images of praying and preaching and protesting, all selected from the Nashville Banner collections at the Nashville Public Library.\n\nThe outdoor space also includes reflective fountains, benches and musical recordings from the civil rights era.\n\nThe idea is to create a different way of moving, and a different way of thinking.\n\n\"We want to construct new narratives,\" Hood said.\n\nWhat figures will you know?\n\nThough the Witness Walls include images of notables like Nash and the Rev. Dr. Kelly Miller Smith Sr. and Matthew Walker Jr., it is not meant to be a memorial only to those civil rights leaders mentioned most.\n\nNot everybody sat at a stool. Not everyone delivered speeches.\n\nClergy organized meetings. Mothers walked their children to newly desegregated schools. Students, both black and white, walked picket lines or served as community messengers to report arrests.\n\nWitness Walls reflect the many actions change.\n\n\"The civil rights history in this city, and in others, is a movement,\" said Jennifer Cole, executive director of the Metro Nashville Arts Commission. \"Individual people get called out in the history books, and those people played important roles, but when you peel back Nashville's story it was thousands and thousands of people who you will never see in a book and who you will never hear mentioned who did very small but collectively important things.\"\n\nIt's 2017, why did it take so long for the city to recognize Civil Rights with art?\n\nThe art has been a long time coming.\n\nIdeas for a civil-rights inspired piece arose in 2011 when the Nashville Civil Rights Veterans Association approached the city about honoring the local movement for equality.\n\nThe next year, plans for a sculpture were put in place for a stretch of Fifth Avenue North in the heart of downtown, where a group of mostly black college students from Fisk University, American Baptist College and then-Tennessee A&I University (now Tennessee State) staged sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in 1960. They tested downtown businesses such as Woolworth's, Walgreens, McLellan's and Grant's by asking to be served.\n\nThey were refused.\n\nThe actions were not only part of the greater civil rights movement in the United States, they were formative in it.\n\nBut, in the ever-changing landscape that is Nashville today, the location originally identified for the public art to honor those activists fell through. At the same time, the Commission received some criticism for choosing a location that was too small and allotting too little money.\n\nIn response, the Commission budgeted more and found another location of significance — the place to where students marched the day they protested the bombing of Looby's home.\n\nPatton, a former Tennessee A&I student and a 1961 Freedom Rider, marched that April day in 1960.\n\nA friendship and a trip to the movie theater that inspired activism\n\nA native Nashvillian, he was in 3rd grade when he first became aware of racism. He often played make-believe games like cowboys and Indians with a white boy who lived across the alley from his North Nashville home. When his friend came outside one day bubbling over with excitement from a trip to the movie theater, the boy told Patton: \"Tell your mama to take you to see a movie.\"\n\nShe did, but as Patton excitedly approached the theater and headed for the front door, his mother pulled him away.\n\n“But my friend said …” were all the words of protest Patton got out before his mother, with a stern look, led him down an alley and up a set of dark steps to the balcony of the theater. He knew that day he would someday stand against that injustice.\n\n\"Nashville was my home,\" the now 77-year-old Patton said. \"It was part of my job to clean it up.\"\n\nYears later, when Patton joined the civil rights movement as a music major at Tennessee A&I, his mother said with satisfaction, “I knew that you would be a part of that.\"\n\nHis role was that of a runner. He stood outside the stores where the sit-ins were being staged, and when students were arrested, he would go to the nearest phone, fish coins out of his pocket, and call First Baptist Capitol Hill church where the demonstrations were being coordinated. \"The Walgreen’s students are being arrested,\" he would say. Then a second group assigned to Walgreen’s would come from the church and fill up the stools again.\n\nLater, Patton, too, would make the silent walk to Nashville's City Hall. And, when Nashville's own lunch counters were desegregated, he would leave with a group of Freedom Riders and be arrested at a lunch counter in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n'Long overdue'\n\nA project honoring all those who participated in the city's civil rights movement has been long overdue, he said.\n\n\"I think, to be quite honest with you, when it comes to the history I think Nashville is a little bit behind,\" said Patton, who served on the selection committee that chose Hood's Witness Walls. \"We focus more on country music. You have to go other places — Memphis and Atlanta — to see about the civil rights history of Nashville and the changes that were made as a result of the 60s.\"\n\nWitness Walls remembers that movement and makes it relevant again.\n\n\"We knew we wanted to make a change,\" he said. \"It wasn't about us. It was about the generations to come.\"\n\nNow, those generations are here.\n\nCELEBRATE THE UNVEILING OF WITNESS WALLS\n\nWitness Walls is inspired by the events and people who created the blueprint for nonviolent protest during the modern Civil Rights Movement.\n\nNashville Mayor Megan Barry, Witness Walls artist and creator Walter Hood, and community leaders will join the Metro Arts Commission for the public dedication to honor those who fought for racial equality and continue the important conversation about social justice in our community.\n\nWhen: 2 p.m., Friday\n\nWhere: Nashville's Public Square Park at the Historic Metro Courthouse (Corner of 3rd Avenue North and James Robertson Parkway)\n\nMore info: www.witnesswalls.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/18"}]}

According to his LinkedIn profile, Boelter lived and worked in Wisconsin for a time. However, other media reports have cast doubt on the veracity of some of his claims about his professional and personal history.\n\nHere's what we know about his possible ties to Wisconsin:\n\nMinnesota shooting suspect says he attended Cardinal Strich University in Wisconsin\n\nOn his LinkedIn profile, Boelter is listed as obtaining a master's of science in management degree, and a doctorate in leadership for the advancement of learning and service from Cardinal Stritch University.\n\nThe school, founded by the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi, was located in Fox Point. It permanently closed in 2023 amid financial struggle.\n\nBoelter reportedly earned his undergraduate degree from Minnesota's St. Cloud State University. He studied from 2008 to 2010 for his master's, and 2011 to 2016 for his doctorate.\n\nVance Boelter reportedly worked at Johnsonville for a time\n\nBoelter's LinkedIn profile also lists him as working as an operations leader at Johnsonville, the Sheboygan Falls-based sausage company, from 2004 to 2008. Johnsonville is the largest sausage brand by revenue in the United States.\n\nVance Boelter reportedly was the CEO of 'Red Lion Group'\n\nBoelter said on LinkedIn he was the CEO of a company called Red Lion Group, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It's not clear what the company did. The website linked to his LinkedIn profile for Red Lion Group is currently down.\n\nTwo years ago, he wrote on LinkedIn he was \"currently in the Democratic Republic of Congo working on several projects.\" He added, \"Red Lion Group had a great meeting with the new Governor of Congo Central to talk about our private business projects that are all moving forward.\"\n\nJust last month, Boelter has a post that says he was looking to get back into the U.S. food industry or other leadership positions outside of this line of work.\n\nWhat happened in Minnesota?\n\nBoelter is accused of launching what Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called a \"politically motivated assassination.\"\n\nPolice say he posed as a law enforcement officer on June 14 and fatally shot state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home in Brooklyn Park. He also shot and wounded State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home, authorities said.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, said in an interview with the New York Times that the gunman had a notebook with a list of names that included hers and those of other lawmakers, all of whom were Democrats.\n\nThe list included about 70 potential targets, a federal law enforcement official said, including doctors, community and business leaders, and locations for Planned Parenthood and other health care centers. Some of the targets were in neighboring states.\n\nWhere was Vance Boelter found?\n\nPolice arrested Boelter after a search in Sibley County, about an hour’s drive away from the site of the attacks, where they found a car belonging to Boelter on a remote stretch of road.\n\nThe massive manhunt focused on Sibley County because Boelter has a residence just outside Green Isle, a small community with a population of about 520, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBoelter surrendered to law enforcement officers in a wooded area near his Green Isle home.\n\nWhere is Sibley County?\n\nSibley County is in south-central Minnesota.

Tim Walz called a “politically motivated assassination,\" was taken into custody, authorities announced Sunday night.\n\nThe suspect, identified by authorities as Vance Luther Boelter, 57, was taken into custody in rural Sibley County, about 50 miles away from Minneapolis, according to Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Boelter has a residence just outside the small community of Green Isle, which is located in Sibley County.\n\nBoelter was arrested after state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed, and State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and wounded in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, two neighboring suburban cities 10 to 20 miles outside Minneapolis.\n\nAuthorities searched Sibley County after receiving information that Boelter was seen in the area, Evans said at a news conference late Sunday night. The suspect faces state charges in connection with the two deaths and two attempted murders.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office is reviewing whether the suspect will face federal charges, according to Evans.\n\nBoelter had posed as a law enforcement officer to gain access to the Minneapolis-area victims' homes in the pre-dawn hours on Saturday, officials said. Authorities said he and police officers exchanged gunfire before he fled on foot.\n\nBob Jacobson, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said Boelter “exploited the trust our uniforms are meant to represent\" and that it was \"deeply disturbing to those of us who wear the badge with honor and responsibility.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz remembers shooting victims\n\nWalz praised law enforcement for the capture of the suspect and condemned the killing of Hortman during the Sunday night news conference.\n\n\"Melissa Hortman was the core of who our values were. She had a hand in so many things that happened,\" Walz said. \"To Melissa and Mark's family: Cannot fathom your pain and the grief that you're going through. We'll take solace in the memory and the work that Melissa did, and you can rest assured that we will put every ounce of effort that the state of Minnesota has to make sure that justice is served.\"\n\nWalz also credited the Hoffmans’ daughter for her \"heroic actions,\" which \"saved countless lives.\" The New York Times reported that charging documents showed that a child of the Hoffmans called 911.\n\nIn an update, Walz said John Hoffman had finished his final surgery and is \"moving towards recovery\" while Yvette Hoffman is \"healing.\"\n\nLocal police chief: 'The largest manhunt in the state's history'\n\nBrooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley called the search for Boelter \"the largest manhunt in the state's history.\"\n\nHundreds of law enforcement members participated in the search, officials said at the news conference late Sunday. Bruley said there were 20 different SWAT teams over an \"extremely large area hunting\" the suspect.\n\nThe FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the U.S. Marshals Service also assisted state and local law enforcement in the search, officials said.\n\nMinnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger and Evans said the suspect, who was armed, \"crawled\" to law enforcement and was placed under arrest. Geiger added that no force was used in the arrest.\n\nLocal sheriff's office confirms suspect's arrest\n\nThe Ramsey County Sheriff's Office confirmed that the suspect was arrested following a massive manhunt on Sunday night. The arrest comes after Minnesota officials requested the public's help in the case, which put the state on edge over the shocking political violence.\n\n\"The face of evil. After relentless and determined police work, the killer is now in custody,\" the sheriff's office said on Facebook. \"Thanks to the dedication of multiple agencies working together, along with support from the community, justice is one step closer.\"\n\nState House Speaker Lisa Demuth said on X that she was \"grateful that this nightmare has come to an end with the suspect captured so he can be charged, prosecuted, & punished for the horror he has wrought on MN.\"\n\nMinnesota AG says he is on the suspect's list found by police\n\nSpeaking on NBC's \"Politics Nation\" on Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he is on the list found in the notebook that appeared to include the names of lawmakers and other officials.\n\n\"He had a list. He had a lot of people on the list,\" Ellison said on \"Politics Nation.\" \"He murdered my dear friend Melissa Hortman, who was on that list, and shot down my other dear friend John Hoffman who was on that list along with their spouses.\"\n\nThe attorney general underscored that local lawmakers and officials were not \"intimidated\" by the suspect. He also noted that the public must denounce the current climate of political violence across the country and called the shootings an \"act of an evil individual who committed an evil, heinous, cowardly act.\"\n\n\"We are standing firm. We're standing strong,\" Ellison added. \"Our resolve in our beliefs around liberty and justice for all are as strong as ever, and this guy cannot intimidate us.\"\n\nInvestigators urged the public not to speculate on the case\n\nDuring a news conference Sunday afternoon, Evans urged the public not to speculate on “what the motivation was for this.” Authorities previously said it appeared Boelter targeted legislators who are abortion rights supporters, based on writings he left behind.\n\nEvans clarified at the news conference that the writings investigators found were not in the form of a \"traditional manifesto\" and lacked details. They have not yet released those writings.\n\n\"This is a notebook — with a lot of that's been reported — of lawmakers and others that are listed in here,\" Evans said. \"And then much more other thoughts that are throughout this, as opposed to a very succinct document ... and it's mixed in with other documents.\"\n\nUnclear whether the suspect traveled by foot, vehicle\n\nThe suspect in the attacks had been seen earlier Saturday wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, a dark-colored long-sleeved collared shirt or coat with a dark bag, police said. The FBI also released photos of the suspect wearing a rubber mask and a police-like uniform at the time of the shooting, and offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information that could lead to an arrest.\n\nOn Sunday, Evans said investigators did not know whether the suspect was traveling on foot or by a vehicle. He added that there is currently no evidence that the suspect has a specific destination in mind. It was unclear whether Boelter had received assistance from anyone, though it appeared he \"has certainly been in contact\" with people, Evans added.\n\nInformation on the suspect has been shared with other neighboring states, including South Dakota, Evans said.\n\n\"We have not located any prior threats with this individual towards anybody,\" Evans said. \"That will obviously be part (of a) deeper dive to really understand the motivation of this individual.\"\n\nAuthorities search in rural area near suspect's listed home address\n\nEarlier on Sunday, a vehicle associated with Boelter was found in Sibley County. Authorities also discovered a hat that the suspect was believed to be wearing in the area, according to Evans. He said those developments led authorities to believe Boelter was in the Sibley County area.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday declined to specify the type of vehicle found in rural Sibley County and warned area residents to lock their doors and vehicles as police searched the area. The location of the vehicle was about four miles east of Boelter's listed home address near Green Isle, a small city of around 600 people in Sibley County, according to Reuters.\n\nGreen Isle Mayor Shane Sheets previously told USA TODAY that Boelter lived just outside of the city.\n\n\"Suspect not located. Keep your doors locked and vehicles secured,\" warns the alert, as read to USA TODAY by a Sibley County emergency dispatcher.\n\nAuthorities previously said the suspect's wife was stopped on Saturday morning, about 120 miles away from where his vehicle was found. At the news conference Sunday, Evans said investigators met with Boelter’s family, including his wife, and added that Boelter's family members were not in custody.\n\nShooting victim 'closer to every hour to being out of the woods'\n\nIn a text message shared on Facebook by U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar late Sunday afternoon, Hoffman's wife, Yvette, said the senator is undergoing multiple surgeries after being shot nine times.\n\nHoffman \"is closer to every hour to being out of the woods,\" Yvette Hoffman said in the text message.\n\n\"I took 8 and we are both incredibly lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman added. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Klobuchar told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she had seen both Hortman and Hoffman at a political dinner on Friday, just hours before they were shot. She said both Hoffmans were \"hanging in there\" after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nWalz: 'This was an act of targeted political violence'\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension officially named Boelter as a suspect in the case. Authorities have not yet publicly released what they believe motivated Boelter, but many Minnesota elected officials repeatedly called the attacks politically motivated.\n\nInvestigators said they found in Boelter's vehicle a list of \"many lawmakers and other officials,\" and Hoffman and Hortman were both on it. They declined to specify whether the list identified specifically Democrats or just elected officials in general.\n\n\"This was an act of targeted political violence,\" Walz said at a news conference. \"We have demonstrated again and again in our state that it is possible to peacefully disagree, that our state is strengthened by civil public debate. We must stand united against all forms of violence − and I call on everyone to join me in that commitment.\"\n\nMinnesota suspect's wife found by authorities Saturday\n\nThe sheriff in Mille Lacs County said his deputies on Saturday morning assisted with a traffic stop of a vehicle in which the suspect's wife, Jenny Lynne Boelter, was riding.\n\nSheriff Kyle A. Burton told USA TODAY that deputies assisted with the stop of the vehicle in which Jenny Lynne Boelter and other relatives were riding near a convenience store in Onamia, about 65 miles north of where the shootings occurred.\n\n\"We did not search or question any of the occupants,\" Burton said. \"I was told by my staff who responded that the shooting suspect's wife was in the car along with several other relatives.\"\n\nBurton said law enforcement from Hennepin County, where the shootings occurred, made the initial stop, and that his deputies provided perimeter security.\n\nHow did the Minnesota shooting suspect get victims to open their doors?\n\nJacobson said the suspect's disguise was effective because it so closely mirrored what real law enforcement officers wear. Investigators said Boelter was wearing a uniform with a badge and driving an SUV equipped to look like a real patrol vehicle.\n\n\"The suspect exploited the trust of our uniforms, that our uniforms are meant to represent,\" Jacobson said. \"That betrayal is deeply disturbing to those of us who wear the badge with honor and responsibility.\"\n\nBrooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said the vehicle looked \"exactly like\" a police vehicle, and that Boelter was wearing a tactical vest and carrying both a handgun and a Taser.\n\nKlobuchar said the suspect appeared to be wearing a full-face mask that disguised his appearance, along with police-style equipment and uniform. Boelter is listed as a director of security patrols on the website for Praetorian Guard Security Services.\n\n\"No question that if they were in this room you would assume that they are a police officer,\" Bruley said.\n\nSuspect told friend he 'might be dead soon'\n\nDavid Carlson, 59, told Reuters that he had been sharing a house in Minneapolis with Boelter, whom he had known since the fourth grade, for a little more than a year. He last saw him on Friday night and received a text from Boelter at about 6 a.m. on Saturday.\n\n\"He said that he might be dead soon,\" said Carlson, who called the police.\n\nWho is Vance Luther Boelter?\n\nBoelter is a St. Cloud State University graduate, according to SCSU spokesperson Zach Dwyer. Boelter wrote on his LinkedIn page that he was the CEO of a company called \"Red Lion Group\" and that he had traveled to Congo and several other countries, but those claims have not been confirmed.\n\nBoelter is also listed on a website of a company called Praetorian Guard Security Services, which lists him as director of security patrols. The website describes him as involved with \"security situations\" overseas, including Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nPraetorian Guard Security Services, a residential armed home security company in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, listed Boelter as director of security patrols for the company, according to its website.\n\nThe company offered licensed armed security patrols, uniformed security, and event security, with the latter service coming soon.\n\n\"We drive the same make and model of vehicles that many police departments use in the U.S.,\" the website said. \"Currently, we drive Ford Explorer Utility Vehicles.\"\n\nIn 2019, Walz named Boelter and dozens of others to his Governor’s Workforce Development Board, which according to the governor's website assists the governor in \"developing, implementing, and modifying the state plan, review of statewide policies and programs, providing recommendations on actions to align and improve the workforce development system and programs,\" and other state matters.\n\nWho were the victims of the shootings in Minnesota?\n\nHoffman and Hortman are both members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Hoffman, 60, and his wife, Yvette, have one child and live in Champlin, according to his lawmaker profile. He was first elected in 2012. Hortman and her husband, Mark, have two children and live in Brooklyn Park, according to her profile. She was elected in 2004.\n\nThe Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) is a political party exclusive to Minnesota, formed in 1944 when the Minnesota Democratic Party and the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged.\n\nHortman was Speaker-Emerita of the House of Representatives, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans.\n\nHortman served her constituents with compassion and grace, Walz said.\n\n\"Our state lost a great leader and I lost the dearest of friends, he said. \"She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place.\"\n\nPolitical violence in the United States remains a concern\n\nThe shootings are the latest in a spate of political violence across the United States. President Donald Trump has faced two assassination attempts, including being shot in the ear last July. Earlier this year, a man set fire to the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro over the Gaza war.\n\nPolitical experts have warned that the heated discourse in the United States risks further violence, though it's been ongoing for years. In 2011, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was injured in a shooting that killed six people at a constituent meeting. And in 2017, a gunman wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, during a congressional baseball practice.\n\nA congressional committee earlier this year noted that the gunman in that shooting, which also wounded two Capitol police officers, was carrying a list with the names and descriptions of six members of Congress, including two Republicans who were attending practice that day.\n\nHow did Minnesota shooting suspect attack lawmakers?\n\nAccording to authorities, police were called to a shooting around 2 a.m. on June 14 at the Hoffmans' home in Champlin. The Hoffmans had been shot and wounded and were transported to a hospital, where they underwent surgery, officials said. Walz said they are \"cautiously optimistic\" that the Hoffmans will survive.\n\nAuthorities said that while police were responding to the Hoffmans' house, officers in neighboring Brooklyn Park, who were helping on the scene, decided to check on Hortman. When they arrived at Hortman's home, they saw what appeared to be a police vehicle with lights on and encountered a man dressed as an officer coming out of the home.\n\nPolice exchanged gunfire with the man, who ran back inside and fled out the back door, authorities said.\n\n\"Political violence is evil. It cannot be tolerated, and neither can those who condone it or make excuses for it,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci and Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/06/maryland-high-school-shooting-bathroom/75109753007/", "title": "Maryland high school shooting: 15-year-old killed in bathroom", "text": "A Maryland high school student shot his fellow classmate on Friday, killing the 15-year-old just two days after a Georgia school shooting left four victims dead.\n\nThe 16-year-old assailant fired a single shot at the younger boy, Warren Curtis Grant, in a men's bathroom at Joppatowne High School on Friday afternoon, Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said at a news conference.

Officials identified the three now-deceased inmates as Saul Alvarez, Thorne Harnage and Donald Lashley.\n\nThe causes of the inmate's deaths were not released as officials said an investigation is currently ongoing. Alvarez was incarcerated for first-degree murder, while Lashly and Harnage were both serving time for child sex offenses, according to the ADCRR.\n\n“Preliminary reports suggest that inmate Wassenaar acted with intent to harm the three men named above. There is no evidence to suggest any ongoing threat,” officials said in the news release.\n\nWhy is Wassenaar in prison?\n\nA man with an extensive criminal record dating back to 1986, Wassenaar is currently serving 16 life sentences in connection to a 2004 attempted prison escape with another inmate, Steven Coy. The two men took two prison guards captive in what would become one of the longest prison standoffs in the history of the United States.\n\nBefore the 2004 standoff, Wassenaar was serving a 28-year prison sentence he was handed in 1997 for eight counts of aggravated assault and one count of armed robbery, all of which he committed while under house arrest for another crime he was convicted of back in 1986.\n\nRecords from the Arizona Department of Corrections show that Wassenaar has committed multiple violations while in prison. Wassenaar violated disciplinary rules at least 27 times while incarcerated before the incident late last week, records show.\n\nWhat happened in 2004?\n\nIn 2004, Wassenaar and his cellmate, Steven Coy, attempted to escape the Lewis Prison complex in Buckeye, Arizona. According to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, both men tried to escape by going through the prison's kitchen, then the arsenal tower, before leaving through the administration building.\n\n\"I've got nothing to lose, and this is an escape,\" Wassenaar reportedly told an officer, according to Arizona Republic archives.\n\nIn the early morning hours when inexperienced corrections officers were on duty, the two inmates fled the kitchen, raping, assaulting and tying up two workers while en route to the tower. They made it to the watchtower but were trapped as several officers surrounded it.\n\nThe pair took two correctional officers hostage, one of whom was a mother. Both men sexually assaulted her on the first day. The other officer suffered head injuries, according to Arizona Republic archives.\n\nNegotiations lasted more than two weeks. Eventually, Wassenaar surrendered after being promised a transfer to the Midwest and Coy also gave himself up, thus ending the 15-day hostage situation. Both hostages survived.\n\nWassenaar was convicted in 2005 on 19 charges, including kidnapping, dangerous or deadly assault by prisoner, aggravated assault, sexual assault and first-degree escape for his involvement in the 2004 hostage situation, according to the ADCRR.\n\nContributing: Rey Covarrubias Jr. and Lauren De Young/ The Arizona Republic\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

But after hours of \"coercive interrogation,\" four of the boys agreed to provide written and videotaped statements admitting to being present during the assaults, the lawsuit reads.\n\nOn May 1, 1989, 11 days after the assault and rape of Meili in Central Park, Trump published a full-page advertisement in four New York City newspapers alluding to the crimes. The advertisement did not identify the suspects, but called for the city of New York to \"[s]end a message loud and clear to those who would murder our citizens and terrorize New York—BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY AND BRING BACK OUR POLICE!”\n\n“I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer... I want to hate these murderers and I always will... I am looking to punish them... I want them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid,\" Trump wrote in the advertisement, per the lawsuit.\n\nTrump did not apologize for comments in post-debate spin room\n\nImmediately following the debate on Sept. 10, Trump passed through the spin room to answer questions from attendees, including Yusef Salaam, the lawsuit reads. During this post-debate event, the Republican presidential nominee was asked, \"Will you apologize to the Exonerated Five?” and “Sir, what do you say to a member of the Central Park Five, sir?”\n\nTrump allegedly did not respond to the question, which prompted Salaam to say, \"President Trump, I’m Yusef Salaam, one of the Exonerated Five. How are you doing?” Trump responded, “Ah, you’re on my side then.” Salaam then said, \"No, no, no, I’m not on your side.”\n\nTrump would then wave his hand at Salaam, smile and walk, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Plaintiff Salaam was attempting to politely dialogue with Defendant Trump about the false and defamatory statements that Defendant Trump had made about Plaintiffs less than an hour earlier, but Defendant Trump refused to engage with him in dialogue,\" the lawsuit alleges.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/21"}]}

Legislature", "text": "Nicholas Pugliese\n\nState House Bureau, @nickpugz\n\nAn Assembly tourism panel advanced a pair of bills Monday that would impose new taxes and regulations on short-term housing rentals such as those provided through the online marketplaces Airbnb and FlipKey.\n\nMore than a dozen other legislative committees also considered measures covering topics ranging from college fees and vaping to psychiatric beds and a designer drug known as “flakka.”\n\nAirbnb is the most prominent of numerous online services that allow people to rent out a room in their home or their entire residence to tourists, business people and other travelers on a short-term basis. Advocates say the services gives property owners a form of supplemental income while also expanding lodging options available to travelers.\n\nRelated story: N.J. towns, state government move to regulate short-term rentals\n\nRelated story: Ban on flavors would leave some vapers bitter\n\nCritics of the services, however, say that the short-term-rental industry is hurting hotels and the housing market, and officials in more than a dozen municipalities in North Jersey have moved since July to restrict short-term rentals over concerns that they were eroding the quality of life in some neighborhoods.\n\nMore than 6,000 New Jersey residents hosted 257,000 guests using Airbnb in 2016, a press secretary for the company said Monday, and 325,000 residents used the service to travel domestically and abroad.\n\nA bill sponsored by Assemblywomen Valerie Vainieri Huttle, D-Englewood, and Annette Quijano, D-Union, would impose the same sales and use taxes on short-term rentals as imposed on other hotels and motels in the state.\n\nPeter Schottenfels, a press secretary for Airbnb, testified in favor of the legislation Monday. He said the company has “voluntary collection agreements” with more than 230 jurisdictions around the world, including Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Jersey City, and that the bill would have generated $6 million in state and local taxes in New Jersey had it been in effect in 2016.\n\nThe Assembly Tourism, Gaming and the Arts Committee approved the bill Monday by a 5-2 vote.\n\nA separate bill sponsored by Huttle goes further and seeks to establish a statewide regulatory framework for short-term rentals where none currently exists. It would codify that municipalities are authorized to prohibit such rentals and would require anyone who wants to offer a short-term rental to first register with their municipality, among other restrictions.\n\n“The current practices of short-term rental businesses lack the necessary safety precautions for our municipalities,” Huttle said in a statement after the same Assembly panel voted unanimously to advance the bill.\n\nSchottenfels, on the other hand, testified that the bill would “usurp local control by imposing a top-down solution” and called it “a solution in search of a problem.”\n\nSenate versions of the bills have not been introduced.\n\nOther highlights of Monday’s committee hearings included:\n\nVaping\n\nAn Assembly health panel voted 7-2 with two abstentions to advance a bill that would ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes except for tobacco, clove and menthol flavors.\n\nThe legislation, which advanced out of a Senate committee in May, has pitted anti-smoking advocates, who say that many flavored electronic smoking products are targeted at children, against vaping enthusiasts, who say that their habit had enabled them to quit smoking tobacco cigarettes while still getting a nicotine hit.\n\nCurrent law prohibits the sale or distribution of cigarettes that have a characterizing flavor other than tobacco, clove, or menthol, but that prohibition does not apply to electronic smoking devices, cartridges or other components, including liquid refills, according to the bill’s sponsors.\n\nCollege fees\n\nThe Assembly Higher Education Committee advanced a measure that seeks to add transparency to how public and for-profit degree-granting institutions in New Jersey determine their mandatory student fees.\n\nThe bill would also require all colleges and universities in the state to provide a financial aid “shopping sheet” to each prospective student as part of its financial aid process. The sheet would include information about graduation rates, costs and expected debt.\n\nA Senate version of the bill, which is based on recommendations from the state comptroller in a 2016 report, passed unanimously in the Senate in May.\n\nOpen space\n\nA Senate environment panel voted to advance a bill that would appropriate $59.5 million to the state Department of Environmental Protection to help fund the acquisition or development of land for recreation and preservation, including as part of the state’s Blue Acres program.\n\nThe money comes from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax revenues, an arrangement that state voters approved in a 2014 referendum. Numerous municipalities, historical sites and programs in North Jersey stand to benefit from the latest round of funding.\n\nAn Assembly version of the bill has yet to receive a hearing in committee.\n\nPsychiatric treatment beds\n\nThe Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee advanced a bill that would eliminate the lengthy, state-controlled process by which health care facilities can obtain approval to develop treatment beds for patients with both a psychiatric and a substance use disorder.\n\nUntil this month, the state had not issued what is known as a “certificate of need call” for adult acute care psychiatric beds in more than a decade. Advocates have said a lack of such beds has stymied the state’s efforts to respond to a growing epidemic of opioid and heroin use.\n\nThe bill is still in committee in the Assembly.\n\nMedication-assisted substance abuse treatment\n\nA Senate health panel voted unanimously to advance a bill that would prohibit residential substance abuse treatment facilities and after-care facilities, including sober living homes and halfway houses, from denying admission to patients because they are also receiving medication-assisted treatment for a substance use disorder.\n\nAn Assembly version of the bill has yet to be introduced.\n\nTransportation projects\n\nThe Senate Transportation Committee advanced a measure that would require the state Department of Transportation to compensate local governments for any delay damages they incurred when many transportation projects were temporary put on hold last summer during a standoff between Christie and the Legislature over funding for the Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nThe bill was approved by the Assembly in May by a vote of 53-13 with eight abstentions.\n\n'Flakka'\n\nThe possession or sale of the designer drug known as “flakka” or “flocka” would be criminalized under a bill advanced by the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee. The substance is related to “bath salts” and frequently marketed as a legal alternative to cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy, according to the bill.\n\nThe measure is awaiting a committee hearing in the Senate.\n\nEmail: pugliese@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/27"}]}

In some cases, they told him to his face that his information was wrong.\n\nTestimony to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has revealed that it wasn’t only journalists, elections officials and Democrats who were rejecting Trump’s lies about what happened in the election he lost but claimed to win. People Trump selected for important positions, from his campaign manager to the US attorney general, were also saying – mostly in private – that Trump’s fraud allegations were baseless.\n\nThe January 6 hearings are ongoing, and the public has only seen committee-selected video clips of certain former officials’ testimony. We know that some other figures in Trump’s orbit were joining him in promoting lies about the election, not rejecting those lies.\n\nBut the hearings have already shown that Trump’s government appointees or people on his campaign dismissed at least 10 of his false claims – from the overarching lie that the election was stolen to various specific tales about what happened in swing states he lost.\n\nHere’s a list.\n\n1) The false claim of a ‘stolen’ election\n\nTrump has incessantly repeated the false claim that the election was stolen from him – baselessly insisting that he would have been returned to the White House if not for massive fraud and other nefarious Democratic behavior.\n\nBut William Barr, who served as attorney general under Trump, testified to the committee: “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the President was bullshit.” Barr testified that “my opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud.”\n\nRichard Donoghue, who served as principal associate deputy attorney general and then as acting deputy attorney general, also testified that claims of major fraud were untrue – and that he told Trump directly: “I said something to the effect of, ‘Sir, we’ve done dozens of investigations, hundreds of interviews. The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. We’ve looked at Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. We’re doing our job. Much of the info you’re getting is false.’”\n\nJeffrey Rosen, who served as deputy attorney general and then briefly, after Barr’s resignation in December 2020, as acting attorney general, said that when Trump would cite a supposed election impropriety, claiming that “people are telling me this” or “I heard this” or “I saw on television,” they could correct him: “We were in a position to say, ‘Our people already looked at that. And we know that you’re getting bad information. That’s – that’s not correct. It’s been demonstrated to be incorrect from our point of view. It’s been debunked.”\n\nDerek Lyons, who was White House staff secretary and counselor to Trump, testified that, at a meeting about a month and a half after Election Day, top White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Eric Herschmann “told the group, the President included, that, you know, none of those allegations had been substantiated to the point where they could be the basis for any litigation challenge to the election.”\n\nAlex Cannon, who was a lawyer for the Trump campaign, testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in November 2020 that he had not found “anything sufficient to alter the results of the election” and that he had told White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on a November 2020 call that “we weren’t finding anything that would be sufficient to change the results in any of the key states.”\n\nMatt Morgan, who was the Trump campaign’s general counsel, testified that, as of early January 2021, he and top Pence advisers – chief of staff Marc Short and attorney Greg Jacob – were in agreement that even “if aggregated and read most favorably to the campaign,” election “fraud, maladministration, abuse or irregularities” were “not sufficient to be outcome-determinative.”\n\n2) The false claim that Trump had won on Election Night\n\nTrump falsely claimed in a speech on Election Night that he had won the election because he had leads in the vote counts in several key states. Trump used similar language in his rally speech on January 6, 2021 – claiming that “our election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening,” when the vote counts showed him leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, but “then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit.”\n\nBut it was clear to other key figures in Trump’s orbit – as it was to millions of others – that his leads in the early Election Night count, as millions of votes remained uncounted, did not mean he had won. Bill Stepien, who was Trump’s campaign manager, testified that Election Night was “too early to call the race”: “It was far too early to be making any calls like that. Ballots – ballots were still being counted. Ballots were still going to be counted for days.”\n\nStepien said he had explained to Trump that early returns would be “positive,” but they would then have a long night waiting for the counting of additional ballots. The fact that states’ vote counts got worse for Trump as the hours went by, Barr said, was not indicative of fraud: Barr noted that “people had been talking for weeks, and everyone understood for weeks, that that was going to be what happened on Election Night.”\n\nIndeed, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, testified that people at the White House on Election Night were a little nervous to see what would happen with “the red wave or the red mirage.” Red mirage was a term media outlets had been citing for months to explain that early results would almost certainly be misleadingly favorable to Trump because it would take time for states to count the mail-in ballots Trump had warned his own supporters against using.\n\nMiller testified that he recalled saying on Election Night “that we should not go and declare victory until we had a better sense of the numbers.” Ivanka Trump, Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, testified that she didn’t know if she had held a “firm view” about what Trump should say on Election Night, but she added, “The results were still being counted. It was becoming clear that the race would not be called on Election Night.”\n\n3) A false claim about fraudulent totals in Philadelphia\n\nTrump tweeted in December 2020 that there were “MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS” in Philadelphia. He repeated that claim in a January 2022 interview with NPR, though he phrased it as a question.\n\nBarr testified that the claim was “absolute rubbish.” (In reality, about two-thirds of Philadelphia’s registered voters cast a ballot in the 2020 election.) Barr added: “The turnout in Philadelphia was in line with the state’s turnout and in fact it was not as – as impressive as many suburban counties. And there was nothing strange about the Philadelphia turnout. It wasn’t like there was all these unexpected votes that came out in Philadelphia.”\n\n4) A false claim about absentee ballots in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump tweeted in late November 2020 to promote a graphic that suggested Pennsylvania had recorded far more mail-in votes in the general election than the number of mail-in ballots it had actually distributed to voters. Trump added, “The 1,126,940 votes were created out of thin air.”\n\nBut the graphic was plain wrong; the supposed 1,126,940 extra votes did not exist at all, as Pennsylvania journalists quickly explained. The graphic – which had been posted by Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, now the Republican gubernatorial nominee – improperly contrasted numbers from the November 2020 general election with numbers from the state’s June 2020 primaries.\n\nBarr explained in his testimony that Mastriano had been comparing apples to oranges. “Once you actually go and look and compare apples to apples, there’s no discrepancy at all,” he said.\n\n5) A false claim about a truckload of ballots being driven from New York to Pennsylvania\n\nIn December 2020, Trump tweeted out a video clip featuring a Fox interview with a truck driver who claimed he had been unwittingly used in a scheme to transport numerous completed mail-in ballots from New York to Pennsylvania.\n\nDonoghue testified that he told Trump: “I essentially said, ‘Look, we looked at that allegation. We looked at both ends, both the people who load the truck and the people unload the truck. And that allegation was not supported by the evidence.”\n\n6) False claims about Dominion voting technology\n\nTrump and some of his allies made multiple false claims about the election technology provided by a company called Dominion Voting Systems. They inaccurately alleged that Dominion technology had switched Trump votes to Biden votes in large numbers and that Dominion was a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. (Dominion is pursuing a series of defamation lawsuits over such claims; the company was actually founded in Canada, is not connected to Chavez, and did not flip or otherwise manipulate 2020 votes.)\n\nBarr testified: “I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations, but they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people, members of the public, that there was this systemic corruption in the system and that their votes didn’t count and that these machines controlled by somebody else were actually determining it, which was complete nonsense. And it was being laid out there. And I told them that it was – that it was crazy stuff and they were wasting their time on that. And it was doing a great, grave disservice to the country.”\n\nBarr added of Trump and Dominion: “And I was somewhat demoralized because I thought, boy, if he really believes this stuff he has, you know, lost contact with – with – he’s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff.” Barr also said of Trump: “There was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.”\n\nCannon testified that he told Trump adviser Peter Navarro in mid-November 2020 that he “didn’t believe the Dominion allegations.” And Herschmann dismissed various theories put forward by lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted a variety of conspiracy theories about election technology and foreign interference. (Powell is one of the people being sued by Dominion.) Herschmann called at least one theory “completely nuts” – it wasn’t clear in the clip shown by the committee which theory he was referring to – and scoffed at claims about “Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelans.”\n\n7) A false claim about Dominion machines in Michigan\n\nTrump tweeted in December 2020 to claim that there was a “68% error rate in Michigan Voting Machines” – exaggerating a conspiratorial consultant’s finding, about a single Michigan county, that was itself quickly debunked by Michigan media.\n\nDonoghue, too, rejected the “68% error rate” claim. He testified of a conversation with Trump: “And then I went into, for instance, this thing from Michigan, this report about ’68% error rate.’ Reality is it was only 0.0063% error rate, less than 1 in 15,000. So the President accepted that. He said, ‘OK, fine, but what about the others?’”\n\n8) A false claim about non-citizens voting in Arizona\n\nTrump falsely claimed in his January 6, 2021, rally speech that, in Arizona, “over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens.”\n\nStepien testified that the claim that “thousands of illegal citizens, people not eligible to vote” had cast Arizona ballots was a “wild claim” that “on its face didn’t seem, you know, realistic or possible to me.” He said that after asking Cannon to look into the claim, it turned out “the reality of that was not illegal citizens voting in the election” but rather that the votes were cast by “people who were eligible to vote.”\n\n9) The false story about election workers in Georgia\n\nTrump and some of his allies, notably including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, repeatedly made false claims about fraud they insisted had been committed by elections workers in Fulton County, Georgia, home to Atlanta. Trump declared in his January 6, 2021, rally speech that workers had pulled “suitcases of ballots out from under a table” and illegally scanned “tens of thousands of votes.”\n\nDonoghue testified that he debunked the claim at length to Trump: “The President kept fixating on this suitcase that supposedly had fraudulent ballots and that the suitcase was rolled out from under the table. And I said, ‘No sir, there is no suitcase.’ You can watch that video over and over. There is no suitcase. There is a wheeled bin where they carry the ballots, and that’s just how they move ballots around that facility. There’s nothing suspicious about that at all. I told him that there was no multiple scanning of the ballots – one of the – one part of that allegation was that they were taking one ballot and scanning it through three or four or five times to rack up votes, presumably for Vice President Biden. I told him that the video did not support that.”\n\nByung “BJay” Pak, a Trump-appointed former US attorney in Georgia who was previously a Republican state legislator, testified that the supposed “suitcase” was actually an “official lockbox” for storing ballots at that facility and that the full video disproved the fraud claims Giuliani had tried to promote by showing Georgia legislators a limited section of the footage. Pak, who resigned in January 2021, testified: “We interviewed – the FBI interviewed – the individuals that are depicted in the videos, that purportedly were double, triple counting of the ballots, and determined that nothing irregular happened in the counting, and the allegations made by Mr. Giuliani were false.”\n\n10) The false claim that “2000 Mules” proves the election was rigged\n\nTrump has seized on a movie called “2000 Mules,” made by a right-wing filmmaker, that claims to contain proof of a major fraudulent scheme involving Democrats and the submission of mail-in ballots at drop boxes. Trump has suggested that the movie proves his assertion that the election was rigged.\n\nBut similar to numerous others who have pointed out major holes in “2000 Mules,” Barr described the movie’s purported cell phone evidence as “singularly unimpressive,” said its purported photo evidence was “lacking,” and noted that it “didn’t establish widespread illegal harvesting” of ballots.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/15/trump-indictment-live-updates-president-georgia/70594010007/", "title": "Donald Trump indicted in Georgia case with Republican allies: recap", "text": "A grand jury in Georgia indicted Donald Trump late Monday night, accusing the former president and a slate of allies of trying to steal President Joe Biden’s win in the state during the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe indictment is made up of 41 charges against 19 defendants, from Trump to his former attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nTrump and his presidential campaign criticized the charges, calling them politically motivated as the former president seeks his second term in office.\n\nHere’s a recap of what you need to know about Trump’s indictment in Georgia – his fourth set of criminal charges.\n\nWhat's the case against Donald Trump and his Republican allies?\n\nThe legal case centers on Georgia's RICO statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That kind of measure typically targets people engaged in organized crime.\n\nTakeaways from Trump Georgia indictment: RICO charges, false statements and Kanye’s publicist\n\nRepublican candidates take low-key approach to Donald Trump's latest indictment\n\nSo far, most of Trump's Republican opponents have had a muted reaction to the Atlanta indictment.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has often criticized prosecutors more than Trump, did so again in a conference call with New England reporters: \"I think it's an example of this criminalization of politics. I don't think this is something that's good for the country.\"\n\nEven Chris Christie, normally Trump's fiercest critic on legal issues, said the Georgia indictment is too much like the federal election case filed earlier this month by Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\"Most of the time what you’d see here would be a state court deferring to a federal prosecution, especially if that federal indictment had already been issued,\" Christie told Fox News. \"So, I think this was unnecessary, as to Donald Trump.\"\n\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who has been more congenial to Trump, said \"the four prosecutions against Trump are using novel and untested legal theories,\" including the Georgia case.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., during an appearance at the Iowa State Fair, also defended Trump by saying \"we've seen the legal system being weaponized against political opponents.\"\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has also been critical of Trump, said after the Atlanta indictment: \"Over a year ago, I said that Donald Trump's actions disqualified him from ever serving as President again. Those words are more true today than ever before.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nThe 2020 election was not stolen: Brian Kemp knocks Donald Trump on false claims\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp again criticized Trump for promoting false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, saying in a social media post Tuesday that \"the 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen.\"\n\n\"For nearly three years now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward - under oath - and prove anything in a court of law,\" Kemp shared on X, the social media site previously known as Twitter. \"Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible, and fair and will continue to be as long as I am governor.\"\n\nWith regard to the next election, in which Trump is again a candidate, Kemp said: \"The future of our country is at stake in 2024 and that must be our focus.\"\n\nTrump has frequently attacked Kemp for his many refutations of fraud, and even backed a Republican primary challenger to the governor in 2022. Kemp easily won reelection .\n\n− David Jackson\n\nBrad Raffensperger: The famous election official at the center of the indictment\n\nRemember Brad Raffensperger? The Georgia Secretary of State first made headlines for refusing to \"find\" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in 2020.\n\nIn a recorded phone call that lasted over an hour, Trump pressured the Peach State's top election official to reverse election results, telling Raffensperger, \"there’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.\"\n\nRaffensperger's job is an elected position voters tend to pay little mind. But secretaries of state rose to prominence in the wake of the 2020 election, Raffensperger among the most famous. He has continued to deny claims of voter fraud, including before the House subcommittee on the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“The most basic principles of a strong democracy are accountability and respect for the Constitution and rule of law. You either have it, or you don’t,\" he said in a statement following Trump's indictment.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat does RICO mean? What does racketeering mean?\n\nThe most notable charge against Trump is racketeering. Georgia prosecutors alleged Trump orchestrated a series of crimes with a common objective in mind – remaining in power despite his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nThe Georgia case is centered on the state’s RICO statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The law was originally intended to combat organized crime, specifically aimed at prosecuting mafia bosses. Though the mafia is largely non-existent today, RICO laws are still used to battle other forms of criminal enterprise.\n\nRICO laws allow prosecutors to connect multiple crimes among multiple defendants for them to tell a clear story. The charges in Georgia detail what prosecutors allege is a clear conspiracy to overturn Trump’s loss in the state, with the former president as the mastermind behind the crime.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat's happens after an indictment? Fani Willis and Donald Trump plan next steps\n\nThe parties involved in the latest indictment of Donald Trump spent Tuesday plotting their next moves.\n\nFor one thing, they have to work out schedules for arraignments of Trump and his 18 co-defendants, who will presumably plead not guilty to the charges.\n\nAt her late night news conference, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said the indicted individuals have until Friday, Aug, 25, to surrender or face arrest warrants. Fulton County officials said Trump would be treated like any other defendant, and that includes fingerprints and a mug shot.\n\nThere's also the distinct possibility that the arraignment will be televised.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump said he will hold a news conference on Monday to discuss the charges against him.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nCan Brian Kemp pardon Donald Trump?\n\nIf Trump is convicted and sentenced to prison in Georgia, he won't be able to rely on Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for an automatic pardon.\n\nInstead, under the Georgia state constitution, the pardon power resides with a state board of pardons and paroles, although its members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. Even so: The rules call for pardon candidates to have completed their sentences, have no pending charges, and wait five years.\n\nIn light of these challenges, some Republican legislators in Georgia have called for changing the law to grant Kemp the authority to pardon Trump.\n\nIn a statement, Kemp's office confirmed that \"the Georgia Constitution does not give the governor pardon power. It is vested in the board of pardons and paroles.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWillis wants a Trump trial date 'within six months'\n\nWillis told reporters she would like a trial date for the Trump case \"within the next six months,\" emphasizing RICO defendants get prison – not probation.\n\n\"It is not a probated sentence,\" she said during a brief news conference in which she outlined the charges in the indictment.\n\nThe Atlanta DA also said she would like to try all 19 defendants together.\n\nThe indictment outlines a \"criminal conspiracy\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election, she said. But Willis added that the defendants are innocent until proven guilty.\n\n− USA TODAY Staff\n\nThe Georgia indictment list: Donald Trump's 18 co-defendants\n\nAides, attorneys, and campaign officials: these are the kinds of people who were indicted along with Trump in the Georgia election case.\n\nThe list:\n\nRudy Giuliani , a Trump lawyer - and former New York City mayor - who was actively involved in the Georgia election protest;\n\n, a Trump lawyer - and former New York City mayor - who was actively involved in the Georgia election protest; Mark Meadows , former White House chief of staff who helped organize many of the protests in Georgia and elsewhere;\n\n, former White House chief of staff who helped organize many of the protests in Georgia and elsewhere; John Eastman , a lawyer who developed legal theories on how Trump could spike some of Biden's electoral votes;\n\n, a lawyer who developed legal theories on how Trump could spike some of Biden's electoral votes; Kenneth Chesebro , an active pro-Trump lawyer;\n\n, an active pro-Trump lawyer; Jeffrey Clark , a top Justice Department official;\n\n, a top Justice Department official; Jenna Ellis , a Trump campaign lawyer;\n\n, a Trump campaign lawyer; Robert Cheeley, a lawyer who promoted evidence-free claims of fraud;\n\na lawyer who promoted evidence-free claims of fraud; Mike Roman , a Trump campaign official;\n\n, a Trump campaign official; David Shafer, Georgia Republican Party chairman and one of the so-called \"fake electors;\"\n\nGeorgia Republican Party chairman and one of the so-called \"fake electors;\" Shawn Still , another fake Trump elector;\n\n, another fake Trump elector; Stephen Lee , a pastor involved in alleged intimidation of election workers;\n\n, a pastor involved in alleged intimidation of election workers; Harrison Floyd , leader of Black Voices for Trump;\n\n, leader of Black Voices for Trump; Trevian Kutti, a publicist involved in alleged intimidation of election workers;\n\na publicist involved in alleged intimidation of election workers; Sidney Powell, a Trump campaign lawyer who pushed conspiracy theories about the balloting;\n\na Trump campaign lawyer who pushed conspiracy theories about the balloting; Cathy Latham , a fake Trump elector tied to attempts to breach voting systems in Coffee County;\n\n, a fake Trump elector tied to attempts to breach voting systems in Coffee County; Scott Hall, accused of involvement in Coffee County election system breach;\n\naccused of involvement in Coffee County election system breach; Misty Hampton , Coffee County elections supervisor;\n\n, Coffee County elections supervisor; Ray Smith, a Trump campaign attorney.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHillary Clinton: 'I don't feel any satisfaction' after Trump indictment\n\nAs the political world waited Monday night for Georgia officials to unseal the Trump indictments, MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" featured a most intriguing guest: Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee who lost the 2016 election to Trump said she took no joy in her rival's legal troubles.\n\n“I don't feel any satisfaction,\" Clinton said. \"I feel great, profound sadness that we have a former president who has been indicted for so many charges that went right to the heart of whether or not our democracy would survive.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is a terrible moment for our country to have a former president accused of these terribly important crimes.”\n\n− David Jackson\n\nRudy Giuliani, who pioneered the use of RICO, indicted on RICO charges\n\nPresident Richard Nixon signed the federal RICO provisions into law in 1970, part of an effort to give authorities the power to go after the heads of Mafia families who managed to insulate themselves from prosecution.\n\nBefore he became a personal attorney to Trump and was caught up in the investigations swirling around the former president, it was Giuliani who put a national spotlight on RICO statutes. The former U.S. attorney wielded that law to prosecute the leaders of several mob families in New York in the late 1980s.\n\nLast year, Giuliani's attorneys acknowledged that he was a target of the Georgia probe. According to the indictment, Giuliani repeatedly made false statements about the outcome of the election as he attempted to convince state lawmakers in several states to appoint electors who would support Trump.\n\nGiuliani condemned the charges this week as “an affront” to democracy that harms the justice system.\n\nA former federal prosecutor as well as mayor New York City, Giuliani said: “it’s just the next chapter in a book of lies with the purpose of framing President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime.”\n\n− John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nTrump reaction to Georgia indictment\n\nIn a statement, Trump's legal team denounced the \"shocking and absurd\" events, including an accelerated timeline for witness testimony and the accidental release of a \"presumed and premature indictment before the witnesses had testified or the grand jurors had deliberated.\"\n\nThe legal team − attorneys Drew Findling, Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg − also said the \"one-sided grand jury presentation relied on witnesses who harbor their own personal and political interests\" against Trump.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTrump was indicted, not convicted: What's the difference?\n\nThe indictment against Trump kicked off another criminal legal process for the former president, where at the end of it, he could be convicted.\n\nAn indictment is merely a formal document that alleges a person committed a crime. Trump is granted the presumption of innocence as the legal process moves forward.\n\nA conviction is when a jury finds the defendant guilty. In Trump’s case, if there is a trial in the Georgia case, then a jury would vote at its conclusion on whether Trump is guilty of the crimes the indictment accuses him of.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat are Trump's other cases?\n\nTrump faces several civil and criminal cases as he campaigns for president in 2024:\n\nTrump was accused of trying to steal the 2020 presidential election by federal officials earlier this month.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James has a $250 million civil trial scheduled to start Oct. 2 against Trump’s namesake company on allegations of fraud for lying for a decade about the value of properties.\n\nE. Jean Carroll won a $5 million defamation case against Trump, which he is appealing. She has another trial scheduled to begin in New York on Jan. 15 – the day of Iowa Republican presidential caucuses.\n\nNew York District Attorney Alvin Bragg has a criminal trial scheduled to start March 25 on 34 charges of falsifying business records to pay hush money before the 2016 election to a woman who claimed to have had sex with him.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has a federal trial tentatively scheduled to start May 20 in Florida on charges related to classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago estate a year and a half after leaving the White House. Trump faces 40 charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice, retaining national defense records and concealing the records from authorities.\n\n− David Jackson and Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is an indictment?\n\nAn indictment is a formal document that contains allegations that someone committed a crime. It includes the charges laid out against a person and is filed before a case can move forward in court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWeinstein said that an indictment means a grand jury decided that there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person. At least twelve jurors must be in agreement that a defendant allegedly committed a crime to issue an indictment.\n\nAfter a person is indicted, they must go to trial where a jury will reach an unanimous decision on whether to pursue conviction.\n\nCan Trump still run for president if he’s indicted?\n\nYes, Trump can continue his 2024 presidential campaign, even after being indicted again.\n\n\"Legally speaking, there is nothing to bar a former president from being indicted for a state crime, running for office – even convicted,\" said Jessica Levinson, founding director of Loyola Law School's Public Service Institute, previously told USA TODAY. \"It really just becomes an issue of, practically, how could you run the country behind bars, if ever came to something like that?\"\n\nThe Constitution only lays out three requirements to serve as president.

Voting machines altering ballots. Thousands of felons, underage voters and even dead people casting ballots like a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThese were among the false and baseless allegations Donald Trump and his allies spread about the 2020 election. The Justice Department and Georgia state investigators found no evidence of widespread fraud. Former Attorney General Bill Barr called the allegations “complete nonsense.”\n\nOn Monday they became evidence of a broad criminal conspiracy allegedly led by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis cobbled together an indictment detailing 161 separate acts sprawled across a half-dozen states and Washington, D.C., that she says fueled a criminal enterprise.\n\nThe narrative tracks closely with the revelations from the House special committee that investigated the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, and riveting testimony during 2022 hearings. But rather than ending in a thick report, the criminal allegations threaten prison time.\n\nHere is a sample of what some of the most prominent defendants other than Trump are accused of doing in Georgia:\n\nMark Meadows\n\nMark Meadows, Trump’s final White House chief of staff, worked on claims of fake ballots being cast in Georgia, met with state election officials as they oversaw the vote count and coordinated efforts to overturn the results, according to the House investigation.\n\nThe indictment focuses on several steps Meadows took, beginning with Meadows and Trump asking political aide John McEntee sometime during December 2020 to prepare a memo outlining the strategy for Vice President Mike Pence, in his role as Senate president, to reject electoral votes from certain states during the congressional count on Jan. 6, 2021, and returning them to state legislatures. Pence refused to participate.\n\nMeadows visited the Cobb County Civic Center in Georgia on Dec. 22, 2020, seeking to observe the audit of ballot signatures being performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Secretary of State’s office. Local officials prevented him from viewing the audit, which was not open to the public.\n\nThe next day, Meadows arranged for Trump to call Frances Watson, chief investigator for the Georgia secretary of state. Trump falsely stated he won the state “by hundreds of thousands of votes,” according to the indictment. Trump told Watson that “when the right answer comes out you’ll be praised,” according to the indictment.\n\nMeadows sent Watson a text on Dec. 27 asking if there was “a way to speed up Fulton county signature verification” if the Trump campaign provided financial assistance.\n\nMeadows participated in Trump's call on Jan. 2, 2021, to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to “find” the votes he needed to win the state. By that point, Trump had tried to call him 18 times and Raffensperger had avoided taking the calls, according to the House investigation.\n\n“I just want to find 11,780 votes,” Trump said during the call. “Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already.”\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said again Tuesday that the election wasn’t stolen.\n\n“For nearly three years now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward – under oath – and prove anything in a court of law,” Kemp said on the social media platform X. “Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible, and fair and will continue to be as long as I am governor.”\n\nBesides the racketeering count charged against all defendants, Meadows was charged with soliciting Raffensperger to violate his oath of office.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nRudy Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers who claimed familiarity with voter fraud from his experience running for mayor in New York and as a former U.S. attorney, advocated claims of voter fraud that were debunked by state and federal officials.\n\nThe indictment cites Giuliani, along with Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, for falsely claiming election fraud in Georgia and other states during a news conference Nov. 19, 2020, at the Republican National Committee headquarters.\n\nGiuliani made the claims in a series of December 2020 meetings with Georgia lawmakers, according to the indictment:\n\nOn Dec. 3, in a meeting with members of a state Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Giuliani falsely claimed that 96,600 mail-in ballots were incorrectly counted and that voting machines in Michigan recorded 6,000 votes for President Joe Biden that were supposed to go to Trump.\n\nOn Dec. 10, in a meeting with members of the state House Governmental Affairs Committee, Giuliani’s statements alleged that election workers at State Farm Arena stole votes in plain sight, that 12,000 to 24,000 ballots were illegally counted and that election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss were “passing around USB ports as if they’re vials of heroin or cocaine.\" Freeman and Moss testified at a U.S. House hearing that they were passing ginger mints.\n\nOn Dec. 30, in a meeting with members of a Judiciary subcommittee, Giuliani’s statements included 2,560 felons voting illegally and 10,315 dead people voting.\n\nThe indictment said Giuliani called Georgia’s legislative leaders – Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller and House Speaker David Ralston – in December urging a special legislative session.\n\nBesides the racketeering count, Giuliani was charged with three counts of soliciting lawmakers to violate their oath of office, three counts of making false statements and six conspiracy counts dealing with forgery and false statements for the recruitment of fake electors.\n\nGiuliani said Tuesday on his podcast that he was indicted for being a lawyer and that a \"two-tiered system of justice is no justice at all.\"\n\nJohn Eastman\n\nJohn Eastman, another Trump lawyer, helped develop the legal strategy for Pence to reject electors from key states so legislatures could name alternate electors who favored Trump.\n\nEastman acknowledged the Supreme Court would likely rule unanimously against the strategy, according to Pence counsel Greg Jacob. U.S. District Judge David Carter ruled in a civil case that Trump and Eastman “more likely than not” acted unlawfully in the scheme the judge described as “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nThe indictment focused on several steps Eastman took to advocate for the strategy. For example, he participated in Giuliani's meeting with Georgia lawmakers Dec. 3, 2020.\n\nEastman sent an email on Dec. 6, 2020, to co-conspirator lawyer Robert Cheeley and state Sen. Brandon Beach stating Trump electors needed to meet Dec. 14, sign six sets of certificates and mail them to the Senate president.\n\nEastman sent an email Dec. 7 to Giuliani with a memo from another lawyer, Kenneth Chesebro, about “the real deadline for settling a state’s electoral votes.” Eastman sent an email Dec. 23 to Chesebro discussing fake electors. “The fact that we have multiple slates of electors demonstrates the uncertainty of either,” Eastman wrote. “That should be enough.”\n\nEastman and Trump allegedly filed false documents Dec. 31, 2020, by filing a lawsuit in federal court with “materially false statements” about Georgia voters, according to the indictment. The claims included “as many as 10,315 or more” dead people, “as many as 2,506 felons with an uncompleted sentence,” “at least 66,247 underage” people, “at least 2,423 individuals” not listed as being registered to vote and “at least 1,043 individuals” listing a post office box as their address, according to the indictment.\n\nWhat happened Jan. 6?: A breakdown of the 187 minutes Trump was out of view on Jan. 6 as aides urged him to act\n\nEarlier on the same day, Eastman sent an email to Trump campaign lawyers “admitting his knowledge that at least some of the allegations in the verified complaint were not accurate,” the indictment said.\n\nEastman met on Jan. 5, 2021, with Jacob and Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, to ask Pence to reject slates of presidential electors from Georgia and other states the next day when Congress counted the votes.\n\nEastman appeared at Trump’s rally near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, and made false statements about the election, according to the indictment. Eastman sent Jacob an email that day urging Pence to adjourn the vote for 10 days to allow legislatures to investigate potential voting fraud, the indictment said.\n\nBesides the racketeering count, Eastman was charged with soliciting state lawmakers to violate their oath of office, filing false documents for the lawsuit and six conspiracy counts dealing with the recruitment of fake electors.\n\nEastman has refused to answer questions from the U.S. House investigative panel or the Georgia grand jury, based on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nKenneth Chesebro\n\nKenneth Chesebro, another lawyer working with Trump’s campaign, wrote a series of memos explaining how Trump electors in Georgia and other states could meet and cast votes for Trump despite his losses in those states. But he acknowledged the strategy was “somewhat dicey” in Georgia because of state requirements.\n\nThe strategy divided Trump campaign lawyers. Justin Clark, Trump’s deputy campaign manager and senior counsel, told the House investigation he had “real problems with the process” and “got into a little bit of a back and forth” with Chesebro.\n\nAs with Eastman, the indictment detailed steps Chesebro took to advocate for the strategy.\n\nChesebro sent an email on Dec. 10 to David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party and one of the fake electors, saying the Trump campaign asked him to “help coordinate” logistics of electors voting. Chesebro sent Shafer an email that day with attached documents for casting electoral votes.\n\nChesebro sent Giuliani an email on Dec. 13 outlining strategies for disrupting and delaying the Jan. 6, 2021, session of Congress to count electoral votes. Chesebro said the strategies were “preferable to allowing the Electoral Count Act to operate by its own terms.”\n\nChesebro sent an email Dec. 13 to Mike Roman, a Trump campaign aide, with attached documents for Trump electors to use in Georgia and other states. Chesebro sent an email Dec. 13 to Roman saying Giuliani “wants to keep this quiet until after all the voting is done,” according to the indictment.\n\nBesides the racketeering count, Chesebro was charged with six conspiracy counts dealing with forgery and false documents for the fake electors.\n\nChesebro also declined to answer House questions based on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nJeffrey Clark\n\nJeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general for environmental issues at the Justice Department, was charged for drafting a letter with false statements about Georgia’s election for the attorney general. Trump briefly considered naming Clark attorney general but didn’t act after top department and White House lawyers threatened to resign.\n\nEric Herschmann, a former White House lawyer, told House investigators he was incredulous when he heard Clark’s strategy, calling it “asinine.”\n\nClark drafted the letter on Dec. 28, 2020, for Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to sign and send to Kemp and legislative leaders. The letter falsely said the department “identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia,” according to the indictment.\n\nClark discussed the election during a 63-minute call Jan. 2, 2021, with Scott Hall, a Georgia bail bondsman who was also indicted. The same day, Clark asked Rosen and Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue to sign and send the letter, which they refused.\n\nBesides the racketeering count, Clark with charged with attempting to commit false statements.\n\nClark, too, declined to answer House questions under his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nSidney Powell\n\nSidney Powell, another Trump lawyer, became the public face of Trump’s legal challenges to the 2020 election, but law enforcement authorities found no justification for her claims of election fraud.\n\nThe indictment focuses in Georgia on her alleged tampering with voting equipment in Coffee County. She entered a written agreement Dec. 6, 2020, with SullivanStrickler LLC, a forensic data firm in Fulton County, to analyze voting equipment. An unlawful breach of equipment in Coffee County, Georgia, occurred under the agreement, according to the indictment.\n\nPowell, Cathleen Latham, Scott Hall and Misty Hampton were charged with election interference for allegedly unlawfully tampering with electronic ballot markers and tabulating machines in Coffee County on Jan. 7, 2021. They were also charged with unlawful possession of ballots, computer theft, computer trespass and computer invasion of privacy. And they were charged with conspiracy to defraud the state by stealing voter data.\n\nPowell met at the White House on Dec. 18, 2020, with Trump and Giuliani to discuss strategies for altering the outcome of the election, including seizing voting equipment, according to the indictment. Powell was named a special counsel with broad authority to investigate voter fraud allegations, the indictment said.\n\nIn a sworn deposition May 7, 2022, with the House investigative committee, Powell made false statements including that she “didn’t have any role in really setting up” attempts to access voting machines in Georgia or Michigan and that she didn’t “know what happened with that” or “remember whether that was Rudy or other folks.”\n\nJenna Ellis\n\nJenna Ellis, another Trump lawyer, joined Giuliani at many of his appearances making claims of election fraud.

Biden said Trump and his supporters \"held a dagger at the throat of America.\"\n\n\"You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said. “You can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient. You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.\"\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, pushing through police barricades and smashing windows in an attempt to disrupt Congress' certification of the presidential election results. The events of that day led to five deaths, hundreds of arrests and Trump's second impeachment, as well as the creation of a bipartisan House select committee to investigate the attack. That committee's work is ongoing.\n\nThe violent insurrection was predicated on the misguided belief that widespread voter fraud swayed the election in Biden's favor. This was a baseless claim when Trump first made it in late 2020, and the year that passed since has only added to the evidence of the election's legitimacy.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Harrington for comment.\n\nAmple evidence fraud did not affect election outcome\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Biden's win, election officials insisted the results were legitimate.\n\n\"The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,\" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its partners said in a November 2020 statement. \"There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.\"\n\nTrump's own attorney general, William Barr, said in early December 2020 that the Justice Department had \"not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.\" Biden won the presidency with 306 electoral votes, which Congress certified in January 2021 after the Capitol riot.\n\nFact check roundup: Debunking false narratives about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot\n\nAt the time, some Republican lawmakers also pushed back on claims of widespread fraud.\n\n\"Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election – nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence,\" Sen.

The Supreme Court refused to take up several cases challenging results in battleground states that played a key role in the outcome of the election.\n\nIn those battleground states, numerous audits and recounts have affirmed Biden's win:\n\nMany claims of fraud stemmed from a misunderstanding of how vote counting and reporting processes work in different states.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for example, some claimed late-night vote dumps for Biden were proof of fraud. That's wrong – the state can't count absentee ballots until Election Day, so tallies for the largest counties can take all day to complete, or even into the night. On election night, that resulted in a late addition of absentee votes, which trended heavily Democratic in 2020.\n\nSimilar narratives targeted other contested states.\n\nIn Michigan, an election-night typo resulted in the addition of more than 100,000 votes to Biden's tally. Although the clerical error was quickly corrected, some falsely claimed it was evidence of voter fraud. In Georgia, footage of poll workers placing ballots in their proper storage containers was also misconstrued as evidence of fraud.\n\nSpecial access for subscribers!

Since then a majority of my ancestors and family have been Republicans. My grandmother was a Republican committee woman who worked the polls at the Belle Valley Fire Hall on Election Day. With the exceptions of Nixon's second term and 2020, I had been a Republican for 54 years. I am now a Democrat.\n\nI do not know what you might call the amalgam of MAGA, Tea Party and Dixie-Publicans now running for office, but they are not the Grand Old Party. They are an insult to the legacies of my heroes: Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Eisenhower. I will not vote for a candidate who has been convicted of felonies, has committed adultery with a porn star, or who organized and incited a coup against Congress and the Constitution on January 6th.\n\nAmericans do not bow to tyrants or would-be dictators. Christians do not preach revenge and retribution. Choose this November which way you will vote, but as for me and my house, we will follow the way of democracy.\n\nKarl E. Ebert, Cranesville\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThis election is about character, not party loyalty\n\nAfter 31 years in the Navy, most of it on submarines, I know what real leadership looks like. As a Republican, I've always believed in personal responsibility, strong national defense, and limited government. I voted for Donald Trump in 2020, hoping he would uphold those values. I was wrong.\n\nTrump's actions are impulsive, self-centered, reckless — and they're dangerous. He's simply unfit for public office. He doesn't represent the values that make America the land of the free and home of the brave. That's why I'm endorsing Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThis election isn't about party loyalty — it's about character and leadership. While Trump and his supporters have taken over the Republican Party I once supported, his lack of character has had more serious consequences. He's alienated our allies, weakened NATO, and cozied up to dictators while defaming the people who fought to protect this country. He has weakened our national security and damaged America's global reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, Vice President Harris has earned global respect by working closely with our allies. She understands that America’s strength lies in alliances and diplomacy, not isolation. Trump's reckless approach to foreign policy made us less secure while Vice President Harris has fostered unity and cooperation making us more secure.\n\nMore importantly, Trump's bad character is destroying our ability to govern ourselves with the trust, facts, and unity of purpose we need. It is destroying our ability to trust others. His personal corruption risks corrupting our government and our culture. His bad character drives us apart and demands we choose him over lifetime friends.\n\nAs a military veteran, I trust Vice President Harris' integrity and commitment to America's security. I trust her character. She has vowed to keep America's fighting force the strongest in the world while ensuring veterans and their families receive the care they've earned. She has the good character we need to trust each other, to trust the facts, and to regain our unity of purpose.\n\nMeasuring character is not a policy decision. It is a \"yes-no\" qualification that the voters get to enforce. On Nov. 5th, I urge you to vote for Kamala Harris and say \"no\" to Donald Trump.\n\nFred Byus, U.S. Navy Retired Rear Admiral\n\nDemocrats support Ukraine in war against Russia, vote them out\n\nI believe the Democratic Party are now warmongers. On Sept. 23 Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro posted a video of himself on social media writing his signature on bombs heading to the war in Ukraine. U.S. Senator Bob Casey Jr. and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is defending his nation from a Russian invasion, were in the background.\n\nThis should shock you to the core. Please, have a discussion with your friends and family. If you are still on the fence or undecided, please do not support the Democrats. I'm done talking and reasoning with Kamala Harris supporters.\n\nMyself, I'm going full red this year.\n\nDaniel Hotchkiss, Erie\n\nQuestions to ask this election\n\nI was born and raised in Warren County enjoying time in Erie County with family and attending Penn State Behrend.\n\nHere some thoughts on the election:\n\nOn the economy, no switch is flipped when a new president is elected. The new president simply inherits the past president's economy. The Trump administration inherited a decent economy, but failed to maintain it due to lack of leadership in the early stages of COVID combined with global inflation caused by supply chain issues. The Biden Administration worked to clean up the mess to contain inflation at lower levels than most other countries.\n\nImmigration is very complicated. We are a country of immigrants. Immigrants are a necessary part of our economy. Immigrants fill jobs not wanted by other Americans, like picking our crops. Shutting a border will not stop people from wanting to live in our great country. It will cause a huge tax burden to maintain a physical border and detainment centers forever.\n\nQuestions to ask:\n\nIs it right someone making $40,000 a year should pay a larger percentage of salary to taxes than someone making $4 million a year?\n\nIs it right women should be afraid to make their own health decisions?\n\nIs it right greed is allowed to run rampant causing price gouging, causing people harm to their health or preventing Americans from affording a home?\n\nIf you are not 100% sure who to vote for, please vote for Kamala Harris. She is a decent human being, who will fight for every American's opportunity to thrive.\n\nLinda Mazzu, Russell\n\nRepublican voter fears dictatorship if strong man wins\n\nAs a longtime Republican voter, my vote in this year's election will be guided by the following:\n\nMy family has been in America for over 200 years, and I have voted in Pennsylvania elections for 50 years. With redistricting, Glenn Thompson and Mike Kelly have served as my congressmen. Even if we occasionally disagreed on a particular policy, I always trusted my congressmen to respect my and other citizens' right to determine which politicians would represent us. That trust ended when Congressmen Thompson and Kelly followed Donald Trump's directions and tried to take away many of our Pennsylvania votes through the Texas lawsuit — just so Trump could win one election.\n\nThroughout history, both left-wing dictatorships like Communist China and right-wing dictatorships like Russia and Nazi Germany have both used the same tactic to take over democracies. A strong man instills fear and convinces well-meaning citizens that individual citizen votes do not matter so long as the strong man is elected. Then, once power is gained, it is not peaceably returned at the end of the strong man's term, and free elections vanish.\n\nI do not agree with some of Kamala Harris' policies, but if I make a mistake by voting for her, our democracy will give me the opportunity to correct my mistake in future elections. If instead I make a mistake by voting for Trump and congressmen like Thompson and Kelly, I may no longer have that chance to correct.\n\nDonald Mong, Franklin\n\nThis election, heed our generals\n\n\"The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.\" These are the words of George Washington, our nation's first president.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to our 45th president, who mocked a cancer-stricken POW who spent 5 1/2 years in captivity. He humiliated the Gold Star parents, mourning the loss of their son who was killed in combat, and then referred to those who died in the service and the uniform of their nation as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\nJohn Kelly, a four-star Marine Corps general, who lost a son in combat, said, \"Trump is incapable of understanding honor, duty and sacrifice. He is a person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.\"\n\nFour-star Admiral William McRaven, one of the most famous Navy Seals in American history, directed these words to Trump: \"Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage, and worst of all, divided us as a nation.\"\n\nRetired four-star Army General Barry McCaffrey has been a fierce critic of Trump. In August he stated on X, \"America is facing an existential crisis for our democracy. Trump is a threat to the rule of law. He is publicly saying he will upend our freedom…our fundamental safeguards. His basic persona is to create authoritarian rule.\"\n\nI believe the consensus of most admirals and generals who served under Trump is that the disdain Trump has shown toward veterans is because their service shames him and forces him to face his own obvious cowardice.\n\nRecently, a bipartisan group of 741 national security advisors, including 230 generals and flag officers, have endorsed Vice President Harris, stating, \"This election is a choice between serious leadership and vengeful impulsiveness. A choice between democracy and authoritarianism. Harris defines America's democratic ideals while Trump endangers them.\"\n\nPrior to Trump, we were a nation where the most sacred recognition in the secular world was that of valor in war.\n\nAmerica, where did you go?\n\nT.J. Heenan, U.S. Air Force veteran, Tidioute\n\nVote with God on Nov. 5\n\nMatthew 25:32 reads: \"and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.\"\n\nBiblically speaking, this year's general election at every level (federal, state, and even local), has a distinct difference in the candidates and their policies. This year's election, by far, is making it very easy for the shepherd (God) to separate the sheep from the goats.\n\nFor yourself, your family, and your nation, please choose wisely.\n\nCharles Adamczyk, Erie\n\nRepublican urges GOP to 'dump Trump,' take party back\n\nMy wife and I were recently in Washington, D.C., with friends to experience the museums and memorials. This wasn't our first trip to D.C., but it was the first time I had been to the FDR (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) Memorial which is sandwiched in between the Korean and Vietnam war memorials. In this time of uncertainty, it was good to see what some of our great leaders had to say about government, freedom and democracy. I was struck by one of FDR's quotes regarding government:\n\n\"They who seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all human beings by a handful of individual rulers, call this a new order. It is not new and it is not order.\"\n\nI believe he was talking about fascism, but he could have been talking about the current state of the Republican Party. I have been a Republican for most of my life and it is unrecognizable at present. The take-no-prisoners attitude, the lying, the bullying and racism are not what this country is about. There is only one way to take back the Republican Party and that is to dump Trump. I urge my fellow Republicans to do what they know in their hearts is the right thing and vote for the Democrat. They at least are for democracy.\n\nJon Welsh, Fairview\n\nSetting the record straight on Harris\n\nContrary to Donald Trump's claims, Kamala Harris unequivocally said during their debate: \"I made that very clear in 2020. I will not ban fracking.\" As vice president, Harris voted to increase leases for fracking as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nUnlike Donald Trump, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz believe in tough, smart solutions to secure the border, keep communities safe, and reform our broken immigration system.\n\nAs Attorney General of California, Vice President Harris went after international drug gangs, human traffickers and cartels that smuggled guns, drugs, and human beings across the U.S.-Mexico border. As vice president, she supported the bipartisan border security bill, the strongest reform in decades. The legislation would have deployed more detection technology to intercept fentanyl and other drugs and added 1,500 border security agents to protect our border. That's why the Border Patrol union endorsed it.\n\nAfter Donald Trump killed the border deal for his political gain, Vice President Harris and President Biden took administrative action on their own. As a result, border crossings are at the lowest level in four years; their administration is seizing record amounts of fentanyl, and has secured funding for the most significant increase in border agents in 10 years.\n\nAs president, Kamala Harris will bring back the bipartisan border security bill and sign it into law. At the same time, she knows that our immigration system is broken and needs comprehensive reform that includes strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.\n\nSam R. Talarico, chair, Erie County Democratic Party\n\nConstitution not the only consideration this election\n\nOn a CNN program, former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and Vice President Kamala Harris were claiming that the if Republicans win the election, they will destroy the Constitution.\n\nI think the people who are want to abolish the Electoral College, seek statehood for the District of Columbia, and pack the Supreme Court are the people who will completely change our government as we know it today.\n\nA national debt of $35 trillion is not being debated and history has shown that this type of debt is destructive.\n\nKeith Farnham, Fairview\n\nVote 'no' on Millcreek study and defend democracy\n\nI am writing to express my concern for the future of Millcreek Township. There is a group of people who are attempting to change the form of government in Millcreek. I believe the reason they want to change the form of government is because they do not agree with the supervisors' decision to purchase the properties on West Eighth Street. But rather than challenging the decision in an election, as we do in a democracy, this group has decided they want to change the entire structure of Millcreek government, costing the taxpayers more than necessary.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the purchases on West Eighth Street, this is not the way our country was set up to disagree with a decision an elected official makes. In a democracy, if you don't like decisions being made, then you have the opportunity to vote people out. You don't upend the entire government.\n\nIt is for this reason that I urge every Millcreek resident to vote \"no\" to the government study question on the ballot. A \"no\" vote is a vote to protect democracy.\n\nClaudia DiNardo, Millcreek\n\nHow much more will Americans tolerate?\n\nAre we really OK with Trump's stated desire to use the military against American citizens? People he deems to be \"the radical left\"? People like Congressman Adam Schiff? He's promised \"mass deportations\" of people who are in the country illegally and legally, \"liberating the country,\" he stated. He's also claimed that the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, are not here legally, which is false and caused death and bomb threats, and risked the general safety of the citizens of Springfield. His lies about FEMA have caused confusion, unnecessary suffering and threats. How un-American is that? Are we really OK with this?\n\nHow can you let one man and his sycophants destroy the societal norms we have been privileged to enjoy?\n\nAn unprecedented number of national security experts are warning us about this man and yet, some of you only believe him. Does this type of propaganda sound familiar? If it does, are we really OK with this?\n\nWhen I think of the possibility of Donald Trump winning back all the powers of being president, I'm filled with dread. If you're not, then you must ask yourself, why is it you put all of your belief, all of your faith in one man? Do you not see what history has shown us with this blind faith? Do you not see where we could be headed? If you refuse to believe what you hear and see for yourselves, and go along because you also have strong feelings about people who do not look like you or think you lived \"better\" even though thousands (400,000) of Americans died on his watch (pandemic), please consider this…he would be ineligible to get a job in the medical field, the financial industry, or even security because at the end of the day, he is after all, a felon.\n\nAre we really OK with that?\n\nEllie Burrell, Erie\n\nWhat Trump's lies could cost us\n\n\"A lie told often enough becomes [perceived as] the truth.\" It is a quote variously attributed to Bolshevik leader Vladimir I. Lenin and Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda. Donald Trump has learned this lesson well, whether or not he is aware of the origins of this practice. Let me give a small sample of Trump's lies that all too many Americans have come to accept.\n\nFor four years the main focus of Trump's lying has been what has come to be known as the Big Lie: that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. This claim has been exhaustively investigated and the result has always been that there is no serious evidence to support it. Fox News settled a major defamation suit for its own role in spreading the Big Lie, paying Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million for accusing it of major vote fraud in the election. I believe the Trump campaign is already preparing to spread a new Big Lie should he lose the upcoming election.\n\nBut Trump has also spread other major lies, especially in connection with crime and immigration. He tells us that violent crime is rising and \"out of control,\" especially in big cities; but FBI and other government data indicate that such crime has declined significantly since he left office. (Trump disputes the data but offers no evidence for doing so.)\n\nRelatedly Trump tells us that undocumented immigrants have created a crime wave, but studies indicate that they don't raise crime rates and may even have lower crime rates. There is also no basis for his claims that most or many migrants used to reside in insane asylums, that they are destabilizing Social Security (which they pay into but do not receive), and that Haitian immigrants in Ohio have been eating people's pets. The latter claim has been debunked by Republican government officials in that state, but Trump refuses to retract it.\n\nTrump insists that Kamala Harris would raise taxes on ordinary Americans. But her economic plan emphasizes lowering taxes for middle class and working class Americans, while raising them for the wealthy (who received most of the benefits of Trump's huge 2017 tax cut). That plan, by the way, also includes increasing the minimum wage, which is still a miserly $7.25 an hour — a raise that Trump refuses to support.\n\nFinally, Trump spreads lies about Harris' mental capacities, going so far as to call her mentally disabled, while his own show increasingly clear signs of decline, in my opinion.\n\nDonald Trump's lies about election fraud, crime, and immigration are especially dangerous, for they risk destabilizing our precious democracy. May American voters not allow themselves to be duped by his demogogic lying.\n\nS.J. Sullivan, Erie\n\nErie, you are the heart of America's future\n\nOver the years, traveling from Cleveland, Ohio, to sell medical equipment to hospitals and nursing homes across Western Pennsylvania, I have had the privilege of getting to know the people of Erie. The friendships I formed along the way, whether bonding over football stories about the Browns, Steelers, and Bills or discussing local politics, taught me that Erie is home to some of the nicest, hardest-working, and most caring people in the country.\n\nNow, Erie finds itself in a crucial position. The next President of the United States could be determined by how this community votes. Erie is in the national spotlight, and its decision will have lasting consequences across the country.\n\nKamala Harris embodies the values that Erie holds dear. She has consistently honored our military, championing veterans' healthcare and ensuring that those who serve our country are respected. Additionally, her plan focuses on housing and small business development — issues that are vital for Erie's growth and prosperity. Harris has long been a supporter of labor unions, recognizing their role in advocating for workers' rights and fair wages. By investing in affordable housing and supporting local entrepreneurs, she aims to uplift communities like Erie, helping families thrive and strengthening the local economy. She has also played a crucial role in helping our country successfully navigate out of the economic disaster left by the pandemic. While we may not be fully back to normal, we are still the leading economy in the world — a testament to effective leadership during challenging times.\n\nIn stark contrast, Donald Trump's values and actions have often undermined the very fabric of community that Erie represents. His rhetoric has sown division rather than unity, as seen when he falsely claimed that immigrants were overrunning Springfield, Ohio, spreading fear instead of facts. Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his repeated lies about election fraud further erode trust in our democracy. Additionally, his administration's policies often favored the wealthy at the expense of working families, as demonstrated by the tax cuts that primarily benefited corporations and the affluent while leaving many struggling to get by. Erie deserves leadership that fosters honesty, inclusivity, and respect for all.\n\nAs the nation and the world watch, the humble, good people of Erie have a profound responsibility. The way they vote in the upcoming election will shape the future of our country. I believe that, with their values of truth, hard work, and love for neighbors, the people of Erie will make the right choice and help lead America forward.\n\nI write with hope for unity in our nation.\n\nSusan Sadid, Cleveland\n\nMigrants, new Americans are vital to our economy\n\nCould the election of Donald Trump cause you to lose your farm or business?\n\nIf you don't believe it, ask Florida farmers. Florida's punishing 2023 anti-immigration law dealt a blow, not just to the workers but to the owners of the farms whose bottom lines were crushed by the loss of labor. The effect of the law was immediate.\n\nThe fact is that without unauthorized immigrants, there are very few farm workers left \"…[B]erries are going to become an item that's going to be a luxury, not something people buy every time they go to the grocery store like they do now,\" Fidel Sanchez, owner of Sanchez Farm in Central Florida says, \"The government doesn't seem to care. Maybe they think the crops are gonna pick themselves.\"\n\nIf Trump wins and starts his crackdown on immigrants, who will harvest your crops? The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that nationwide 40% of farmworkers are unauthorized, and there are even more in Pennsylvania. Will you see your produce rotting on the field? Can you survive the economic blow? Or will you be forced to sell your farm?\n\nNot a farmer? Unfortunately, the shortage of workers is not just impacting agriculture. According to the newamericaneconomy.org, foreign-born workers comprise more than 50% of labor in construction, personal care, housekeeping, hospitality, and textile businesses. Crippling national immigration policies will flatten your bottom line.\n\nThink about it. Think of your future. Protect yourself this election.\n\nMarie Hornbein, retired, Mothersbaugh Farm, Spring Mills\n\nVietnam veterans say voters should put country over party\n\nNellie, my wife, and I are Vietnam veterans. Nellie was an Army nurse, and I am a combat wounded infantry veteran. We served because we felt it was our duty. We write today, again as our duty, to express our grave concerns over the possibility of a second Donald Trump presidency. Of course we resent deeply his disparaging labelling of war veterans and war casualties as \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" but our misgivings run much deeper than his slurs.\n\nWitnessing his erratic and dangerous behavior has led us to our concerns. Most importantly, however, never in our lifetime have more former military leaders, presidential associates, one time allies, and conservative thinking politicians come forward to warn us about the deep inability of Trump to lead this country. Our grave concern is not for us but for our children and grandchildren.\n\nThe criticality of this election rises far beyond differences in policy and party affiliation that could and should be worked out through rational leadership and bipartisanship in the best interest of the country. We believe this election is a choice between democracy and an authoritarianism ruled by lies, fear, and retribution.\n\nThomas Coakley, combat-wounded Vietnam veteran, Nellie Coakley, Army nurse, captain, Vietnam veteran, Canton, N.Y.\n\nThe truth about tariffs\n\nDonald Trump calls himself the \"Tariff Man,\" recently telling business executives at the Economic Club of Chicago that, \"To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff. It's my favorite word.\"\n\nBut let's name tariffs what they really are — sales taxes on imported goods. Trump says that he wants to impose automatic tariffs of 10% to 20% on every country we trade with, 60% on China, and up to 1,000% in some cases.\n\nThe moderator of the Chicago event tried repeatedly to get Trump to understand that ordinary American consumers, not foreign countries, would pay the tariffs in higher prices. Economists estimate that an average American family will pay between $1,700 and $3,900 per year. Trump couldn't be convinced that it mattered.\n\nTrump loves tariffs and he loves giving people nicknames, so let's get his right: \"The Tax Man.\" You will pay the price if he gets elected.\n\nIan MacAlister, Lewisburg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/business/putin-wealth-sanctions-invs", "title": "'There is literally no paper trail': How Russia experts say Putin hides ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe sprawling billion-dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the Black Sea is seen by some Kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s legacy of corruption.\n\nDubbed “Putin’s Palace,” the 190,000 square-foot mega-mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs, whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in Russia’s notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth – with him.\n\nThe property has its own amphitheater, underground hockey rink and private seaport, according to a documentary produced by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s anti-corruption group. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800-square-foot apartment Putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure.\n\nYet, despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat, “I would be very surprised if Putin ever sets foot in there again,” Nate Sibley, an expert on Russian corruption who advises members of Congress, told CNN.\n\nSibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of Putin pursuing, through the wealth of oligarchs, a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary. While Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career, Sibley said, he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views.\n\nThe sprawling palace and property on the coast of the Black Sea are seen in this image from a video by Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. from Alexey Navalny\n\nThat shift, some Russia experts told CNN, may make it more difficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.\n\nPutin has positioned himself, as Sibley put it, “above the fray.”\n\nIt wasn’t always that way. Nearly two decades before Putin drew international ire for his most recent unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin had Russia’s richest man plucked off his private jet and charged him with crimes against the state.\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, an oligarch worth an estimated $15 billion at the time, sat caged in the middle of the courtroom during his highly publicized trial. Khodorkovsky, who had been critical of government corruption under Putin’s leadership, was convicted of tax evasion and fraud, though he argued the charges were politically motivated. Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he has since lived in exile.\n\nPutin’s bold move against the billionaire oil magnate was seen as a message to other oligarchs: You might be next.\n\nThe tactic demanded the unwavering loyalty of the oligarch class.\n\nThe ensuing influx of cash, gifts and goodwill is one explanation for how Putin, who claims a salary of just $140,000 a year, is suspected of being one of the richest people on the planet. He is rumored to own or have access to not only the Black Sea palace, but also a $100 million yacht, according to published reports. CNN was unable to verify Putin’s connection to the palace or yacht. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of Putin’s purported hidden wealth.\n\nThat the properties and other possessions aren’t in his name doesn’t matter, said Tom Burgis, author of a book on international money laundering called “Kleptopia.” Burgis likened Putin to The Godfather and said it’s understood that when he asks an oligarch for something, it’s not really a request.\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, left, and his close associate, Platon Lebedev, seen in a defendant's cage at a courtroom in Moscow on July 12, 2004. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP\n\n“Ultimately they owe everything they have to the boss. And with the click of a finger, as he has shown in the past, Putin can take everything,” Burgis said. “However influential they may seem, they are ultimately dependent on him.”\n\nSeveral of Putin’s closest associates – including childhood friends, a woman who was reportedly his former lover, and a professional cellist who is the godfather of one of his daughters, have secretly amassed huge fortunes outside Russia during his time in power, according to leaked financial documents.\n\nA complicated web of shell companies, offshore banks and hidden transactions obscures their wealth, with accounts spirited away inside one another like Russian nesting dolls. But a series of leaks in recent years from firms that facilitate the offshore finance system, including the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers, have stripped away some of those layers of secrecy.\n\nThe assets tied to Putin’s inner circle include an apartment in a Monaco luxury building overlooking the principality’s glitzy harbor. The fourth-floor flat was purchased in 2003 for $4.1 million by a shell corporation called Brockville Development Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, documents published by The Washington Post show.\n\nThe real owner of the company: Svetlana Krivonogikh, a former shop cleaner from St. Petersburg who reportedly had a romantic relationship with Putin two decades ago, according to documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and reported on by the Post and The Guardian. The company was registered just weeks after Krivonogikh, who was 28 at the time, gave birth to a girl.\n\nProekt, an independent Russian media outlet that was banned in the country last year, reported that Putin started a relationship with Krivonogikh in the 1990s before he became President, and that her daughter has a patronymic middle name that means “daughter of Vladimir.”\n\nKrivonogikh has declined to comment about Putin to reporters, but her daughter – who had tens of thousands of Instagram followers before recently deleting her account – has acknowledged to interviewers that she shares a resemblance to the President.\n\nIn addition to the Monaco apartment, Krivonogikh owns a majority share in a ski resort where Putin has been seen hitting the slopes, several other luxury apartments in St. Petersburg, and a yacht, the Post and the Guardian reported.\n\nThe leaked documents don’t make clear the source of the fortunes amassed by Putin’s inner circle. But in several cases, businesses and financial institutions linked to them have won lucrative state contracts.\n\nRussia has the largest amount of wealth hidden in offshore tax havens, both in terms of absolute volume – conservative estimates peg it around $800 billion in 2017 – and as a percentage of national GDP, according to a 2020 report by the Atlantic Council.\n\nOn average, 10% of world GDP is held offshore. However, in Russia, offshore wealth accounted for as much as 60% of GDP in 2015, according to a 2018 Journal of Public Economics research paper, the most recent estimate available.\n\nExperts say about a quarter of this dark money is indirectly controlled by Putin and his tight-knit circle of oligarchs and poses a “serious national security threat” to the United States. The Mueller report illustrated how Russian offshore accounts were used to interfere in the 2016 elections.\n\nEarlier this month, the Justice Department announced the formation of a task force devoted to enforcing sanctions and other economic restrictions designed to isolate Russia from global markets. The KleptoCapture task force will target not only Russian officials and oligarchs, but “those who aid or conceal their unlawful conduct.”\n\nGary Kalman, the director of the US office of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group, said enforcing sanctions will not be easy.\n\n“It is extraordinarily difficult for law enforcement to try and ‘follow the money’ because at some point you are going to literally hit a brick wall,” Kalman said. “There is literally no paper trail.”\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom are ideal places to stash large amounts of money, they are among the deepest financial markets in the world, and both accept anonymous shell companies, according to the Atlantic Council.\n\nA group of international researchers found that shell companies in the US can be set up in under an hour for as little as $200, without having to legally disclose who owns or controls it. For decades, Western companies – banks and law firms – have profited from helping Russian oligarchs hide their money, setting up complicated corporate structures that make it nearly impossible to link assets or bank accounts to individuals.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, center, and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, right, watch the Navy Day Military parade on July 27, 2014, at the main naval base of Severomorsk, Russia. Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images\n\nIn the eyes of some longtime Putin observers, the enigmatic Russian leader has shifted his focus from pursuit of wealth to consolidation of power.\n\n“It’s difficult to understand precisely what’s happening inside the Kremlin and inside the mind of Vladimir Putin. But he is more and more in a tight relationship with a very small group of people, and they tend to be more on the military and intelligence side rather than business people,” said Jill Dougherty, former Moscow bureau chief for CNN, “because, obviously, if Putin cared about business, he would not be prosecuting this war in Ukraine.”\n\n“Right now it is not up to the oligarchs,” said Stanislav Markus, an associate professor of international business at the University of South Carolina. “It is the guns, not the money that speak loudest in the Kremlin today.”\n\nRegardless of whether priorities have shifted inside the Kremlin, Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, argues both the palace near the Black Sea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demonstrate the way Putin sees himself as much more than a government official.\n\n“He sees himself as a czar, as king of some sort,” Pevchikh told CNN. “He has huge plans. He has the vision of him being a historical figure, being so powerful, so mighty, so important, and they invest a lot of money into this narrative.”", "authors": ["Curt Devine Casey Tolan Majlie De Puy Kamp", "Curt Devine", "Casey Tolan", "Majlie De Puy Kamp"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/04/stefanie-lambert-sued-by-xrvision-in-pennsylvania-voting-machine-dispute/71051050007/", "title": "Stefanie Lambert sued by XRVision in voting machine dispute", "text": "A lawyer who enlisted Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan to access voting machines in Arizona, Michigan and Georgia is now accused of pushing a false election data report in Pennsylvania.\n\nA cybersecurity company is suing Stefanie Lambert, claiming she urged employees to manufacture findings in her efforts to overturn 2020 election results for Donald Trump's legal team.\n\nNew York-based XRVision claims Lambert hired the firm to analyze voting machines used by a rural Pennsylvania county in the 2020 election and asked employees to falsely report finding \"cheat codes\" in software and evidence of hacking.\n\nWhen employees refused to do her bidding, Lambert and her financial backer badmouthed the firm, damaging its reputation among members of the Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin senates and causing it to lose potential contracts, according to the lawsuit.\n\nXRVision's allegations — bolstered by information from a Pennsylvania whistleblower who says he has been interviewed multiple times by the FBI — underscore the coordinated campaign Trump allies undertook to keep him in the White House that is now the subject of state and federal prosecutions.\n\nAuthorities allege a multipronged criminal conspiracy that involved seizing and dismantling voting machines from counties in battleground states; pressuring state and federal lawmakers to nullify elections; convincing Republican electors in seven states to falsely certify Trump won; and prompting the Arizona Senate \"audit,\" which was the only private recount of public ballots in America.\n\nXRVision's lawsuit accuses Lambert of defamation and breach of contract. It also names Pennsylvania businessman Bill Bachenberg, who served as co-chair of a committee to reelect Trump and who helped establish the state's alternate slate of Trump electors in 2020.\n\nXRVision alleges Bachenberg agreed to fund attorney fees and expenses related to the Trump-fueled fraud investigations. Bachenberg gave Lambert a $1 million line of credit toward these efforts, and he determined \"which forensic experts to hire and which election controversies to pursue.\"\n\nXRVision and Cyber Ninjas were two of at least four companies Bachenberg secretly bankrolled through Lambert's Michigan law office, according to former Bachenberg employee and whistleblower Mike Ryan.\n\n\"She was the middleman for Bill Bachenberg's money,\" said Ryan, who worked for a Bachenberg-led nonprofit from January 2020 until November 2022.\n\nRyan told the USA TODAY Network that he met with the FBI in April and again in September to share evidence he collected, including information showing Lambert also hired two other cyber companies: Virginia-based CyFIR and Pennsylvania-based Wake Technology Services Inc.\n\nBoth companies later were hired by Logan to work as subcontractors on the hand recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County's 2020 election, which was authorized by the Arizona Senate.\n\nCyFIR founder Ben Cotton is a Trump supporter who at the height of the ballot recount took copies of Maricopa County's election data and its server to a remote cabin in Montana.\n\nRyan referred to Bachenberg's attempts to access voting machines as equipment \"audits.\"\n\n\"He was funding cyber firms to do election audits in several states,\" Ryan said in interviews. \"Bill Bachenberg's fingerprints are all over the cyber audits in all four states. He is the biggest name in the Republican Party that you've never heard of.\"\n\nBachenberg is the founder of the cybersecurity company DBSi. He is a self-made millionaire and Allentown resident. He owns Lehigh Valley Sporting Clays and has served on the National Rifle Association board.\n\nBachenberg could not be reached for comment.\n\nLambert could not be reached by phone Tuesday and did not respond to multiple email requests for interviews. She has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLambert, Logan connection stretched over months, multiple states\n\nLambert exchanged more than 2,400 text messages with Logan during the Arizona Senate's discredited \"audit,\" according to text messages obtained by The Arizona Republic as part of a public records lawsuit.\n\nText messages and court records show Lambert tapped Logan to analyze voting equipment in battleground states shortly after the Nov. 3, 2020, election.\n\nProsecutors with the Michigan Attorney General's Office say Logan was involved in taking apart five voting machines from three Michigan counties while holed up in a Detroit-area hotel room in April 2021 — just days after the Arizona Senate hired him to lead the \"audit.\"\n\nA Michigan grand jury indicted Lambert in August on multiple charges, including \"undue possession\" of a voting machine.\n\nLambert also is one of 30 unnamed and unindicted co-conspirators a Georgia grand jury accused of participating in a sweeping election conspiracy. Trump and 18 of his allies were charged in the case.\n\nLambert, who pleaded not guilty in Michigan, said all the cases were politically motivated. Logan was named in both cases but has not faced charges.\n\nText messages show Logan texted Lambert nearly every day — often dozens of times — from March 2021, before the ballot review began, to January 2022, months after it ended. Court records show Logan and Lambert were in contact even earlier.\n\nLogan and Lambert discussed their Michigan election investigation, the Department of Justice, \"audit\" fundraising, Dominion voting machines and putting \"liberal companies funding communism out of business,\" according to texts obtained by The Republic.\n\nLogan also bragged about his reach into the Arizona Senate, telling Lambert he could direct state lawmakers to do his bidding on claims of election fraud.\n\nThen-Senate President Karen Fann announced she'd chosen Cyber Ninjas on March 31, 2021. Although neither Logan nor his company had election auditing experience, Fann said he was \"well qualified\" and \"well experienced.\"\n\nThe hand count was supposed to take a few weeks and cost taxpayers $150,000. It ultimately took months and so far has cost Arizona more than $5 million.\n\nLogan said at a Sept. 24, 2021, Senate hearing the hand count showed President Joe Biden beat Trump in Maricopa County, and the numbers closely matched the county's certified election results from November. Logan's reports skimmed over the outcomes and focused on perceived voting irregularities.\n\nBut Logan privately admitted in text messages that he couldn't make sense of his own numbers, which he called \"screwy.\"\n\nFann repeatedly has refused to explain her decision to hire Logan. But records obtained by The Republic show she hired the Cyber Ninjas to lead the hand count after communicating with Trump loyalist Phil Waldron, who also worked with Lambert.\n\nAn investigation by The Republic published Oct. 2 found Waldron helped draft subpoenas the Arizona Senate used to seize Maricopa County election data for the \"audit.\" It was the first direct evidence that Trump's allies had steered the Senate's costly legal battle against the county as part of their efforts to overturn the election.\n\nLambert: Connected to election data forays in 4 states\n\nLambert is a common denominator in efforts by Republicans in four states to get data stored in Dominion voting machines.\n\nDominion is at the center of baseless conspiracy theories that election equipment was rigged in favor of Biden.\n\nWhen Trump publicly and falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen via cheating and fraud, local and state officials in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan acted to inspect their voting machines.\n\nA drive containing data election equipment from Georgia's Coffee County was addressed to Lambert and sent to a Michigan private investigator, the Detroit Free Press reported in August.\n\nThe shipment, detailed in court records, illustrates how data from a voting system breach in Georgia might have assisted experiments carried out on Michigan voting machines.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Lambert and Thomas Carroll — a Pottstown lawyer who was a top signatory on the alternate slate of electors with Bachenberg — became pro bono counsel for that rural Pennsylvania county.\n\nFulton County commissioners approved the pair on April 12, 2022.\n\nAt an August hearing over custody of the voting machines, Fulton County's legal counsel objected at least six times when lawyers for the Pennsylvania Department of State asked whether Lambert still worked for the county. A Republican commissioner finally confirmed it.\n\nLambert said in a Sept. 6 social media post that journalists should report on \"malicious python script installed by Dominion in Fulton PA with international communications.\"\n\nThe Python script refers to an unauthorized 2022 report on Fulton County voting machines by Michigan-based Speckin Forensics. Multiple attempts to interview Speckin about its findings have gone unanswered.\n\nCybersecurity company seeks damages from Bachenberg, Lambert\n\nXRVision is demanding $10 million in combined compensatory and punitive damages from Bachenberg and Lambert.\n\nBachenberg paid XRVision nearly $200,000 through Lambert for inspections of voting machines from Michigan's Antrim County, an endeavor labeled \"Project Sampson\" that took place between May 2021 and December 2021, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhen XRVision reported that the voting machines were not hacked or pre-configured to favor any particular candidates despite being \"highly insecure,\" the suit alleges that Bachenberg and Lambert became furious.\n\nAttorneys for the company also say Bachenberg and Lambert still owe the company $550,000 for its work on the voting machine inspections.\n\nXRVision's attorney said the case hasn't proceeded because the company has been unable to serve Bachenberg and Lambert.\n\nThe attorney said Lambert uses multiple name variations: Stefanie Lambert Junttila, Stefanie Lynn Lambert, Stefanie Lambert Neagos and Stephanie L. Serafinski.\n\nWhistleblower: 'The people have a right to know'\n\nRyan said Lambert and Bachenberg were working in concert with former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, who famously promised to \"release the Kraken\" in a series of voter fraud lawsuits that ultimately fizzled for lack of evidence.\n\nPowell was present for the widely reported Dec. 18, 2020, Oval Office meeting. She had urged Trump at that time to appoint her a special counsel and to seize voting machines across the country.\n\nLambert represented Powell in a 2021 Michigan sanctions case, arguing that Powell's statements challenging 2020 election results were \"legally opinion.\"\n\nPowell later said \"no reasonable person\" would believe her accusations about the rigging of Dominion voting machines were \"truly statements of fact.\"\n\nRyan said he became suspicious of Bachenberg's activities in 2021 after his boss bragged about his role as a fake elector. His suspicions deepened when Bachenberg contacted him on Jan. 5 and warned him to stay away from Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, Ryan said.\n\nHe said he soon discovered Bachenberg was paying Lambert and started collecting records about their meetings and collaborations with Cyber Ninjas, XRVision and Wake Technology and their \"voting machine schemes.\"\n\n\"I met with the FBI because I realized things weren't right,\" Ryan said, adding that he kept working with Bachenberg with the intention of collecting documents until he felt comfortable taking it all to federal agents.\n\nThat happened in in April, about six months after he left the company.\n\n\"April 7 was my first meeting with the FBI and special counsel's office,\" he said, referring to Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith. \"I turned over some documents and emails that still have not been made public. We discussed my boss, his travel to Mar-a-Lago, the White House and additional meetings in D.C..\"\n\nRyan said walking into the Washington field office was a surreal experience.\n\n\"The people have a right to know what happened with our nation's voting machines,\" he said.\n\nBruce Siwy is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network's Pennsylvania state capital bureau.

Has America changed? | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nPoetry’s genius is that it offers both an endless supply of words and a fresh way of looking at everything under the sun. As an example, the word “majusculation” – from the noun “majuscule,” meaning upper case or capital lettering (the inverse of “miniscule”) – in poetry refers to the capitalization of the first letter in every line of a poem.\n\nPoet and essayist Sumita Chakraborty has written that this convention of language “can give a poem majesty; the poem seems to stand upright, with all of its oblique and elliptical utterances yoked to the vertebrae of its left margin.”\n\nIf the poet’s use of capital letters can provide coherence – a figurative backbone – to a disordered world, it seems that former President Donald Trump’s haphazard capitalizations in his 14-page response to the House January 6 select committee on Friday did the opposite.\n\nTrump’s rage at the committee’s decision to subpoena him for documents and testimony about his role in the insurrection found voice in an all-caps opening line repeating his mendacious claims about the 2020 election. Thereafter, his upper cases were directed incoherently at enemies and allies alike – “Hacks and Thugs” and “American Patriots.”\n\nClay Jones\n\nThe chaos of Trump’s slapdash majuscules was one tiny measure of linguistic turmoil; this week, Americans were asked to confront much greater mayhem – yet again – when the January 6 committee held its last hearing before the midterm elections. In never-before-seen footage from that day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders were shown “scrambling to obtain more police and national guard forces to repel the rioters on Capitol Hill as they realized the threat was unfolding – not only to their personal safety but also to their ability to carry out their constitutional function of certifying the election,” wrote Julian Zelizer.\n\nAfter four months of highly staged televised hearings, Zelizer concluded: “The committee successfully unpacked the dark days that followed the 2020 election. They have been exposed in clear detail right in front of our eyes. The biggest mystery left is whether as a nation we will close our eyes and simply move forward without demanding accountability, justice and reform.”\n\nIn focusing this week’s hearing on Trump as a “central player” in the insurrection, according to Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, the committee failed to fully address the question of who else knew and bore ultimate responsibility, worried Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick.\n\nShe wrote, “The thing that keeps me up at night is the fact that the liars and the cheaters and the con men and the opportunists who allowed Jan. 6 to happen, and who minced their way into the Jan. 6 committee hearings two years later merely in order to exculpate themselves, will all roam free after today, with the slightly more burnished aura of statesmanship and patriotism, so they can lay down the tracks for the next attempt at a stolen election.”\n\nWhat comes next? The 2022 midterms now loom, and Manisha Sinha urged voters to look back to 1866 to grasp these ever-higher stakes. “Then, as now, armed paramilitary groups threatened the country,” she argued. “Some Republican candidates still aspire to overturn the results of the presidential election of 2020, just as unrepentant Confederates wanted to undo the results of the Civil War. A stolen election is the new lost cause mythology for many Republicans.”\n\nSaving democracy\n\nLiza Donnelly\n\nIn the next installment of CNN Opinion’s ongoing series, “America’s Future Starts Now,” three current and retired election workers – Natalie Adona of California, Lisa Deeley of Pennsylvania and Tina Barton of Michigan – shared the dangers they faced in the line of duty.\n\nDeeley, who faced a credible death threat after a video of her was posted online, recalled: “I had two plain-clothes Philadelphia police officers assigned to follow me wherever I went – including the bathroom.” Though this job has traditionally been a low-risk form of public service, since 2020 that reality has changed for these three women and many other officials who oversee federal, state and local elections.\n\nGiven that a majority of Americans believe US democracy is broken, 12 leading thinkers shared their ideas about how to repair it. One of them, US Marine veteran Joe Plenzler, pointed out that the “military – including its veterans – is one of the most trusted institutions in our society” and made the case for enlisting veterans as poll workers – both for their trustworthiness and for their trained abilities to deescalate tensions and address potential threats. Another participant, filmmaker Ken Burns, wrote: “To paraphrase historian Deborah Lipstadt who appears in my latest project, ‘The U.S. and the Holocaust,’ the time to save a democracy is before it is lost – and that requires people paying attention, filtering sources of news and beginning a politics of compromise built on conversation and storytelling now.”\n\nFor more:\n\nPatagonia CEO Ryan Gellert: Why business leaders should make it easier for employees to vote\n\n“Why does Russia bomb us, Mommy?”\n\nAnn Telnaes\n\nLast weekend, an explosion rocked a strategic Crimean bridge, delivering a heavy blow against Russian forces that prompted both jubilation and fear of Russian retribution in Ukraine. “On Monday, those fears were realized,” wrote Michael Bociurkiw from Odesa. “The strikes occurred nationwide just as people were headed to work and while kids were being dropped off at schools,” he observed. “One of the most resilient Ukrainians I know” texted: “I’m not well right now.”\n\nFor Nonna Stefanova, the attacks by “Russian missiles scorched a children’s playground in Kyiv that my family calls ‘our playground,’ leaving behind a gaping crater.” Russia’s nationwide bombardment demanded that she, like other Ukrainian mothers, rouse her family to seek shelter. Her son Askold, age nine, asked her, “Why does Russia do it?” Her answer: “I told him the truth: because the Russians don’t want us to exist.”\n\nDespite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression, his “so-far-disastrous invasion of Ukraine is turning the former idol of the far right into a toxic figure among many who used to be his greatest admirers,” opined Frida Ghitis after the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to reject Putin’s annexation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n“Leaders of the extreme right, seeing the transformation in popular opinion, have pivoted sharply. After championing a Russian leader who was already dictatorial and ruthless, they now seek to benefit from the economic havoc triggered by Putin’s war, while distancing themselves from a man who is now seen not only as a moral pariah by many of his followers, but also as a catastrophically ineffective leader.”\n\nFacing a uniquely American problem\n\ncourtesy Kathy Pisabaj\n\nThe corrosive trauma of mass shootings and gun violence in America – and the question of whether justice and accountability are even possible – took center stage this week in two courtrooms. In one, far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones faced judgment for defaming and intentionally inflicting emotional distress on the families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre; in another, a jury recommended that Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz spend life in prison without the possibility of parole for killing 17 people – avoiding the death penalty that many observers, some family members of the victims included, felt Cruz deserved.\n\n“Though many were shocked he didn’t receive the death penalty, and many victims’ family members were visibly upset by the decision, it’s wrong to assume this would have automatically brought them solace,” wrote Emilia Benton for NBC Think. Benton’s mother was murdered in 1998 by a man known as the “Railroad Killer,” and while he was executed for his crimes, “the sentencing and ultimate punishment he received in many ways made it more difficult to move forward in my life and achieve any sense of closure.”\n\nMoving forward after experiencing gun violence is never a linear process, reflected Katherine Pisabaj. “I always used to be the happiest, most cheerful person. That’s not who I am anymore. My life changed on February 25, 2018, the day I was shot,” Pisabaj wrote. “After years of healing, I am back to the most normal life I can now have. But recovering from this sort of trauma is not a straight path.\n\n“Last month was the first time I passed a shooting scene in Chicago since I was shot. I was on my way to the laundromat and drove by where three people had been shot. I fell apart. My boyfriend held my hand as my mom tried to comfort me over the phone. … I battle with anxiety and depression and sometimes feel so sad, even when I know I should be happy. It can be a constant battle.”\n\nFor more:\n\nGuns and crime weigh on Americans’ minds. 6 experts propose ideas to lighten the load\n\nJoey Jackson: School shooting verdicts raise questions about viability of justice system\n\nStudents reject Sasse\n\nAl Drago-Pool/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, a search committee unanimously recommended US Sen. Ben Sasse – a Republican from Nebraska, historian and former president of Midland University (student body less than 2,000) – as the sole finalist for president of the University of Florida (student body more than 60,000). When Sasse visited the school Monday, students turned out to protest.\n\nSasse’s impending appointment threatens to turn the University of Florida into a partisan plaything and “defiles the ideas of a public university of equity and as a common good,” contended David M. Perry. He wrote that not only would Sasse’s anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion politics have enormous sway in a place where queer students already feel threatened and many women receive health care from university-affiliated sources, but Sasse also got the job after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure decreasing transparency about applicants for college presidencies.\n\nThe Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin maintained that DeSantis’ agenda to bend his state’s flagship university to his personal political will was evident: “No one can seriously argue that Sasse is the finest candidate in the country for the position. DeSantis might as well have put in the job description: ‘Compliant Republican hostile to liberal ideas.’”\n\nCarlos Lozada framed his skepticism through the lens of having read Sasse’s “generic, forgettable” book “Them: Why We Hate Each Other — and How to Heal.” Wrote Lozada in the New York Times: “Books, like politicians, can impress on their own merits, or they can just sound good compared to the competition. No doubt, Sasse is more intellectually stimulating than the election-denying conspiracists who have overrun his Republican Party. But shouldn’t the bar remain higher than that?”\n\nHow (not) to respond to Kanye West\n\nJacopo M. Raule/Getty Images\n\nDays after Kanye West (along with right-wing influencer Candace Owens and group of models) appeared at Paris Fashion Week wearing shirts West had designed reading, “White Lives Matter,” he posted violent and antisemitic messages to Twitter and Instagram (both platforms removed posts and locked his accounts). Amid these latest developments, which follow his enmeshment in Trumpism and misogynist trolling of his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, many were asking: How should we respond to him this time?\n\nThere’s a lot we don’t know about Kanye West, but what “we do know is that the ideas Kanye is circulating are old, terrible, and powerful. They are death-dealing words,” wrote Imani Perry in her newsletter for The Atlantic. “And whenever someone who is widely influential traffics in such ideas, there is cause for alarm. The thing about ideologies of domination is that they aren’t individual possessions so much as accumulated beliefs and practices. Whether or not Kanye ‘means it’ is inconsequential to the question of whether his words are harmful. They are.”\n\n“The appropriate response to Kanye West’s latest intentional bigoted provocations,” wrote Jill Filipovic, “is fairly simple: Condemn the message, and encourage West, who reportedly struggles with mental health issues, to get help and get out of the public eye.”\n\nThe thorniest problem with that obvious course of action, noted Filipovic, is the “indecent and dangerous” embrace of West by extremist conservatives – notably Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita and Fox News personality Tucker Carlson – “who are using this moment to amplify themselves because they realize that West’s bigotry may well resonate with their followers.” The ongoing embrace of West on the right is “indefensible – and much more dangerous than a few tweets from a single musician,” Filipovic argued.\n\nDon’t miss\n\nPatrick T.

Ultimately, they showcased a self-confidence and sprawling talent that sealed her place as an all-time Hollywood icon,” wrote Holly Thomas of Angela Lansbury, who died this week at 96.\n\nLansbury was nominated for an Oscar for her very first film, “Gaslight,” in 1944, won multiple Tony Awards (including for legendary performances in “Mame,” “Gypsy,” “Sweeney Todd” and “Blithe Spirit”) and starred as Jessica Fletcher in the hit series “Murder, She Wrote.”\n\nShe coped with an industry that didn’t know what to make of her by casting off the ill-fitting labels of “starlet” or “character actor,” refusing to be confined to a single genre or archetype. She surpassed the limitations imposed on her as an actress in a career that spanned seven decades and left gender stereotypes in the dust – whether portraying villainous matriarch Eleanor Iselin in the 1962 political thriller “The Manchurian Candidate” or voicing the grandmotherly teapot Mrs. Potts in Disney’s 1991 animation, “Beauty and the Beast.”\n\nLansbury also used her star power on television to advocate for both herself and those with less clout – striking back against Hollywood’s pervasive ageism and misogyny. Marveled Thomas: “Her tenacity throughout her working life, setback after setback, year after year, ensured that new generations encountered her in an array of roles so diverse that when she was finally awarded her Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2013, Geoffrey Rush paid tribute to her as the ‘living definition of range.’ Now, when fans picture Angela Lansbury, they don’t see a starlet frozen in black and white, all tight curls and wide eyes. They see a grown woman, vital, in full color.”", "authors": ["Jane Greenway Carr"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/06/05/eric-bolling-newsmax-host-exits-the-balance/73982603007/", "title": "Eric Bolling, Newsmax host, leaves 'The Balance'", "text": "Bill Goodykoontz\n\nArizona Republic\n\nEric Bolling and Newsmax have parted ways after three years.\n\nIf you are not a devotee of far-right media, this might not mean much to you. In MAGA circles, however, it's a pretty big deal. Bolling was a prime-time host for the ultra-right-wing network; his show \"The Balance\" was one of Newsmax's most popular shows. The Daily Beast reported that Bolling and Newsmax reached a mutual agreement to end the show.\n\nA statement on Bolling's website said, \"After working together for three years to produce, present, and break news for the American people, it’s time for Eric to embark on new endeavors.

Where can I find a network that loves him even more?\"\n\nThat tactic worked for a time after the 2020 election after Fox News was the first network to report that Joe Biden had won Arizona, a victory that helped him secure the presidency.

He remained loyal to Trump, who he called his friend of decades.\n\nPresumably, he will continue to fawn over the former president. Bolling didn't say specifically what his next move would be, but his website says an announcement is coming in the next few weeks.\n\n\"The fight to inform the American people will remain paramount for Eric as he takes his audience on a new path with new partners,\" it says on the site.

She was a pushy 24-year-old Smith grad who refused to take a typing test.\n\n“Don’t you have a test for my mind?” she demanded.\n\nAs a matter of fact, P&G rigorously screened male applicants with a personality and intelligence test. So, OK, they could give her that.\n\nShe blew it out of the water.\n\nPeg Wyant’s early years represents a time when P&G ruled the planet. When it was the best work you could have or would ever hope to have. She stood at the apex of change, something that the company now faces many times over. But her P&G was one of growth, dominance and innovation.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWyant was already a budding entrepreneur in 1967. After graduating college and interning in Washington, D.C., she had launched a start-up (OK, so start-up wasn’t a word yet) tour business for students looking to reinforce their foreign language skills. It had successfully taken 250 high school students to Europe. Now, Wyant was looking to burnish her business skills in the corporate world.\n\nUnsure how to proceed, the human relations folks sent Wyant to lunch with a \"brand man.\" That was the title, no one had thought yet to call them brand managers. P&G women at the time were secretaries or low-level field researchers interviewing homemakers door-to-door.\n\nThat first lunch, the one where the brand man was supposed to talk some sense into her, was with future CEO John Pepper who recognized her as a trailblazer in his memoir ‘What Really Matters.’\n\nShe found herself in the job of an assistant brand manager – the first woman ever hired by the company’s legendary marketing department.\n\nP art 1: P&G vets wonder: Where’s the turnaround?\n\nPart 2: P&G and the engine that makes leaders\n\nPart 3: P&G: Now what?\n\n\n\nThree former P&Gers who went on to start new ventures:\n\nRodney Williams: The Pampers problem\n\nSameer Mungur: The plastic coffee can guy\n\nPeg Wyant: The woman who led the way\n\n\n\nThree former P&Gers recall their careers and why they left:\n\nEd Beckman: Ivorydale stalwart\n\nJamie Swafford: A perfect fit, then not\n\nBrad Morgan: Leaving the family business\n\nAs the 1960s became the 1970s, Wyant encountered both resistance and unexpected encouragement along the way. Before one early assignment, Wyant recalls one supervisor telling her “If you do well, you’ll be promoted – or you won’t and you’ll get your walking papers. But you won’t regret this experience.”\n\nWithin a few years of her hire, Wyant was promoted to sales rep then brand manager for Bonus detergent. She eventually held the same position leading Cascade dishwashing detergent and Gain laundry detergent.\n\n“I was Peg from ‘Mad Men,’” Wyant recalls, referring to the lead female character in the popular TV show that depicts the 1960s advertising world. “I was the woman they hired to be a secretary and said they’d promote me but didn’t want to. And you fought your way ahead. Back then, women were only hired as research secretaries, librarians and nurses.”\n\nAlong with her rise, company rules and policies, both small and large, had to be revisited. Women in the 1960s weren’t allowed to work after dark at P&G.\n\n“It was very well-meaning and very protective company,” recalls Wyant, 73.\n\nA bigger change came when Wyant was pregnant with her first child while she was the brand manager of Cascade. Women had always been asked to leave the company after the first trimester of pregnancy at P&G.\n\nShe convinced senior executives there was no medical reason to not let her continue working until she gave birth. And she also kept her position as brand manager, working from home for three months from home without pay.\n\nIn 1979, Wyant became the first woman to report to P&G’s CEO directly, helping John Smale plan long-term strategic initiatives. Wyant was part of a team researching where to expand P&G’s business, which led to the company’s push into health care and deeper into beauty.\n\nAfter giving birth to her fourth child, Wyant left P&G in 1986 and launched her own business venture. She went on to establish a real estate development company, Grandin Properties, which markets renovated historic apartments. She also founded Isabella Capital, a venture capital firm that specialized in female-owned businesses.\n\nToday Wyant is skeptical of the wisdom behind P&G’s brand sell-off and its retreat toward large brands and big countries. She recalls P&G used to nurture smaller, up-and-coming brands.\n\n“If we’d have done that in the 1940s, the '50s and '60s,\" Wyant said, \"we would have sold off Tide, Crest, Cascade, and Pampers.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/10/15/victorias-secret-fashion-show-how-to-watch/75683705007/", "title": "Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2024: Time, how to watch and more", "text": "The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is spreading its wings for the first time since 2018.\n\nThe retailer announced the return of its annual runway show in an Instagram video in May, saying, \"We've read the comments and heard you\" in response to its six-year hiatus.\n\nL Brands, the former parent company of Victoria's Secret, canceled the show in 2019, citing its decision to end the fashion show at the time to \"evolve the marketing of Victoria's Secret\" amid declining ratings and criticism about body positivity.\n\nThe show, which returns after a half-decade in its full form after the brand premiered a scaled down version on Prime Video last year, is slated to be broadcast Tuesday night from New York City.\n\nThe runway show, which was launched in 1995, has featured performances from A-list musical artists, including Rihanna, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd and Taylor Swift, and highlighted models like Heidi Klum and Kendall Jenner.

Studer grew up in the Chicago area following both the White Sox and Cubs teams and has marveled at Faust’s rare musical skills.\n\n“I have not met him, but I have been reading about him, so I know he is a wonderful fella,” said Faust who retired in 2010 after playing for 41 consecutive years at White Sox games and becoming an institution in Chicago.\n\nWahoos Weekly: After series split on road, Blue Wahoos back home to face Smokies\n\nMore Blue Wahoos: Former Blue Wahoos broadcasters living dream as MLB voices at same ballpark\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nThrough arrangements to locate a version of the renown Hammond B3 Musical Organ that Faust made famous during yesteryear, she will play at the Blue Wahoos games on Saturday night and Father’s Day Sunday to close out the team’s series against the Tennessee Smokies.\n\n“I know you all (Blue Wahoos) had to jump through a lot of hoops and that’s just amazing,” Faust said, during an interview while she was grocery shopping in Chicago. “I am pinching myself that you have been so wonderful to me. I’m excited to be dusting off the keys and playing again for you.”\n\nIn so many ways, Faust was a pioneer before stadiums had video boards, computerized graphics and sound systems providing entertainment. She entertained as a renown organist, sitting among the fans, and leading the game experience.\n\nAs a Father’s Day gift, Studer’s wife, Rishy, wanted to see if Faust could travel to Pensacola and entertain at a Blue Wahoos game.\n\nIt all came together when Mike Fitzpatrick, the Blue Wahoos facilities manager, used a special connection with Faust to see if she could make a trip Father’s Day weekend to Pensacola.\n\nFitzpatrick, a Chicago native, along with his business partner, owned a famous bar in Chicago, the Cork and Kerry. In 2005 when the White Sox won the World Series, he arranged for Faust to play at the bar/restaurant the night of the White Sox clinching game.\n\n“We were long time White Sox fans, season ticket holders and we thought it be great idea to get her in the bar to play and help celebrate the White Sox winning the World Series,” Fitzpatrick said. “We were able to get her in the bar and got an organ set up and she stayed the whole night.\n\n“It was an unbelievable night and she still remembered it when I called her. She knew who I was and even said she had still had pictures from that night. She told me, ‘If you can get the organ, I will try and come down.’ So we started planning this before the season. The hardest part of all this was keeping a secret from a man (Studer) who knows everything going on in the community.”\n\nThe next challenge was finding a Hammond B3 Organ. Firtzpatrick learned Pensacola had an organ group and contacted the director, who put him in touch with Tommy Durant and the organ was tested at the stadium to make sure it would work.\n\n“I told (group director) what we wanted to do and he was excited about the whole thing. So he helped me try and found someone with a Hammond B3 and Tommy came through,” Fitzpatrick said.\n\n“I knew how much this would mean to Quint,” Fitzpatrick said. “He had sent me a video of Nancy Faust and said how he loved the old baseball games and talked about how much he loved Nancy playing the organ at White Sox games. So that hardest part was just getting the organ that I knew Nancy had to have in order to play here.”\n\nFaust was hired in 1970 by baseball’s famed innovator, Bill Veeck, while he was the White Sox general manager. Faust quickly became a hit with White Sox fans and sports fans through the nation when learning of her entertaining skills as organist.\n\nShe quickly rose in fame as a pioneer woman playing an organ at Major League Baseball games. She became the first organist to include pop and rock themes. Her placement at the White Sox former Comiskey Park was among the fans, enabling them to request songs that she then played during the game.\n\n“I didn’t know a lot about baseball, but the fans who surrounded me certainly did,” Faust said. “So, they gave me a lot of insight and suggestions for songs. All I needed was a suggestion and I could play it. And it was a good marriage between the fans and myself and I loved being outside with them.\n\n“Bill Veeck was a cutting edge guy and he thought the organist should be visible and I benefitted from that,” she said. Uusally organists are tucked away someplace where people don’t know if it’s real or Memorex.”\n\nFaust was the first to lead “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” preceding former White Sox, then Cubs iconic broadcaster Harry Caray, who then followed by singing his version of the song from the press box.\n\nFaust also created the famed “Nah Na Nah, Hey, Hey, Kiss Him Goodbye” theme song that is played worldwide at sporting events. She is recognized with a display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. New York She was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary’s Shrine of Eternals.\n\nWhen the Miami Marlins franchise was formed and prior to their 1993 inaugural season, Faust was invited to attend the logo unveiling. She then was asked to play in the Marlins first game.\n\nAll these years later, Faust is hoping a first-time trip to Pensacola and this unique experience will resonate with Blue Wahoos fans.\n\n“I wonder what the fans will think,” she said. “It could be quite a novelty for someone young, because I wouldn’t think they are familiar with organs. But since youngsters seem to jump from one thing to another, they may find it a novelty and amusing.\n\nAnd hopefully evoke some great feelings with their fathers and their families on Father’s Day. Because the sound itself of an organ is kind of unique to baseball. They still use it for commercials.\n\n“I like to think I created a dimension in entertainment that was unique to a ballpark. Back then, I like to feel that people went home entertained, win or lose, and that was part of a good time at the ballpark.”\n\nBill Vilona is a retired Pensacola News Journal sports columnist and now senior writer for Pensacola Blue Wahoos.

Ocean Blvd., which the family would own until selling it in 1995.\n\nAbove all, it was a private getaway where an insular family with a high public profile could spend time together, with gatherings eventually including in-laws and countless other extended family members.\n\nEnter JFK, known from childhood as Jack.\n\nA sickly child, he’d face health issues that called for recuperation and private tutors in warm Palm Beach, including in 1934 after collapsing at a Northeast prep school due to a low blood count and fever.\n\nHe and the family enjoyed annual Christmas and spring visits to the island, which included touch football on the oceanfront lawn.\n\nMass at St. Edward Catholic Church on North County Road was often followed by burgers across the street at Green’s Pharmacy, which opened in 1938 and remains popular to this day.\n\n“He was a hell of a nice kid who’d hang out around the drugstore drinking Cokes and reading our magazines and newspapers,” the late Green’s Pharmacy founder Murray Green once said.\n\nJust south on North County Road, the Kennedy kids jockeyed for seats at The Paramount Theatre, a 1927-founded movie palace and performance hall that now combines retail, office and other uses.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1940, Jack stayed with his dad in Palm Beach for six weeks with friends.\n\nHe’d be back again for extended stays after his harrowing experiences as a PT boat commander in World War II and then spinal surgery in 1954 after marrying Jacqueline Lee Bouvier in 1953.\n\nDuring his monthslong 1954 recuperation, JFK, then a U.S. senator, wrote his Pulitzer Prize-winning “Profiles in Courage.”\n\nWhen up to it during that rehab, he and Jackie strolled Worth Avenue, where JFK is said to have been partial to Stinchfield’s sportswear shop.\n\n“He was like anybody else, in penny loafers with no socks and khaki slacks, shopping and looking in the windows,” late Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce President Jesse Newman said.\n\nThat would change after JFK defeated Richard Nixon in November 1960 to become the youngest president elected in the U.S.\n\nThe curtain went up on Palm Beach Camelot.\n\nIt starred the 35th president, his beautiful wife and their two adorable children: 3-year-old Caroline and younger brother John. Jr.\n\nThe new first couple would spend holidays and spring vacations in Palm Beach along with other Kennedy family members and their spouses — including Hollywood hunk Peter Lawford — bringing glamour and vitality to a conventional resort town.\n\nJackie Kennedy, who in Palm Beach often wore casual Lilly Pulitzer shifts (and called Lilly a friend), might be spotted shopping. Her husband loved playing golf (often at Palm Beach Country Club), swimming in the ocean and driving around town in his Lincoln convertible and later a blue T-Bird.\n\nHe chose Palm Beach as the place to plan his administration.\n\nArriving via motorcade with Jackie, Caroline and sleeping infant John Jr. in December 1960, local girls “squealed with delight as the President-elect’s car rounded the N. Ocean Blvd. curve,” The Palm Beach Post reported. An adult among them shouted, “Don’t wake the baby!”\n\nThe president-elect’s staff members moved into temporary offices at then-recently built Palm Beach Towers on Cocoanut Row. Press Secretary Pierre Salinger held press conferences there; speechwriter Ted Sorensen worked by the pool.\n\nAt The Colomy Hotel, the Secret Service installed special phone lines connected to the White House switchboard.\n\nFrom the family’s North Ocean Boulevard estate, JFK introduced North Carolina Gov. Luther Hodges as his new Commerce secretary.\n\nHe also worked on his inaugural address, but there was always time for Jackie and the kids. “You could hear their laughter echoing throughout the house,” brother Ted Kennedy once recalled.\n\nKennedy was almost assassinated in Palm Beach at this time.\n\nIn December 1960, a deranged anti-Catholic New Hampshire postal worker, Richard Paul Pavlick, planned to ram Kennedy’s car in the president-elect’s motorcade as it headed to Mass at St. Ed’s.\n\nPavlick aborted his plan at the last minute, but Palm Beach Police arrested him on Dec. 15 in his 1950 Buick, in which they found seven sticks of dynamite and a detonator. (Pavlick later was found incompetent for trial and sent to a New Hampshire hospital. He died in 1975).\n\nThat didn’t deter continued Kennedy visits to Palm Beach.\n\nThe president kept up his golf here, including with such partners as Lawford, Bing Crosby, Chris Dunphy and ambassador Earl E.T. Smith, who served as the town’s mayor from 1971 to 1977.\n\nIt was an “exciting” era, Newman said. “I think the town definitely had this philosophy that ‘he belongs to us.’”\n\nWhere and when might Kennedy appear on the island? The late Palm Beach-based lensman Ken Davidoff often knew. The Kennedys trusted him and even invited him into their home to take photos.\n\nAs the family’s “official Palm Beach photographer,” Davidoff — whose collection of images make up the 2008 “The Kennedy Family Album: Personal Photos of America’s Furst Family”— once recalled how JFK’s Palm Beach antics to outwit the Secret Service were legendary: “He would suddenly take off and go to Worth Avenue shopping or go to Green’s and get a soda.”\n\nIn 1961, the Secret Service and a contingent of Navy Seabees secretly built a bomb shelter on Peanut Island for JFK in case of nuclear war. Kennedy is said to have visited the bunker twice.\n\nJoe Kennedy, 73, suffered a stroke after a Palm Beach golf game in December of 1961, leaving him partially paralyzed.\n\nBut the First Family continued regular visits. While guests at the nearby Palm Beach home of C. Michael Paul during Christmas in 1962, the Kennedy kids and children of friends put on a Christmas pageant watched by JFK, Jackie and many other members of the clan.\n\nJFK’s last Palm Beach visit: the weekend before he was shot.\n\nAfter quiet time with his dad and jaunts elsewhere in Florida for political and press events on Nov. 15 and 16, he went to Sunday Mass at St. Ann Catholic Church in West Palm Beach.\n\nThe next morning, he left Palm Beach. He’d be assassinated by a gunshot wound to the head on Nov. 22 as his motorcade drove along the streets of Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe tragedy is newly told in color in a new documentary, “JFK: One Day in America,” that began streaming Nov. 5 on the National Geographic Channel.\n\nThe day Kennedy left Palm Beach for the last time, resident Phyllis Hoffman was driving in her red Porsche near the Southern Boulevard traffic circle when she saw the president’s motorcade.\n\n“The president was in front in his baby-blue Thunderbird convertible with Pierre Salinger driving, and there were two cars behind him with Secret Service men and I think a Palm Beach police car bringing up the rear,” the late Hoffman recalled a decade ago. “I waved to him as he left town. I think about that so often, you can't imagine.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/29/dont-make-us-move-to-delaware-politico-on-potential-biden-hq/69761044007/", "title": "Some pushback on Delaware as Biden's '24 campaign headquarters", "text": "At least Bardea Food & Drink got a shoutout.\n\nWhen Politico published a recent report about Philadelphia and Wilmington emerging as leading contenders for President Joe Biden's potential 2024 campaign headquarters, Delaware didn't get much love.\n\n\"The possibility of a Wilmington-based campaign has elicited some strong feelings among the Democratic political class, who have grumbled about the city’s sleepy nightlife and restaurant scene,\" read the political news website's popular West Wing Playbook newsletter on Dec. 22 under the headline \"Dela-really?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/iowa/basketball-women/2024/05/15/jan-jensen-iowa-womens-basketball-hawkeyes-press-conference-beth-goetz-lisa-bluder-retirement/73684763007/", "title": "How Iowa women's basketball, Beth Goetz quickly hired Jan Jensen", "text": "IOWA CITY − Jan Jensen’s dream job officially arrived Monday, with the announcement that she would be the next head women’s basketball coach for the University of Iowa.\n\nWhile Jensen had essentially been working for this particular moment for 32 consecutive years as Lisa Bluder’s trusted assistant coach, there was approximately zero time for celebration.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/04/13/woman-running-her-25th-straight-boston-marathon/82817280/", "title": "Woman running her 25th straight Boston Marathon", "text": "Todd McMahon\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nWaldron can become first Wisconsin runner on active list of completing 25 straight Boston Marathons.\n\nThe Allouez resident also is looking to finish her 100th marathon since 1991 in Monday's race.\n\nALLOUEZ - Kathy Waldron has run and won numerous races across the United States. She even has returned from Jamaica with prize money in hand.\n\nYet no distance event keeps bringing Waldron back year after year like a legendary April race on the East Coast. More than 50 years after she had her first exposure to the Boston Marathon, Waldron is poised to attain a big feat with her ever-moving feet.\n\nThe 57-year-old can join an exclusive club on Monday if she’s able to finish the 26.2-mile race. It will mark her 25th consecutive finish of the race.\n\n“It’s going to be a special moment,” said Waldron's daughter, Sarah Finnel, who will accompany her mother and other family to Boston this weekend. “I’m just really excited to be there and share that with her because it’s such a big deal.”\n\nHow big?\n\nThe sponsoring Boston Athletic Association counts just 76 runners on its active list who have completed 25 or more consecutive Boston Marathons. Only six are women.\n\nWaldron can become the first Wisconsin resident to join the list, which is dubbed the “Quarter Century Club.\"\n\n“You still see some of the people that I never even met, never knew their name, and I still see their faces, and we say hi,” said Waldron, a school-bus driver who has two adult children and two grandkids.\n\nThe 120th running of the Boston Marathon carries added significance for Waldron. The Brillion native and longtime Green Bay-area resident can get to 100 completed marathons if she crosses the finish line on Boylston Street near the Boston Public Library in the early afternoon Monday.\n\n‘Bound and determined’\n\nWaldron's pursuit of two major milestones on the same day is a testament to her endurance, say those who have known her a long time.\n\n“Running, you can do the rest of your life, and she’s proving that to be true,” said Glen Seering, a retired cross-country and track and field coach at Brillion High School, Waldron’s alma mater.\n\nSeering considers Waldron a pioneer at the rural Calumet County school. In the mid-1970s, she was one of the first girls to run with the boys during cross-country season when Brillion didn’t have a girls team.\n\nWaldron won a WIAA state title in the 1600-meter run in 1975.\n\n“She was bound and determined,” Seering recalled.\n\nThat desire to excel as a runner started long before Waldron entered high school. She remembers being distracted from her after-school chores on her family’s dairy farm when Seering's runners trotted by on training runs.\n\n“I used to think, ‘I can beat those boys!’” Waldron said.\n\nShe set her sights on running the Boston Marathon, which she discovered as a 5-year-old listening to that year’s race results on the radio.\n\n“We always ran on the farm,” said Waldron, the sixth-oldest of 12 children. “We had no toys, and we used to fight and chase each other.”\n\nThe small-town girl’s dream of running the prestigious race in the big city came true with her first appearance in the marathon in April 1992. She qualified for the race the previous fall by finishing 20 minutes faster than the qualifying standard of 3 hours, 30 minutes in the first marathon she completed — the Fox Cities Marathon in Appleton.\n\nFinnel remembers the jubilation she felt as a young child when her mom earned the chance to run in Boston.\n\n“My mom ran my whole life, and her big goal was to make it to Boston,” said Finnel, 33.\n\nFinnel and her older brother, Nicholas, joined Waldron’s parents, Lester and Dorothy Kocourek, for Waldron’s Boston Marathon debut. Lester Kocourek also ran the marathon that year, when family members and others were allowed to run as unregistered “bandits” at the back of the pack.\n\nThat was the only year Waldron’s parents made the trip to support her at Boston. Her father died of prostate cancer shortly after the 1993 race, and her mother died a year later from liver cancer.\n\n“When I go there, I think of them so much,” Waldron said. “I feel like they’re right there with me.”\n\nShe said her dad was buried with her first Boston Marathon medal.\n\n“He supported me from Day 1, when I didn’t even know what (the race) was,” Waldron said. “He told me he believed that I could run the Boston Marathon.”\n\nSome years later, Waldron said, Bellin Health President and CEO George Kerwin, a longtime running acquaintance, gave her a replacement medal to add to her collection.\n\nStill going strong\n\nWaldron said the secret to more than 40 years of competitive running is to stay off pavement as much as possible when she trains for a handful of marathons each year.\n\nHer one close call for not running the Boston Marathon, much less finishing it, came two years ago, when she slipped on a patch of ice on her driveway while going to work.\n\nThe bone bruise in her left knee kept her off her feet for six weeks. She managed to drive to Boston, ran the first portion of the race at a slow pace and then shuffled along the rest of the way. She finished in 4 hours, 54 minutes — her worst time in the race.\n\n“That was painful,” Waldron said. “But, I cannot tell you how thankful I was” to still participate.\n\nHer best Boston time is 3:01, when she finished 53rd among women in 1998.\n\nShe hopes to run Monday’s race in less than four hours. Boston Athletic Association spokesman Marc Davis said those who complete 25 straight Boston Marathons won’t have to qualify for the race in future years as long as they break the six-hour mark each year.\n\n“Getting motivated by seeing the boys (back in the day), I think that was a good indication of what was to come,” Seering said. “She broke a lot of ground and got a lot of kids interested. She set the example.”\n\nWaldron is inspiring the next generation of runners. Finnel’s 3-year-old son, McCoy, who is making the trip this weekend, likes to tell his grandmother that he will win the Boston Marathon when he’s older.\n\nJust maybe, Waldron still will be running the race.\n\n“If she can ... she will run until she’s 90 years old,” Finnel said.\n\ntmcmaho2@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @ToddMcMahon23", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2021/03/18/hot-springs-national-park-arkansas-celebrates-100-years/4710311001/", "title": "Hot Springs National Park celebrates centennial", "text": "Nestled in the lush, green hills of central Arkansas lies a 100-year-old, 5,500-acre national park where history and conservation meet tourism and urban living.\n\nIt's a bustling city with no direct interstate access.

Now you need a mask. Here's what to know about new NPS rule.\n\nYou can even live in the park, as the borders encompass some historic residential areas.\n\nThe Valley of the Vapors\n\nIt's said the Native American tribes called Hot Springs the Valley of the Vapors. Legend has it that several tribes agreed to put aside their weapons to partake of the healing waters in peace.\n\n\"That's largely mythology,\" explained Larry Foley, chair of the journalism department at the University of Arkansas. Foley produced the documentaries \"The Forgotten Expedition\" and \"The First Boys of Spring,\" chronicling the history of Hot Springs.\n\nThe land would go on to be explored by Hernando de Soto, Father Marquette and Joliet. When President Thomas Jefferson sent explorers William Dunbar and George Hunter in 1804, there were already small cabins built by those who would visit to enjoy the springs.\n\nDunbar and Hunter were sent out at the same time as Lewis and Clark, with the goal of reaching the source of the Arkansas River, a goal sidelined when Jefferson pulled the explorers back out of fear they would be killed by the Native American tribes further north.\n\n\"They probably heard about it through trappers and such,\" Foley said. \"They begged Jefferson to let them explore the waters.\"\n\n\"They had their 15 minutes of fame because the other expedition wasn't back yet,\" Foley said of Hunter and Dunbar, who were the first to publish their findings. \"Once Lewis and Clark got back, everyone forgot about Hunter and Dunbar.\"\n\nThe town built by spring water\n\nThe area that grew up around the springs would eventually become the city of Hot Springs, Arkansas. Older than the state of Arkansas, it was already becoming a settled area by the time the territory was established in 1819.\n\nIn 1832, President Andrew Jackson declared it Hot Springs Reservation, the first of its kind, specifically to protect the area's natural spring waters, which boast minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. This makes Hot Springs older than the National Park Service by 84 years and one of the oldest federally-protected lands in the country.\n\n\"They wanted to make sure an individual or a company couldn't come in and exploit the springs,\" park superintendent Laura Miller said.\n\nThe thermal water in the springs emerges from Hot Springs Mountain. Rain enters cracks in the brittle rock formations at the tops of the mountains, and gravity slowly pulls it into the Earth. It springs out of the ground on the west slope of the mountain. The NPS preserves 47 thermal springs with an average temperature of 147 degrees.\n\nOn March 4, 1921, the reservation became Hot Springs National Park, officially the 17th park in the system, even though as a federally protected land it predates Yellowstone. The park service collects and distributes thermal water to the bathhouses and public fountains.\n\n\"They made people feel good,\" Foley said. \"Hot Springs motto was 'We bathe the world.'\"\n\nThe town published all kinds of different claims that bathing in its waters could cure everything from alcoholism to \"conditions of women.\"\n\n\"Basically, you would go in, sit in the waters for a while, then go into another area and cool off and sip the water,\" Miller said of the bathhouses, though other services were offered, including massage and mercury rubs, the primary treatment for syphilis until the advent of penicillin.\n\nNow, the eight bathhouses that make up the famed Bathhouse Row offer guests everything from a craft brewery to a visitors center and a boutique hotel, with two facilities still functioning as bathhouses.\n\nThe birthplace of spring training\n\nIn 1886, Cap Anson brought his Chicago White Stockings to Hot Springs to train, hoping the thermal waters would help sober up the players following the winter.\n\n\"They found a goat pasture and cleared out a baseball field and soaked in the baths, and they won the pennant,\" Foley said.\n\nThe White Stockings would eventually become the Cubs, and Hot Springs would become the first home for baseball's spring training, drawing legends of the sport including Cy Young, Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron.\n\nBefore he was traded to the Yankee's, Babe Ruth would travel to Hot Springs with the Red Sox.\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day in 1918, Ruth was pitching during a spring training game, when he volunteered to bat. Not yet considered the powerhouse hitter he would become, he surprised everyone when he belted the ball over 500 feet into a pond at the nearby alligator farm.\n\n\"Babe loved to go to Hot Springs because he could gamble and carouse – which he did,\" Foley said.\n\nEven though the greats no longer train in Hot Springs, visitors can still follow in their footsteps along the \"Hot Springs Baseball Trail,\" a self-guided tour full of baseball history.\n\nThe age of the gangster\n\nProhibition saw the arrival of gangsters and bootleggers to Hot Springs.\n\n\"I can't imagine them wanting to be on federal lands, but they certainly were here,\" Miller said.\n\nThe most notable of the legendary crime lords to enjoy Hot Springs was Al Capone, who had visited as a child and would eventually own a suite in the famed Arlington Hotel, which housed a secret passage through tunnels that ran underground and allowed him to pass between the hotel and the Ohio Club, Arkansas' oldest bar.\n\nCapone would strike moonshine deals while in Hot Springs and bring his product back to Chicago in clear glass bottles labeled Mountain Valley Water, mimicking the legitimate business Mountain Valley Spring Water that bottled the thermal spring water in green glass bottles. Mountain Valley Spring Water is still in operation today.\n\nA Capone statue sits on a bench outside the Ohio Club, welcoming guests to one of his favorite haunts.\n\nThe Black-owned bathhouses\n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, Black Arkansans who worked in the bathhouses were not allowed to use the facilities they staffed.\n\n\"Segregation wasn't allowed on federal lands,\" Miller said. \"But we were in Arkansas, so it certainly was practiced.\"\n\nFor a time, Black people could purchase a ticket to use the services, such as massages or thermal baths, but were not allowed to use them at the same time as white patrons.\n\nThe government opened their own bathhouse, which was not segregated; but as a medical facility, those who used it had to claim to be indigent.\n\n\"This put a lot of people in a place where they had to lie just to get medical care,\" Miller said.\n\nAs a response, Black-owned bathhouses began popping up. The most famous becoming the National Baptist Hotel.\n\nBuilt in 1923 as the Woodmen of the Union Building and designed by Tuskegee Institute architect W.T. Bailey, it would become a hotel, bathhouse and performance venue known as the center of Black culture in Hot Springs.\n\nThe building contained a 100-bed hospital and nurse training school, a 75-room bath hotel, bank, a 2,500-seat auditorium, printing plant and executive offices.\n\nIt hosted nearly every great Negro League player and entertainer who visited the city, including Count Basie and Duke Ellington.\n\n\"Satchel Paige, about as long as he played, he went to Hot Springs,\" Foley said of the pitching great, noting ballplayers visiting Hot Springs predated the major leagues.\n\nBill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, who was a close friend of Babe Ruth and part owner of the New York Black Yankees, stayed in this hotel/bathhouse. It's said he would lead parades through town, dancing the entire route.\n\nThe African American National Baptist Convention bought the Woodmen of the Union Building in 1948, and it hosted the annual National Baptist Association Convention until the early 1980s.\n\nHot Springs National Park now\n\nThough the myths, legends and history surround Hot Springs are larger than the second-smallest national park, visitors can still find something to enjoy. Follow the baseball trail, enjoy the bathhouses, hike the trails, fish, bike and just enjoy the natural beauty and history.\n\nThe March 4 anniversary kicked off a series of planned online and in-person anniversary events to celebrate the centennial of Hot Springs National Park, including a parkwide BioBlitz in May, a 1921-themed Block Party in June, a B.A.R.K. Ranger Day celebration in July, a Junior Ranger Day celebration in August, a Thermal Springs Festival in September, an Archaeology Day celebration in October, and a Park Rx weekend in November.\n\nWhile the park islooking forward to hosting in-person events as the year progresses, events and details are subject to change as necessary due to the coronavirus pandemic. After all, well-being is at the core of Hot Springs' history.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/18"}]}

President Joe Biden may get a boost in swing states with yearly inflation rates below the U.S. average – such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – especially if they edge close to 2% by November.\n\nYet Georgia, another swing state, still grapples with relatively high inflation, possibly aiding former President Donald Trump. And while price increases have slowed in Arizona, its cumulative gain since early 2021 is among the nation's largest.\n\nGenerally, inflation has been higher in the South and West because Americans have flocked to those regions for favorable climates and lower costs, pushing up consumer demand and prices, especially for housing. It’s been lower in the Northeast and Midwest, with many residents leaving those areas, easing cost pressures.\n\nWhich states did people move to during the pandemic?\n\nThose decadeslong migration trends were intensified by the pandemic as people bolted from densely populated cities like New York and Chicago for smaller towns with open spaces and lower costs, such as Boise, Idaho, and Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nNow that many companies are requiring staffers to return to the office, at least some of the time, price pressures have partly swung back, says Moody’s regional economist Adam Kamins.\n\nInflation in Mountain West states like Utah, Idaho and Arizona led the nation at more than 10% in June 2022, according to Moody’s. But skyrocketing housing costs, along with return-to-office mandates, have dampened migration to the area. In February, inflation in the region was among the nation’s lowest at about 2.5%.\n\nBy contrast, price increases in California, Hawaii and New York peaked at a relatively modest 7% to 8% in June 2022. People were leaving cities like San Francisco, New York and Honolulu in droves for less expensive and less hazardous areas. But as the pandemic has faded, many people have returned to those cities and fewer are departing, renewing cost squeezes. Inflation is about 3.6% in California and 3.5% in Hawaii, based on Moody’s estimate of the three-month average.\n\nMountain West residents may feel better now that inflation is softening and those in California and Hawaii may be more frustrated. Yet perceptions may be shaped more by cumulative price increases since early 2021, Kamins says. On that basis, Utah’s prices, for example, are up 19.3% – above the 18.5% U.S. average – while California’s have risen 16.7%.\n\nHere’s a look at the five states with the highest annual inflation the past year and the five states with the lowest price gains based on Moody's three-month average.\n\nThe five states with the fastest inflation:\n\nFlorida\n\n12-month inflation: 3.9%\n\nAmericans have streamed into the Sunshine State since the pandemic for its warm weather, beaches and lower costs, especially compared to the Northeast. The state gained 194,000 more residents than it lost last year, according to Moody’s and Census Bureau figures, driving up the cost of single-family homes and rent.\n\nThe state is attracting many high-income consumers, including both workers and retirees, Moody’s Kamins and Zandi say. The influx also has pushed up the cost of food, furniture and other goods and services. Groceries are among the most expensive in the country, with the average family spending nearly $300 a week, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nMeanwhile, damaging hurricanes in recent years have caused homeowners insurance to skyrocket. The average annual premium costs $8,770, about four times the national average, according to moneygeek, a personal finance website.\n\nTennessee\n\n12-month inflation: 3.8%\n\nAs home prices soared in larger metro areas, many Americans sought refuge in Tennessee for its more affordable housing, big-city amenities in Nashville, diverse economy and robust job opportunities. The trend accelerated during the pandemic, Kamins says.\n\nMajor corporations such as FedEx and AutoZone are based there and the state boasts a thriving auto assembly hub.\n\nLast year, Tennessee added 63,000 more residents than it lost, pushing up the cost of housing and other services. Its 3.3% unemployment rate, below the nation’s 3.8%, has increased wages and the cost of services.\n\nBut while housing prices have climbed higher, they didn’t vault as sharply as they did in the Mountain West, Kamins says. And so many Americans who moved to the state’s rural areas during the pandemic have stayed and are working remotely even as the health crisis has eased.\n\nVirginia\n\n12-month inflation: 3.8%\n\nThe state has drawn residents, particularly to Northern Virginia, as the federal government in nearby Washington, D.C., has beefed up staffing following legislation to expand investments in infrastructure, chip manufacturing and clean energy, Zandi says.\n\nBut the area, a vibrant technology hub, has struggled to attract enough skilled workers to staff the numerous tech companies that have moved to the region, Kamins say, nudging wages and inflation higher. Unemployment is just 3%.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n12-month inflation: 3.6%\n\nThe state, the fastest-growing in the country, boasts a robust tourism industry in Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach and a vibrant manufacturing sector centered around BMW in the Upstate area and Boeing in Charleston.\n\nAbout 82,000 more people moved to the state than left last year, the Moody’s and Census figures show, pushing housing and other prices higher.\n\nAlabama\n\n12-month inflation: 3.6%\n\nThe state attracted residents during the pandemic and many have stayed and are working remotely, Kamins says.\n\nMeanwhile, its large stable of manufacturers has been expanding, S&P's Kuykendall says, including Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Airbus. The unemployment rate is 3%.\n\nInflation has picked up off of a low-cost base, Kamins says.\n\nThe five states with the slowest inflation:\n\nPennsylvania\n\n12-month inflation: 1.8%\n\nPennsylvania is among the few states that have lost population as residents have fled to the Mountain West and South for lower costs, scenic beauty or more mild temperatures.\n\nSince residents of the Keystone State do lots of driving, gasoline costs carry more weight in a basket of goods and services and the decline in gas prices over the past 18 months has helped lower inflation overall, Kamins says.\n\nMaine\n\n12-month inflation: 1.9%\n\nMaine got a big boost during the pandemic as residents of larger New England cities such as Boston moved to the less populated area, Kamins says. But that has stalled and partly reversed as the pandemic has faded.\n\nMeanwhile, he says, its population has a disproportionate share of older residents who tend to spend less, keeping prices from rising sharply.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n12-month inflation: 2%\n\nLike Maine, New Hampshire attracted residents from larger cities during the pandemic but the trend has petered out.\n\nThe state also has an older population that tends to spend less. Nearly 19% of residents are 65 and older compared to 16.5% for the U.S., according to the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThe population has grown slowly but the state has surprisingly high home prices, Kamins says, discouraging people from moving in.\n\nVermont\n\n12-month inflation: 2.1%\n\nVermont has the nation’s third-oldest population behind Maine and New Hampshire. It was losing population for years but gained during the pandemic.\n\nThe state has a vibrant tourism industry but low snowfall hurt the past ski season and a historically wet summer last year discouraged visitors as well, Moody’s says.\n\nMeanwhile, a chip production factory, the state’s largest employer, has laid off workers because of weak global demand.\n\nConnecticut\n\n12-month inflation: 2.1%\n\nThe state drew New York City residents during the pandemic but many have now left for warmer, more affordable areas, Kamins says.\n\n“Housing affordability is a problem,” he says.\n\nContributing: C.A.

LOUIS — In a sometimes nasty second presidential debate, there were again several calls by the candidates for fact-checkers to referee competing statements, which we are happy to oblige. But even when Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton weren’t calling out each other on the facts, we found many of their uncontested claims to be misleading or false.\n\n• Clinton exaggerated when she said the U.S. was now “energy independent.” The country imported 11% of total energy consumed in 2015.\n\n• Trump falsely said he never tweeted “check out a sex tape” in the wee hours of the morning a few days after the first presidential debate. He did.\n\n• Trump told Clinton “after getting the subpoena” to turn over documents related to the Benghazi investigation “you delete 33,000 emails.” A contractor managing Clinton’s server deleted the emails. There is no evidence Clinton knew when they were deleted.\n\n• Trump also said Clinton’s emails were “acid washed,” calling it a “very expensive process.” Neither statement is true. The emails were deleted using a free software program that does not involve the use of chemicals.\n\n• Clinton said there is “no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using.” That is true, but the FBI said it was “possible” that her email system was hacked because she sent and received emails in “the territory of sophisticated adversaries.”\n\n• Clinton said intelligence officials said this week that Russians were behind political hacking attacks in the U.S. Trump said, “She doesn’t know if Russia is doing the hacking.” Clinton is closer to the truth.\n\n• Clinton claimed she was holding up Abraham Lincoln as an example of leadership when she defended “back room” deals. Turns out, she did.\n\n• Trump distorted the facts about a rape case that Clinton was involved in as a legal aid lawyer in 1975, wrongly accusing Clinton of “laughing at” the victim.\n\n• Both candidates distorted the other’s tax plan. Trump said Clinton was “raising everybody’s taxes massively,” when two analyses concluded almost all of the tax increases she proposes would fall on the top 10%. And Clinton claimed Trump’s plan “would end up raising taxes on middle class families.” Some families would see increased taxes, but on average middle-income taxpayers would get a tax cut.\n\n• Trump wrongly claimed that Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager said on TV that the campaign had started the false rumor that Obama was not born in the U.S.\n\n• Trump wrongly claimed that Clinton wanted to implement a government-run, “single-payer,” health care system, like Canada’s, and he cherry-picked high proposed premium increases in the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\n• Clinton went too far in saying an ACA provision to allow young adults to stay on their parents plans until age 26 was “something that didn’t happen before.” At least 31 states had similar provisions before the law was enacted.\n\n• Trump said that “Ambassador [Chris] Stevens sent 600 requests for help” before he was killed in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012. But not all 600 were requests for security upgrades, nor were they all from Stevens.\n\n• The candidates disagreed over Clinton’s role in a U.S. response to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Both had a point. Clinton was in office when President Obama said Assad’s use of chemical weapons would cross a “red line for us,” but she was gone when Obama failed to back up his threat.\n\n• Clinton claimed that since the Great Recession the gains have all gone to the top, but a 2016 economic report said that in 2014 and 2015 “the incomes of bottom 99% families have finally started recovering in earnest.”\n\n• Trump again claimed without evidence that “many people saw the bombs all over the apartment” of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nAnd there were more claims that we’ve heard before on trade, foreign affairs and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe second of three presidential debates was held on Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis. The much-anticipated town-hall-style matchup came as both candidates were facing renewed scrutiny: Trump for lewd comments about women made in 2005 but just released on Oct. 7, and Clinton for the public release of hacked emails from her campaign. As in the first debate, we found plenty of distortions of fact.\n\nThings got ugly — and then uglier: Top takeaways from Clinton-Trump II\n\nAnalysis: She called him a misogynist. He said she should go to jail.\n\nEnergy Independence\n\nClinton exaggerated when she said the U.S. was now “energy independent.”\n\nClinton: \"You know that we are now for the first time ever energy independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East, but the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. …We’ve got to remain energy independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\"\n\nActually, the U.S. imported 11% of the total energy it consumed in 2015, according to the most recent figures from the Energy Information Administration, and that percentage increased to 12% in the first six months of this year.\n\nWhile it’s correct to say that last year’s dependence on imported energy (from all sources, not just petroleum) was the lowest in a long time, it doesn’t represent total “independence,” and it’s not even the first time “ever” that the percentage has been so low. It was below 11% every single year from 1949 (the start of EIA’s figures) through 1971.\n\nJudging by her repeated mention of the “Middle East,” we suspect Clinton was thinking specifically of oil imports and not total energy. But looking only at petroleum, she’s even further off base to claim “independence.”\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. imported 24% of the petroleum and refined products that it consumed. To be sure, that was the lowest annual level of dependency on imports since 1970. However, dependency on imports has begun creeping upward once again. For the first eight months of 2016, imports have accounted for an average of 27.5% of consumption.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. is still importing a fair amount of oil from Persian Gulf states, despite what Clinton said about being “not dependent upon the Middle East.”\n\nThe total imports of petroleum and petroleum products from Persian Gulf states averaged 1.5 million barrels per day last year. That’s 45% less than the U.S. imported from them in 2001, when the total hit an annual high. But it’s still a long way from zero.\n\nTrump’s Sex Tape Tweet\n\nTrump said he never tweeted “check out a sex tape” in the wee hours of the morning a few days after the first presidential debate. That’s false — he did.\n\nDebate moderator Anderson Cooper asked Trump whether he had the “discipline” to be president, given the fact that he sent out “a series of tweets between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape” in the days after the first presidential debate.\n\nTrump responded, “No, there wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just take a look at the person [former Miss Universe Alicia Machado] that [Clinton] built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout, who was no Girl Scout.”\n\nBut Trump did say exactly that.\n\nOn Sept. 30 at 5:30 a.m., Trump tweeted, “Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?”\n\nAs for the supposed sex tape, Trump may be referring to a grainy, night-vision scene in a Spanish reality TV show in which Machado could be having sex under covers.\n\nClinton Emails\n\nThere were several claims about Clinton’s emails that were either wrong, misleading or lacked context.\n\nTrump twisted the facts when he directly addressed Clinton about her use of a private email system while secretary of state. “You get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails. And then you acid wash them — or bleach them, as you would say — a very expensive process,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is referring to 31,830 emails that Clinton’s lawyers had deemed personal and, as a result, did not have to be turned over to the government. As we have written, the department’s policy allows its employees to determine which emails are work-related and must be preserved. “Messages that are not records may be deleted when no longer needed,” according to the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual (5 FAM 443.5). So Clinton was entitled to delete those nearly 32,000 emails.\n\nIt is true that the emails were deleted after Clinton received a subpoena from a Republican-controlled House committee investigation into the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi. But there is no evidence that Clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued.\n\nA quick recap of what happened, according to FBI notes of its investigation: In December 2014, a Clinton attorney told Platte River Networks – which at the time was managing Clinton’s private server – that Clinton had preserved her work-related emails and “decided she no longer needed access to any of her e-mails older than 60 days.” Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s former chief of staff, instructed the PRN employee — who was not identified — “to modify the e-mail retention policy” on Clinton’s server “to reflect this change,” FBI notes show.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Clinton’s attorney informed PRN of the committee’s subpoena. The PRN employee who deleted the emails told the FBI that “he had an ‘oh shit’ moment” sometime between March 25 and March 31, 2015, and deleted the Clinton emails from the PRN server. Clinton told the FBI that she was not aware that they were deleted in late March 2015. (See pages 17-19 for the FBI’s notes on the deleted emails.) The FBI did not say when Clinton learned when the emails had been deleted.\n\nTrump went too far when he said “after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails” since there is no evidence at this time that shows she had knowledge of when the emails were deleted.\n\nAlso, Trump said the emails were “acid washed,” calling it a “very expensive process.” Neither statement is true. As we wrote, the FBI said that PRN used BleachBit, which is a free software program that does not involve the use of chemicals.\n\nAs for Clinton, she glossed over the facts when she said that there is “no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using.” That is true, but FBI Director James Comey said it was “possible” that her email system was hacked because she sent and received emails while in “the territory of sophisticated adversaries.”\n\nComey, July 5: \"With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence. We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account.\"\n\nHacking Attacks\n\nClinton claimed intelligence officials said this week that Russians were behind political hacking attacks, including of the Democratic National Committee. But Trump said, “She doesn’t know if Russia is doing the hacking.” Clinton is tilting closer toward the truth on this one.\n\nClinton: \"Our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days, that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.\" Trump: \"… I notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say, the Russians, the Russians — she doesn’t know it’s the Russians doing the hacking, maybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia.\"\n\nOn Oct. 7, the Department Of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security issued a joint statement saying they were “confident” that recent hacks into the email systems of the Democratic Party were directed by the Russian government.\n\nJoint Statement, Oct. 7: \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\"\n\nRussia has denied any involvement. But NBC News reported that U.S. intelligence officials were able to determine Russia’s involvement based on the “signature” of the attacks, which “hackers may not have realized they left behind.”\n\nTrump: If I win, I want special prosecutor looking into Clinton's 'situation'\n\nNastiest debate ever? Catch up on what you missed\n\nInvoking Lincoln\n\nClinton invoked Abraham Lincoln in defending a comment she made in a paid speech to apartment building landlords about politicians needing “a public position and a private position.”\n\nQ: \"[Y]ou say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So … is it okay for politicians to be two-faced?\" Clinton: \"[T]hat was something I said about Abraham Lincoln, and after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called 'Lincoln' [working to] get the Congress to approve the 13th amendment [which prohibits slavery]. It was principled and it was strategic. … That was a great I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\"\n\nThe question referred to a private email message — posted by Wikileaks — outlining some possibly troublesome passages from Clinton’s paid speeches, the transcripts of which she has not made public. It included this passage, supposedly from a transcript of a speech Clinton made to the National Multi-Family Council (a trade group for the apartment industry) on April 24, 2013 (emphasis added):\n\nClinton (as quoted by Wikileaks): \"You just have to sort of figure out how to — getting back to that word, 'balance' — how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful, politically, and that’s not just a comment about today. \"That, I think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if you saw the Spielberg movie, 'Lincoln,' and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward, who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going at it. \"I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\"\n\nSo we find Clinton was correct to this extent: If the Wikileaks quote is accurate — and Clinton did not dispute it — she was indeed holding the Great Emancipator up as an example to justify taking one position in public and another in “back room discussions.” But she also was conceding that she sometimes feels it politically necessary to be “two faced,” to use the phrase posed by the questioner.\n\nTrump to Clinton: You're no Lincoln\n\nClinton ‘Laughing’ at Rape Victim?\n\nWhile talking about Bill Clinton being “abusive to women,” Trump distorted the facts about a rape case that Hillary Clinton was involved in as a legal aid lawyer in 1975.\n\nTrump accused Hillary Clinton of “laughing at” a 12-year-old girl who was raped and claimed that Clinton “got [the accused rapist] off.” But Clinton did not laugh at the girl, and her client pleaded to a lesser offense.\n\nAlso, the rape case has nothing to do with Bill Clinton, although viewers may have been misled into thinking that it did because of how Trump discussed the case.\n\nTrump: \"Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them are here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years-old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight.\"\n\nAs we have written before, Clinton defended an accused rapist in 1975 when she worked at the University of Arkansas School Legal Aid Clinic. In her book Living History, Clinton recalled that Mahlon Gibson, a Washington County prosecutor, told her that the accused rapist “wanted a woman lawyer” to defend him, and that Gibson had recommended Clinton to Judge Maupin Cummings.\n\nIn a taped interview in 1980, Clinton recalled the rape case, and she can be heard laughing three times, beginning with a joke she makes about the accuracy of polygraphs. She said, “He took a lie detector test. I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.”\n\nAt another point, Clinton said the prosecutor balked at turning over evidence, forcing her to go to the judge to obtain it. “So I got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn’t want me to see the evidence. I had to go to Maupin Cummings and convince Maupin that yes indeed I had a right to see the evidence [Clinton laughs] before it was presented.”\n\nClinton did get the evidence, which turned out to be a pair of the accused’s underwear with a hole in it — which Clinton laughed about as she retold the story of taking the underwear to a forensic expert in New York. Clinton said that the expert told her that there wasn’t enough material on the underwear to test. In recalling the incident, Clinton said she told the judge that the forensic expert is “ready to come up from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice.” It was at this point that Clinton laughed.\n\nWe leave it for others to judge if her laughter was appropriate, but Clinton wasn’t laughing at the victim.\n\nClinton also didn’t “get him off.” The defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser offense and served one year in county jail and four years of probation.\n\nTrump's pre-debate Facebook Live features Bill Clinton accusers\n\nCompeting Tax Claims\n\nIn dueling tax claims, the candidates distorted the effects of each other’s tax plans.\n\nTrump said of Clinton’s plan, “She is raising everybody’s taxes massively.” Everybody? No. Analyses by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the pro-business Tax Foundation both concluded that almost all of the tax increases proposed by Clinton would fall on the top 10% of taxpayers. Hardest hit would be the less than 0.1% of taxpayers who earn more than $5 million per year. “Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes,” the Tax Policy Center concluded.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, claimed Trump’s plan, “would end up raising taxes on middle class families, millions of middle class families.” An analysis by New York University School of Law professor Lily L. Batchelder found that Trump’s plan “would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low- and middle-income families with children, with especially large tax increases for working single parents.” In all, the report estimated Trump’s plan would increase taxes for about 7.8 million families with children who are minors, or roughly 25 million individuals. But the Tax Foundation told us that while it was able to replicate those results, its full analysis of Trump’s plan found that, on average, middle income taxpayers would get a tax cut. “As our distributional tables show, the typical middle class family would get a net tax cut of several hundred dollars,” Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, told us. “Simply put, the middle class as a whole would see a tax reduction, but some middle class families would see a tax increase.”\n\nThe two also sparred over the so-called carried interest loophole. Trump, who proposes to close it, incorrectly said Clinton wants to keep it.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people,” Trump said. “But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary Clinton is leaving and it’s very interesting why she is leaving carried interest.”\n\nAccording to her tax plan, Clinton wants to close “the ‘carried interest’ loophole that allows hedge fund, private equity, and other Wall Street money managers to avoid paying ordinary income rates on their earnings.” Trump has also proposed this.\n\nClinton noted that she has been in favor of getting rid of this loophole since she was a senator from New York. While it is true that Clinton came out against carried interest during her tenure in the Senate, she was the last of the Democratic presidential candidates in 2007 to do so.\n\n‘Birther’ Repeats\n\nTrump again pushed the idea that Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign had started the false rumor that Obama was not born in the U.S. and was ineligible to be president. Trump wrongly claimed that Clinton’s campaign manager said “exactly that” on television recently.\n\nTrump: \"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal — he’s another real winner that you have — and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was saying exactly that.\"\n\nTrump is wrong about Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager. Solis Doyle has said that a “rogue volunteer coordinator” in Iowa was immediately fired when the campaign found out that the aide forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy.\n\nAnd Solis Doyle said that she did apologize to Obama campaign manager David Plouffe for the incident. “This was not the kind of campaign we wanted to run,” she said she told Plouffe.\n\nAs for Blumenthal, he has denied a claim made by McClatchy’s former bureau chief James Asher that Blumenthal, a senior adviser to Clinton’s 2008 campaign, encouraged McClatchy to chase the story of Obama’s birth.\n\nShashank Bengali, who now works at the Los Angeles Times, said Asher told him to “look into everything about Obama’s family in Kenya,” according to Politico. Asher gave Politico an email that he received from Bengali that said, “I can’t recall if we specifically discussed the birther claim, but I’m sure that was part of what I researched.”\n\nOther than that, there is no clear evidence to support Asher’s account.\n\nObamacare Claims\n\nTrump used an old GOP scare tactic, wrongly claiming that Clinton wanted to implement a government-run, “single-payer,” health care system, like Canada’s. He also cherry-picked high proposed premium increases in the exchanges, and he said that the law should be replaced with “something absolutely much less expensive,” when repealing the law is expected to increase federal deficits.\n\nWe’ll start with the single-payer claim.\n\nTrump: \"She wants to go to a single-payer plan … somewhat similar to Canada. … But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.\"\n\nClinton supports making Medicare available to those over age 55, and creating a “public option,” or a federal insurance plan, that would compete with private plans on the ACA exchanges. She hasn’t called for a single-payer system.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act was passed, Republicans repeatedly warned of a government takeover of health care. But the ACA didn’t do that — instead, it built upon, and expanded, private insurance as well as Medicaid.\n\nEarlier versions of the legislation contained a “public option,” or a federal insurance plan that would be offered, along with private insurance, on the ACA exchanges, where people who buy their own insurance can get coverage. Republicans claimed this public option would eventually lead to a Canadian- or British-style system of complete government-funded, universal health care. As we wrote at the time, the impact of the public option would depend on how it was structured. But one of the final versions of the House bill would have led to about 6 million Americans joining the public plan, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe public option wasn’t included in the final bill that President Obama signed into law.\n\nBut what had been proposed before still wasn’t anywhere near “single-payer,” a system in which everyone would have health coverage provided by the government.\n\nDuring the Democratic primary campaign, it was Sen. Bernie Sanders, not Clinton, who called for a single-payer system. Clinton criticized that idea, saying early this year, “I don’t believe number one we should be starting over. We had enough of a fight to get to the Affordable Care Act.”\n\nTrump also cherry-picked high proposed premium increases on the ACA exchanges, as he has done before, saying “your health insurance … is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68%, 59%, 71%.”\n\nIt’s true that some insurers have requested high rate increases for 2017 premiums on the exchanges. Any increase above 10% has to be submitted and approved by government regulators for the next open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. But other plans have proposed decreases.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed preliminary rates in cities in 16 states and Washington, D.C., and found the second-lowest cost silver plan would increase by a weighted average of 9% from this year if the rates hold. The change in premiums would vary widely — from a drop of 13% in Providence, R.I., to a hike of 25% in Nashville. That’s higher than the increase for 2016, which was only 2% for those areas.\n\nAlso, 80% of those buying exchange plans get federal subsidies, which lower premium contributions to a percentage of their income.\n\nAs for employer-based insurance plans, where most insured Americans get their coverage, those premiums have been rising at historical low rates for the past several years.\n\nFinally, Trump said that the ACA is “unbelievably expensive for our country. … We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive.” But the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation’s latest estimates on the impact of repealing the law find doing away with it would likely increase federal deficits over the 2016-2025 time period. While there is uncertainty in such estimates, CBO and JCT say, their “best estimate is that repealing the ACA would increase federal budget deficits by $137 billion over that 10-year period.”\n\nObamacare Boast\n\nClinton went too far in touting the benefits of the ACA, saying that a provision to allow young adults to stay on their parents plans until age 26 was “something that didn’t happen before.” In fact, at least 31 states already had similar provisions before the law was enacted.\n\nClinton: \"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. \"Number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before.\"\n\nAll of the provisions she rattled off were indeed part of the ACA. And it’s true that the law extended policies nationwide allowing young adults under age 26 to remain on their parents’ plans. That provision took effect in September 2010. But 31 states had similar measures in effect before then, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n“Before implementation of the ACA, at least 31 states required carriers to extend coverage to young adults,” the NCSL states. “The age at which insurers were no longer required to provide coverage to young adults under their guardians’ plans varied by state. Additionally, some states required certain conditions to be met by young adults in order to be eligible for coverage under their guardians’ plans. For example, a number of states required that young adults be unmarried in order to qualify.”\n\nSome states went beyond age 26. In New York and Pennsylvania, unmarried young adults could remain on their parents’ policies until age 30, and New Jersey extended that to age 31.\n\nClinton also said that insurance companies “can’t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.” To be clear, before the ACA, employer-provided plans could exclude coverage of the pre-existing condition temporarily, for up to a year. If a new employee had continuous coverage previously, with a gap in coverage no longer than 63 days, that employee was granted a waiver for that exclusion period, equal to the time spent on the previous plan.\n\n‘600 Requests for Help’?\n\nTrump said that “Ambassador [Chris] Stevens sent 600 requests for help” before he was killed in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012. But as the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, not all 600 came from Stevens, nor were they all requests for security upgrades, as it may have appeared to those watching or listening to the debate.\n\nThe total refers to the “cumulative number of security requests/concerns from Benghazi – 2012,” according to a chart the House Select Committee on Benghazi showed during a congressional hearing in October 2015. And “requests” and “concerns” are not the same thing, the Fact Checker said.\n\nFrom its report:\n\nWashington Post Fact Checker, Jan. 26: \" 'A request is made via email or cable for physical security, equipment, or something related to the compound itself (lighting, barriers, wire, etc),' a GOP congressional staff member explained. 'Weeks or months later, the same unresolved issue is brought up again in a discussion. That’s a request and a concern. In general, concerns followed requests. However, some concerns are independent of a request. Such concerns could, for example, be expressed about the delay of issuing visas to DS agents kept out of Libya. Concerns could be expressed about security personnel needing to provide their own holsters or protective gear, etc.' \"Requests, meanwhile, were about any specific security-related need in Benghazi. A request for hundreds of sandbags would count as one request.\"\n\nHowever, officials could not say how many of the 600 were security requests and how many were concerns.\n\nAlso, the State Department Accountability Review Board, which did call U.S. security in Benghazi “inadequate” prior to the attack, noted in its report that the agency made several security upgrades in 2012. So at least some of the security issues raised by officials were addressed, which may not have been clear from Trump’s statement.\n\nThe Red Line\n\nTrump and Clinton had a disagreement over President Obama’s failure to back up his threat to use military force if Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his own people.\n\nTrump said Clinton “was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand,” referring to Obama’s threat that Assad’s use of chemical weapons would cross “a red line for us.” Obama made that remark in August 2012 in response to a question about whether he “envision[ed] using U.S. military” in Syria.\n\nClinton interrupted Trump and claimed that she was not in office.\n\nTrump: \"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which …\" Clinton: \"No, I wasn’t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point …\" Trump: \"OK. But you were in contact — excuse me. You were …\" Clinton: \"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\" Trump: \"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don’t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\"\n\nIt’s not really clear if Trump was criticizing Obama for making the threat or not following through on it, because Clinton interrupted him. But the fact is, Clinton was in office when Obama made his threat in August 2012, but not when the president defended his failure to back it up in September 2013. Clinton was secretary of state from January 2009 to February 2013.\n\nObama has been criticized for not following through on his threat, so perhaps Clinton quickly interrupted Trump to distance herself from Obama’s decision not to take action. However, she did publicly support that decision even though she was no longer in office.\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2013, Clinton said a “political solution” is in the best interests of the U.S. “I will continue to support his efforts and I hope that the Congress will as well,” she said.\n\nTrump, angrily, to Clinton: 'No I'm a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead'\n\nTrump-Clinton debate stays angry until the very end\n\nIncome Exaggeration\n\nClinton repeated a campaign talking point that overstates income inequality.\n\nClinton: \"It’s been unfortunate, but it’s happened, that since the Great Recession the gains have all gone to the top and we need to reverse that.\"\n\n“All” of the income gains since the Great Recession haven’t gone to the top.\n\nClinton usually says that 90% of the income gains have gone to the top 1%. And that was the case, at least according to the work of economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, based on preliminary 2013 data. But that talking point is now outdated.\n\nSaez’s most recent figures show that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the income growth from 2009 to 2015. That’s also the case for 1993-2015.\n\nHe wrote in his June 30, 2016, report: “In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99% families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession. By 2015, real incomes of bottom 99% have now recovered about two thirds of the losses experienced during the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009. Top 1% families still capture 52% of total real income growth per family from 2009-2015 (Table 1) but the recovery from the Great Recession now looks much less lopsided than in previous years.”\n\nReporting Terrorists\n\nIn stressing that Muslims need to notify the police of wrongdoing in their communities, Trump claimed without evidence that “many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people” in San Bernardino last year.\n\nAs we have written, a neighbor reportedly had noticed packages being delivered to the San Bernardino home of the shooters, and told a friend that the couple was doing a lot of work in their garage. The friend said the neighbor did not want to racially profile the couple, so she did not report it. Another worker in the neighborhood reported seeing well-dressed Middle Eastern men walking from the house to lunch several times, which the worker said he thought was unusual but also did not report.\n\nBut in neither case did anyone report that they had seen “bombs all over the floor” of the couple’s home, and failed to report it to authorities.\n\nTrump made the same claim about the San Bernardino case after a mass shooting in June at a gay night club in Orlando. At that time, Trump said “Muslims are the ones that have to report him,” referring to the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen. However, Mohammed A. Malik contacted the FBI in 2014 after he learned that Mateen had been watching videotapes of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Yemen-based imam. The FBI confirmed Malik’s story, the Washington Post wrote.\n\n2016 Poll Tracker - USA TODAY\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network\n\nStill More Repeats\n\nAnd it was Groundhog Day for fact-checkers on several other topics:\n\nNuclear weapons: Clinton exaggerated when she said she was responsible for getting “a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.” The New START agreement, which Clinton helped negotiate, caps the number of nuclear weapons that Russia and the U.S. can deploy on long-range (or strategic) launchers at 1,550. But, as we wrote, it does not require either side to destroy any nuclear weapons or reduce their nuclear stockpile, and it doesn’t place limits on shorter-range nuclear weapons. Also, Russia was below the limit for deployed strategic nuclear warheads when the treaty took effect in 2011, and it has increased them since then. As of Sept. 1, Russia had 1,796 deployed strategic nuclear warheads — up from 1,537 deployed warheads in February 2011, according to the Department of State.\n\nLibya, Iraq and ISIS: Trump once again criticized Clinton for “bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why ISIS formed in the first place.” Trump conveniently leaves out that he posted a YouTube video in February 2011 voicing support for U.S. intervention in Libya to remove Moammar Gadhafi from power, and that he told CNN in a 2007 interview that the U.S. should “declare victory [in Iraq] and leave … [T]his is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now, because you just are wasting time.” And finally Trump pins too much blame for the rise in ISIS — whose origin dates back to the Bush administration — on the troop withdrawal (an issue we explored in length in our story, “Trump’s False Obama-ISIS Link.”)\n\nLibyan oil: It’s been half a year, and Trump is still making the false claim that “ISIS has a good chunk” of Libyan oil fields. We first flagged this statement in April, when an expert on Libya’s oil operations told us there’s no evidence that the Islamic State has control of any oil fields in that country.\n\nTrade deficit: As he did during the first presidential debate, Trump wrongly claimed that last year the U.S. had “an almost $800 billion trade deficit.” Trump is referring to the trade deficit for goods, which was $762.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But the U.S. had a $262.2 billion trade surplus in services, including intellectual property such as software, for a net trade deficit in goods and services of $500.4 billion last year.\n\nNAFTA: Trump said that the North American Free Trade Agreement was “signed by her husband,” referring to President Bill Clinton. As we have written, NAFTA was negotiated and signed by President George H.W. Bush. Clinton signed the implementing legislation. Trump also said the trade agreement had “stripped us” of manufacturing jobs. A 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service called the net impact “relatively modest,” saying “NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.”\n\nIraq War: Trump repeated that he “was against the war in Iraq” and claimed that this “has not been debunked.” But we have found no evidence that he was against the Iraq War before it began. At the first debate, Trump cited as evidence “numerous conversations” that he privately had with Sean Hannity of Fox News. He also has cited a January 2003 TV interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. In the TV interview, Trump told Cavuto that President Bush needed to make a decision on Iraq. “Either you attack or you don’t attack,” he says. But he offered no opinion on what Bush should do. There is simply no public record of Trump opposing the war before it started.\n\nClinton on coal: Trump claimed that “Clinton wants to put all the [coal] miners out of business.” At a CNN town hall forum in March, Clinton said she wants to “move away from coal,” and that in the shift to renewable energy production “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” But she added, “We don’t want to forget those people.” And she promised to bring renewable energy jobs to coal country to replace lost coal jobs. Clinton reiterated that position in the debate, saying she “supports moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can. … But I also want to be sure we do not leave people behind. That is why I am the only candidate, from the very beginning of this campaign, who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country.”\n\nNote to Readers: FactCheck.org Deputy Managing Editor Robert Farley was at the debate at Washington University.

Record-breaking heatwaves. Droughts that bring ruin to farmers. Raging forest fires. The mass die-off of the world's coral reefs. Food scarcity.\n\nTo avoid a climate change apocalypse, carbon dioxide emissions need to fall by as much as 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nInstead, utilities and energy companies are continuing to invest heavily in carbon-polluting natural gas. An exclusive analysis by USA TODAY finds that across the United States there are as many as 177 natural gas power plants currently planned, under construction or announced. There are close to 2,000 now in service.\n\nAll that natural gas is “a ticking time bomb for our planet,” says Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club. “If we are to prevent runaway climate change, these new plants can’t be built.\"\n\nIt also doesn't make financial sense, according to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank that focuses on energy and resource efficiency. By the time most of these power plants are slated to open their doors, the electricity they’ll provide will cost more to produce than clean energy alternatives.\n\nBy 2023, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates the average cost of producing a megawatt hour of electricity will be $40.20 for a large-scale natural gas plants. Solar installations will be $2.60 cheaper and wind turbines will be $3.60 cheaper.\n\nCatastrophic effects ahead unless we make changes\n\nThe world needs to reduce its carbon emissions rapidly – by 50% within the next decade – or face the prospect of a global temperature rise of more than 2.7 degrees within decades, said Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nThat’s enough warming to kill off the coral reefs, melt large parts of the ice sheets, inundate coastal cities and to yield what Mann calls “nearly perpetual extreme weather events.”\n\n“By any definition, that would be catastrophic,” he said.\n\nWe’re seeing the start of it now. There’s strong data to suggest that global warming is already causing changes in the jet stream and other weather systems. That can cause hurricanes to slow down and wreak devastation in single areas for longer, said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia.\n\n“With Dorian, we saw it stall over the Bahamas. We saw that with Harvey in Houston and Florence in the Carolinas,” he said.\n\nMore gas = more carbon dioxide\n\nAdding dozens of new natural gas plants in the coming decades is going in the exact opposite direction of what we need, clean energy advocates say.\n\n“If the current pipeline of gas plants were to get built, it would make decarbonizing the power sector by 2050 nearly impossible,” said Joe Daniel, a senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAn analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute published Monday looked at 88 gas-fired power plants scheduled to begin operation by 2025. They would emit 100 million tons of carbon dioxide a year – equivalent to 5% of current annual emissions from the U.S. power sector.\n\nThe institute calculated the cost of producing a megawatt-hour of electricity of a clean energy portfolio in each state that would provide the same level of power reliability as a gas plant. It determined that building clean energy alternatives would cost less than 90% of the proposed 88 plants.\n\nIt would also save customers over $29 billion in their utility bills, said Mark Dyson, an electricity markets analyst who co-authored the Rocky Mountain Institute paper.\n\n“If you look at how things pencil out, we’re at a tipping point,” he said. \"Here's evidence that the switch from gas to clean energy makes economic sense and is compatible with utility companies' need for reliability.\"\n\nMore power plants coming to a state near you\n\nUSA TODAY compiled its own list of 177 planned and proposed natural gas plants through August, using data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which tracks power plants that have been officially announced, and the Sierra Club, which tracks proposed plants.\n\nOf those, 152 have a scheduled opening date of between 2019 and 2033, though only 130 have specific locations chosen. An additional 25 are part of companies’ long-term planning processes and don’t have estimated opening dates yet.\n\nThe plants are a mix of large-scale installations meant to provide lots of electricity much of the day and smaller plants used for short periods when demand for energy is particularly high.\n\nTexas has the most proposed plants, with 26. Next is Pennsylvania with 24, North Carolina with 12, Florida with 10, California with nine and Montana with eight.\n\nNot all will be built. Power companies are required to estimate future needs and plan as much as 15 years out, and this list includes plants which the companies may eventually decide they don’t need.\n\nBut the numbers show that greenhouse gas-producing natural gas is still on the table for many power producers, despite warnings that the energy sector needs to be quickly moving away from carbon-producing power sources.\n\nAnother concern raised by clean energy advocates is that once built, natural gas plants typically have a 30-year lifespan. Many of these plants will end up as \"stranded assets,\" unused because they're too expensive to run, while consumers will still be on the hook for the cost of the construction, said Daniel.\n\nIt’s also true that power companies are building out solar and wind generation. Over the next two years, clean energy is expected to be the fastest-growing source of U.S. electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nEven so, that will only bring the share of wind and solar in the United States electricity market to slightly under 11%.\n\nBy 2020, EIA expects natural gas will make up about 36% of U.S. electricity generation. In comparison, coal is at 23%, nuclear at 20% and hydroelectric at 7%.\n\nWhy are we still building natural gas plants?\n\nIf natural gas plants contribute to global warming and most of them are going to be more expensive, why are so many still on the drawing board? The reasons are varied.\n\nEnergy companies say gas is more reliable than renewables and cheaper and less carbon polluting than the coal it often replaces.\n\nBut renewable energy advocates say the incentives for utilities and energy producers aren’t always in line with those of consumers.\n\nFor regulated utilities, one of the easiest ways to make money is to invest capital in large building projects, such as natural gas plants. Regulators allow utilities to set rates so that they get a return on invested capital of about 10%, Dyson said. That gives energy companies an incentive to build as much as possible.\n\nIn contrast, utilities that procure wind and solar power via commonly available purchase contracts earn no returns for these projects.\n\n\"There's a perverse incentive for some utilities to build as big as they can, rather than to build as smart as they can,\" said Ben Inskeep, an analyst with EQ Research, a clean energy policy consulting firm in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nCompanies also focus on reliability. Duke Energy, a power company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has more than 7 million customers. As it transitions away from coal, it has embraced natural gas, announcing last week that it was considering as many as five new gas plants.\n\nToday 5% of Duke Energy Carolinas' electricity comes from solar, a percentage it plans to increase to between 8% and 13% by 2034, according to its most recent filing with state regulators. The state has almost no wind energy because of laws restricting the placement of wind turbines.\n\n\"We know our customers and communities want cleaner energy, and we’re doing our part to deliver that,\" said spokeswoman Erin Culbert.\n\nBut she emphasized that Duke doesn't believe solar and wind can be cost-effective and reliable enough to meet all its customers' energy needs.\n\n“Continued use of natural gas is key to our ability to speed up coal retirements, and its flexibility helps complement and balance the growing renewables on our system,” she said.\n\nGovernment regulators favor gas\n\nAnother hurdle for renewable energy, some supporters say, is a combination of state-level rate-setting requirements and regional market rules that have led to a compensation structure for companies that favors coal and natural gas.\n\nWho sets those rules depends on where the plant is.\n\nIn states where retail utilities own their own power generation facilities, the rates are approved by public utility commissions. Commissioners are typically appointed by state governors.\n\nThe process is less clear in the Midwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, California, and Texas, where utilities buy and sell their power through organized markets run by regional transmission organizations.\n\nThese are run by boards that by law must be independent. They are typically composed of people from the business and energy world and are chosen by complex systems. In some cases they are voted on by existing board members.\n\nThe boards set the rules, which are then approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nUltimately these commissions and boards are supposed to decide what’s cost-effective for both the companies and ratepayers, said Scott Hempling, an adviser to regulators, law professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and author of two books on public utility law and regulation.\n\n“A utility’s preference for profit is neither surprising nor wrong. But it’s not the utility’s job to balance its self-interest against the customers’ interest. It’s the job of regulators to constrain the private profit impulse with public interest principles,” he said.\n\nIt’s not news that there is bias towards profit, which can disadvantage customers. “The question is why it’s allowed to persist,\" he said.\n\nThere are signs that what clean energy advocates have called an automatic rubber stamp for natural gas is beginning to change.\n\nIn April, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission denied a permit for a southern Indiana utility named Vectren South to build a $780 million natural gas plant. The regulators weren’t convinced the utility had chosen the best option to ensure its customers weren’t in danger of being “saddled with an uneconomic investment” in the future, it said.\n\nIn Michigan last year, local utility DTE won a bruising battle to build a 1,100 megawatt natural gas plant that will open in 2022 and cost nearly $1 billion. Critics complained the projections DTE used to make its case to regulators made wind and solar look less attractive.\n\nThe three members of the Michigan Public Service Commission, who are appointed by the governor, ended up approving the project. But the board's 136-page opinion was not complimentary toward the utility, noting it was “concerned” about the constraints DTE built into the models it used to estimate whether renewable energy would be a viable alternative.\n\nSome utilities choose clean energy\n\nNot every utility company is ignoring warnings about the planet's health, or customers’ pocketbooks.\n\nMichigan utility Consumers Energy decided last year not to build new natural gas plants and instead focus on a combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy and batteries, which it says will be cheaper for customers.\n\nThe company, which has more than 4 million customers, plans to use 90% clean energy by 2040, said Brandon Hofmeister, senior vice president for governmental, regulatory and public affairs.\n\nWhen the utility was putting together its existing energy plan, it took a new approach, balancing the cost to consumers and to the Earth.\n\n“Honestly, there was some pushback. There were several pretty tense meetings,” Hofmeister said. \"You’d hear someone ask in a meeting, ‘Is that really the right thing to do for Michigan and the planet?’”\n\nA similar story played out in Indiana, one of the nation’s top 10 coal-producing states. A few years ago, Northern Indiana Public Service Company, based in Merrillville, Indiana, was getting ready to retire its old, expensive coal-fired power plants. An analysis in 2016 said they should be replaced with natural gas plants.\n\nTo be on the safe side, Joe Hamrock, president and CEO, checked again last year.\n\n“We knew this is moving pretty fast and we needed to take a new look. A 30-year bet on a gas plant is a long time,” he said.\n\nWhen his team sat down to look at the 90 project proposals that had come in, the answer came as a shock – natural gas wasn’t even in the picture anymore.\n\n“The surprise was how dramatically the renewables and storage proposals beat natural gas,” Hamrock said. “I couldn’t have predicted this five years ago.”\n\nThe company is now set to retire all its coal-fired power plants, which produce 65% of its electricity today, and replace them all with renewables. In nine years, it expects to get 65% of its electricity from renewables and 25% from natural gas.\n\nWhat will U.S. energy look like in the future?\n\nElectricity generators counter that it’s impossible to get entirely away from natural gas because solar and wind are intermittent. When it comes time to turn on the lights, consumers can’t wait for the sun to come up or the wind to blow.\n\n“We believe that natural gas has a role in a clean future because we believe it will be needed to balance out renewables,” said Emily Fisher, general counsel for the Edison Electric Institute in Washington, D.C. EEI is the trade association that represents investor-owned electric utilities in the United States.\n\n“But we’ve also got to make sure the power supply stays affordable and reliable,” she said.\n\nElectricity generators have a point, say energy analysts who aren’t necessarily in the pro-renewable camp. But those same analysts suggest a lot less natural gas is needed than we're using today.\n\n“The cheapest way to reduce carbon is to replace coal with a combination of renewables and as little natural gas as you can get by with to keep the lights on,” said Arne Olson, a senior partner with Energy and Environmental Economics, a San Francisco-based energy consulting firm that works with multiple states to craft energy plans.\n\nThat makes getting to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change – cutting greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025 – not quite so daunting. The United States initially pledged to join the agreement but President Donald Trump said in 2017 that the nation would not uphold the deal.\n\nIn fact, the electric industry is already undergoing a major restructuring. Largely because of the rapid rise of cheap natural gas, coal went from producing almost 45% of U.S. electricity in 2010 to a predicted 23% next year, according to EIA data.\n\nThe energy sector has shown it can move quickly when the prices are right, said Dyson of the Rocky Mountain Institute. And, he said, it's imperative that a similar shift happen now with natural gas – and fast.\n\n“Constructing these gas plants is incompatible with a low carbon future,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/09"}]}

Strong trade winds are blowing the ash away from the island’s major population centers and scientists say there’s little danger to the public from the latest eruption.\n\nAuthorities say the ash is powdered rock and poses no significant health threat as of 1 p.m. local time. Poisonous gases that do pose a threat are also being blown away from the island’s biggest city, Hilo. The eruption began early Tuesday morning and continued through the day.\n\n“We are observing more or less continuous emissions of ash,” Steve Brantley of the federal Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.\n\nAuthorities have been warning of an eruption like this for days as lava has been oozing out of the volcano and destroying homes in the nearby Pahoa area. Scientists say the ash plume is likely caused by debris falling into the largely empty Halemaumau Crater and exploding. The plume is rising more than two miles above the ground, according to pilots and radar, authorities said.\n\n\"At any time, activity may become more explosive, increasing the intensity of ash production and producing ballistic projectiles near the vent,\" the HVO said in a statement.\n\nKīlauea, not considered an explosive volcano like Mount St. Helens or Pompeii, has been erupting nearly continuously since 1983 but not always at the level of recent weeks. A significant eruptive episode that began on May 3 sent lava pouring through a rural neighborhood about 35 miles from Hilo.

At least three major blasts followed Tuesday, including an explosion at nightfall that was capped by one of the most massive lava displays since the volcano started acting up more than a week ago, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.\n\n“We couldn’t sleep last night because of the loud rumblings. It sounded like an airplane that’s about to land,” Quintin Velardo, a 59-year-old farmer, told The Associated Press at an evacuation center in Legazpi city where he took his wife, children and grandchildren on Tuesday.\n\nDespite the danger, he said he needed to return to his village, about 5 miles from the erupting volcano, to take his cow and water buffalo to safety. A few minutes later, the volcano belched a massive column of grayish ash that punched through white clouds into the blue sky.\n\n“There it goes again,” Velardo said, his family huddled near him.\n\nAuthorities warned a violent eruption may occur in hours or days, characterized by more rumblings and pyroclastic flows – superheated gas and volcanic debris that race down the slopes at high speeds, vaporizing everything in their path.\n\nAfter Monday’s explosion, officials raised Mayon’s alert level to four on a scale of five, and the danger zone was expanded to 5 miles from the crater, requiring thousands more residents to be evacuated, including at least 12,000 who returned to their homes last week as Mayon’s rumblings temporarily eased and then scrambled back to the emergency shelters this week.\n\nAt least 56,217 people were taking shelter in 46 evacuation camps Tuesday and army troops and police were helping move more villagers from their homes, officials said.\n\nAuthorities struggled to prevent villagers from sneaking back to check on their homes and farms and to watch a popular cockfight in Albay’s Santo Domingo town despite the risks and police patrols and checkpoints, said Cedric Daep, a provincial disaster response official.\n\nIn a sign of desperation, Daep told a news conference that he has recommended electricity and water supplies be cut in communities within the no-go zones to discourage residents from returning.\n\n“If pyroclastic flows hit people, there is no chance for life,” Daep said. “Let us not violate the natural law, avoid the prohibited zone, because if you violate, the punishment is the death penalty.”\n\nThe daytime eruptions have plunged nearby villages into darkness and sent lava, rocks and debris cascading down Mayon’s slopes toward the no-entry danger zone. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries. Airplanes have been ordered to stay away from the crater and ash-laden winds, and several domestic flights have been canceled.\n\nVolcanic ash fell Monday in more than a dozen towns in coconut-growing Albay and nearby Camarines Sur province, with visibility heavily obscured in a few towns because of the thick gray ash, Jukes Nunez, another Albay provincial disaster response officer, said by telephone.\n\n“It was like night time at noon, there was zero visibility in some areas because the ash fall was so thick,” Nunez said.\n\nMore than 30,000 ash masks and about 5,000 sacks of rice, along with medicine, water and other supplies, were being sent to evacuation centers, Office of Civil Defense regional director Claudio Yucot said late Monday.\n\nFood packs, water, medicine and other relief goods remain adequate but may run out by mid-February if the eruption continues and new supplies fail to come on time, officials said.\n\nWith its near-perfect cone, Mayon has long been popular with climbers and tourists but has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently. The 8,070-foot volcano has generated tourism revenues and jobs in Albay, about 210 miles southeast of Manila.\n\nIn 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings. Its most destructive eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and buried the town of Cagsawa in volcanic mud. The belfry of Cagsawa’s stone church still juts from the ground in an eerie reminder of Mayon’s fury.\n\nSince childhood, Velardo, the farmer, said he has gambled his and his family’s lives in Mayon’s shadow but that he and thousands of other landless farmers have no place else to go. “I tell my grandchildren to study hard so they can live elsewhere without a volcano to keep an eye on all your life.”\n\nThe Philippines, which has about 22 active volcanoes, lies in the “Ring of Fire,” a line of seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.\n\nIn 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing about 800 people, covering entire towns and cities in ash and partly prompting the U.S. government to abandon its vast air and naval bases on the main northern Luzon island.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/04/22/calbuco-volcano-chile/26216651/", "title": "Incredible images from volcano erupting in Chile", "text": "Luis Andres Henao\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Twin blasts from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have sent vast clouds of ash into the sky, increasing concerns that it could contaminate water, cause respiratory illnesses and ground more flights.\n\nThe volcano erupted Wednesday afternoon for the first time in more than four decades, sending a towering plume of ash more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) into the air. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert.\n\nCalbuco had another spectacular outburst early Thursday lightning crackling through a dark sky lit orangish red by the explosion.\n\nAs the ash cloud spread, \"people went into a state of panic,\" said Miguel Silva Diaz, 28, an engineer who lives in Puerto Montt, a city about 14 miles from the volcano.\n\n\"Then, at around 1 a.m., I heard a loud noise, as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.\"\n\nNo injuries were reported and the only missing person since the eruption was found on Thursday. Authorities evacuated 4,000 people as gas and ash continued to spew, and they closed access to the area around the volcano, which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt, some 620 miles south of Santiago.\n\n\"I was shocked. I had just arrived home when I looked through the window and saw the column of smoke rising up. We called our families, posted photos,\" said Daniel Palma, 30, a psychologist who lives in Puerto Varas.\n\n\"We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us,\" Palma said, adding that many are concerned about the possible effects of the ash on their health.\n\nPresident Michelle Bachelet declared a state of emergency, saying the eruption of Calbuco is \"more serious and unpredictable\" than the one last month at the Villarica volcano, which also forced the evacuation of thousands.\n\nAsh continued to fall Thursday in Puerto Montt and other nearby cities, said 30-year-old Patricio Vera, the director of a local radio station. Varas said that after the eruption, hundreds of people rushed to get gas, forcing stations to ration sales, while supermarkets closed early to avoid the risk of looting.\n\nThe 6,500 foot Calbuco last erupted in 1972 and is considered one of the top three most potentially dangerous among Chile's 90 active volcanos.\n\nLATAM airlines cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines.\n\nIn 2011, a volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew ash, and the thick abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche, over the border in Argentina.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business.\n\n\"We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,\" said mayor Roberto Cacault.\n\nVideo journalist Gonzalo Keogan in Villa La Angostura, Argentina, and Eva Vergara in Santiago contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/world/underwater-volcano-hunters-hunga-tonga-hunga-haapai-scn-hnk-spc-intl", "title": "Tonga volcano: How 'seafloor detectives' uncovered its secrets | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in Tonga in January 2022, it became the largest eruption ever recorded with modern technology.\n\nThe blast, estimated to be hundreds of times stronger than the Hiroshima nuclear explosion, was heard in Alaska, more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) away. A plume of ash, smoke and volcanic matter shot 58 kilometers (36 miles) into the air, and hurricane-speed winds were reported in Earth’s uppermost atmospheric layer at the edge of space.\n\nAnd then came the waves: tsunami warnings were issued in nearby Pacific Island nations Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu, as well as farther away in New Zealand, Japan, Peru, the US and Canada. The ensuing tsunami devastated Tonga with waves up to 15 meters high, killing three people and causing an estimated $90.4 million worth of damage.\n\nNow, a team of researchers has completed the fullest investigation to date into the event, confirming that almost 10 square kilometers of seafloor was displaced – equivalent to 2.6 million Olympic pools, and a third more than initial estimates.\n\nHowever, they found that only three quarters of this material was deposited in an area within 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) of the volcano, leaving a sizable chunk unaccounted for. New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), which conducted the research, believes this missing debris could be partly explained by “aerial loss,” which is why it wasn’t noticed until detailed mapping work was completed. The material was shot into the sky and remained in the atmosphere, circulating for months, explaining why it wasn’t on the seafloor.\n\nBut it remains unclear to researchers exactly why the eruption was so explosive.\n\nSome answers came from an earlier expedition also conducted by NIWA, which mapped the sea floor around Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai.\n\nNIWA's research vessel set sail in April 2022 to uncover why the volcano erupted so violently. Here, it is flanked by the islands -- which used to be one -- that remain after the explosion: Hunga Ha'apai (left) and Hunga Tonga. NIWA-Nippon Foundation TESMaP / Rebekah Parsons-King\n\nSeafloor explorer\n\nErica Spain is a marine geology technician at NIWA and a member of the expedition that set out in April. Describing herself as a “seafloor detective,” Spain uses high-tech echolocation machinery to hunt for underwater volcanoes, and pieces together clues about the “triggers” that influence underwater eruptions.\n\nOn board the RV Tangaroa, NIWA’s research vessel equipped with state-of-the-art underwater surveillance technology, Spain had a dual role: operating the multibeam and taking samples of mud and rock sediment from the seafloor.\n\nThe multibeam echosounder “sends out acoustic pulses to map the seafloor in 3D,” says Spain, likening it to the echolocation a dolphin uses. “We have hydrophones that receive that echo, and from that, we can determine how deep the sea floor is, and build up an idea of its shape and geometry.”\n\nWith a volcanic cone just 100 meters (328 feet) tall on a small island in the Pacific, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai wasn’t much to look at before the eruption. Beneath the surface though, the volcano stretched over 20 kilometers wide and nearly 2 kilometers deep.\n\nMaxar/Getty Images Maxar/Getty Images Satellite images show Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai before and after the eruption.\n\nContinued instability in the caldera meant the crew couldn’t examine the volcano’s opening — so an uncrewed surface vessel was deployed instead. Operated remotely by a SeaKit, based in the UK 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles) from Tonga, the 12-meter-long (40-foot) robot discovered that the caldera had collapsed, now lying 700 meters (2,300 feet) below the surface.\n\nIn total, 22,000 square kilometers of the seafloor were scanned. Parts of the seafloor around Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai had already been mapped out, and by comparing the maps of the seafloor before and after the eruption, “we can begin to build up a better image of what these triggers might be,” Spain says.\n\nExplosive findings\n\nThe results of the expedition surprised the team, says Spain. They had expected that the huge eruption would have left a lot of volcanic debris on the seafloor, but in fact, “the volcano looked very similar to what it looked like decades prior,” says Spain.\n\nInstead of coming to rest in the ocean, “a large proportion of that (volcanic material) just went straight up into the stratosphere,” says Spain.\n\nOn board the RV Tangaroa, marine geology technician Erica Spain (pictured) had two roles: mapping the seafloor with a multibeam echosounder, and taking sediment samples (pictured). NIWA-Nippon Foundation TESMaP / Rebekah Parsons-King\n\nThe discrepancy between the size of the caldera collapse and the seafloor debris pointed toward another factor in the explosion: hot magma from the volcano had interacted with the cool seawater to create steam. “Steam takes up a thousand times as much volume as water,” says Spain. “It explains in some regard why it was so eruptive.”\n\nThe results from the data gathered before, during, and after the eruption pointed towards “multiple mechanisms” happening simultaneously, says Emily Lane, a hydrodynamic scientist at NIWA and member of New Zealand’s Tsunami Experts Panel.\n\nThe initial eruption blew water out of the way, causing localized waves. But changes in air pressure reinforced those waves creating a meteotsunami that travels faster than the speed of sound — and in the case of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai, “it generated a pressure wave that traveled around the world three or four times,” says Lane.\n\nTongatapu is Tonga's largest and most populous island. Vakaloa Beach Resort (pictured) on the island's north-west coast was battered by tsunami waves, like many other parts of the island. NIWA / Rebekah Parsons-King\n\nWaves were also created by volcanic debris raining down into the water, and the caldera collapse, says Lane.\n\nNIWA already has a tsunami warning system in place, with sensors on the seafloor around New Zealand and the South Pacific to monitor sea levels, tides and currents, and to report anomalies. And now, the data gathered from Tonga can help refine these sensors, says Lane.\n\n“This event has really changed our understanding of volcanic tsunamis because this is the first time that we’ve actually been able to get modern instrumentational measurements of what happened,” says Lane.\n\nScientists on the RV Tangaroa used a remote underwater glider to gather data from the water column surrounding the underwater volcano. NIWA-Nippon Foundation TESMaP / Rebekah Parsons-King\n\nAnd while the map of the seafloor gave researchers a better understanding about the eruption at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai, it also contributed to a larger project: Seabed 2030, a global initiative run by the Nippon Foundation, which aims to map the entire sea floor.\n\nThis map of the seafloor can help identify important or vulnerable ecosystems, says Spain. The information gathered can also help aid the recovery of the surrounding ocean and marine environment. For somewhere like Tonga, where around 82% of the population engages in subsistence fishing, understanding the impact of eruptions on aquatic life is vital.\n\n“We don’t know enough about the ocean and our impacts on it, so mapping it, observing it, and understanding it is incredibly important,” says Spain.", "authors": ["Rebecca Cairns Hazel Pfeifer", "Rebecca Cairns", "Hazel Pfeifer"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/09/06/mysterious-iceland-challenges-visitors/71477288/", "title": "Mysterious Iceland challenges visitors", "text": "Bob Hill\n\nLet me say at the beginning that six weeks spent walking the Big Four Bridge did not qualify as particularly useful training for hiking the glacier-carved, volcano-pitted, rock-strewn upland trails of Iceland.\n\nSix months may not have done it.\n\nThe sponsoring Road Scholar brochure on Iceland did supply ample warning: “Activity level Challenging: Get ready to keep up with our highest-energy group. These demanding – and rewarding – programs are for seasoned outdoor enthusiasts.”\n\nSomewhat missing in all that is the compelling history and imposing physical poetry of the place. In geological terms Iceland is a child; it’s been only 20 million years since the volcanoes that created it began pushing up lava from the North Atlantic floor.\n\nThe country is now and forever an earthquake or volcano waiting to happen; two massive tectonic plates beneath its surface are slowly pulling apart. The movement produces tiny tremors almost daily and gives the melted rock just below ample opportunities to spew forth in black ash and angry, red fury.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRoad Scholar exists to give people primarily in their 50s to 70s a chance to visit such natural wonder. Our walking and hiking journey across Iceland’s southern edge took us deep into that rift in the earth, past temporarily dormant volcanic mountains, bubbling thermal pools and the occasional steamy geyser. We saw long curling fingers of glacial ice 1,500-hundred-feet thick, rocky fjords, magnificent waterfalls, uplifted basalt columns, man-made fireworks fired from atop icebergs, puffins in flight and thousands of acres of moss-covered lava beds flanked by green hay fields dotted with sheep, cows and sturdy, purebred Icelandic horses.\n\nJust the name Iceland inspires mystery, chilled imagery, a sense of other-worldliness. Think a little bit each of Wales, Scotland, New Zealand, Hawaii, North Dakota, Yellowstone National Park and the rock-strewn moon; NASA sent its early astronauts and moon buggies to Iceland for lunar vehicle training.\n\nIceland is way up there between Norway and Greenland where the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans meet in chilly embrace. About 11 percent of it is covered in glacial ice. The moderating influence is the Gulf Stream which flows along the southern and western coast and makes the word “Iceland” a bit of a misnomer – but also producing endlessly changing weather as Arctic air flows across it, and 140 inches of annual rain in some areas.\n\nIceland’s history is worthy of its geology. About the size of Kentucky, no humans bothered to show up on it at all until about the 8th century when some Irish monks sailed in seeking solitude.\n\nNo problem.\n\nOver the next 1,000 years or so, Vikings and various Danish and Norwegians entities, farmers, fishermen, religious figures and kings argued and fought over the island. The sometimes bloody squabbles were accompanied by trade restrictions, smugglers, pirates, sages, pagan rituals, hardy farmers, early government, rumbling earthquakes, massive, fiery volcanoes – and a resultant population exodus.\n\nOne of the worst volcanoes – the 1783 Laki eruption – lasted eight months. The now estimated 122 million tons of sulfur dioxide, rivers of molten lava and endless acid rain killed off 60 percent of the livestock and one-quarter of the population.\n\nThe fallout poisoned the soil, blanketed Europe in foggy, volcanic haze, saw thousands die of starvation, dropped winter temperatures across all the northern latitudes – and yes, killed enough crops and livestock across Europe to be given some credit for sparking the 1789 French Revolution.\n\nIt was, as one Icelandic guide put it, a dark ages that lasted about 1,000 years until WWII when British and American troops stationed there somewhat brought the country to world light, and larger possibilities. The eventual tourism boom, now close to 1,000,000 visitors a year – is three times the country’s population and a great help in the recovery from its 2008 economic crash.\n\nAdding to the Icelandic story, more than half of its 300 glaciers flow near or directly over volcanoes, creating the continual possibility – and some historic reality – of enormous blocks of ice, boulders and flood waters spilling across the landscape and tearing out roads and bridges while hurtling toward the sea. Global warming already is melting about 11 billion tons of ice a year – with forecasts of worse.\n\nSo what are its 320,000 residents – most of who live in or near the very modern tourist city of Reykjavik – doing there?\n\nIt’s home, say the locals. It’s educational and longevity levels are among the best in the world. It has a proud history, unmatched environment, inner toughness and welcoming attitude that began on our trip with an evening toast; warm shark on a toothpick; a local drink made of potato mash nicknamed “Black Death” and the timeless Icelandic toast “Skol.”\n\nIcelanders also well might ask what are all those millions of Americans doing living on the San Andreas Fault in California, or near the New Madrid fault zone in the middle of America whose last eruptions in 1811-12 rattled Louisville, was felt in New York, and sent the Mississippi River flowing backward.\n\nEqually important: What were the 18 of us doing there on a Road Scholar journey? The word “challenging” is a good place to start, but Iceland provided us so much more than climate, geology and history lessons:\n\nWe landed at the Reykjavik-Keflavik airport after an almost six-hour flight from Washington, D.C., mostly strangers in a strange land. Our first major stop was the Blue Lagoon, a huge, touristy spa dug into lava rock and filled with ice-blue water heated to about 100 degrees.\n\nClouds of vapor hung over the water smelling faintly of sulfur. The air temperature was about 45 degrees. A cold wet rain was blowing in our faces. Hundreds of people were enjoying the water, the spa’s plunging, man-made waterfall, oblivious to the weather.\n\nWelcome to Iceland.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon also touches on the bigger Iceland story; geothermal energy. The spa water was first pumped up from more than a mile below the surface at a temperature of 470 degrees. It was passed through nearby power plant pumps where it’s used to generate electricity and to heat fresh water that’s used in a series of such plants to warm about 90 percent of Icelandic homes, along with huge greenhouses filled with tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nAs the 470-degree water is cooled down to the 100 degrees it is pumped over to the eager tourists and locals waist deep and deeper in the Blue Lagoon. Seven more such power plants are on the Icelandic drawing board to heat and power the country.\n\nOur journey generally continued eastward from Reykjavik. We moved along Iceland’s southern coast, with forays inland where evil-looking liquid bubbled in 500-degree pools, steam rose like fragile ghosts from vents in the ground and other thermal pools waited for the endless stream of hikers walking the broad green valleys.\n\nAdding to the mystery, some steam will rise from chimney-like vents above the ground, leading early settlers to the very logical conclusion that trolls lived in homes below ground, as well as having elves, dwarfs and other supernatural natives living in nearby small lava caves. The more modern Icelanders use such venting steam in community “ovens’ to make bread.\n\nEarly in our seven-day stay about half the hiking group – some hiking novices and others world hiking veterans – paused in one walk, changed into bathing suits, and crawled into a thermal-heated mountain stream. Laughter and companionship comes easily in those places.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there we pushed uphill into a remote area where recent rainwater and glacier melt had sent streams to higher levels. The bare, green landscape flowed up and over in all directions. The only way out was to continually ford the swollen streams, carefully picking our way onto slippery rocks, ever thankful for the hiking poles that provided balance.\n\nWe climbing a grassy hill only to see it led to a steep, graveled slope on the far side. Our guide, Magnus Birgisson, a cheerful, caring man about the size of a small phone booth, braced himself in mid-slope and led us down. A few minutes later, reaching a rocky stream about 20-feet wide that required crossing in cold rushing water above our knees, he picked up one fallen hiker who slipped backpack deep in the stream and led her to the far shore.\n\nIt’s still hard to know how serious that crossing could have become. Two of our members took off their boots and waded across in bare feet. The rest of us resolutely marched on in squishy shoes. It was a 12-mile hike well above the challenges we could find at home. We wanted that. We just didn’t know when it was coming – or from where. We all believed in ourselves – and our guide. It was a good feeling.\n\nThe ancient Icelandic descriptive language can cause some problems for literal-minded, one-language Americans. Icelandic places are often named for the things that are there – or happened there. Thus the community Hallormsstadaskogur bears the name of the first farm in one area – Hallormur – and the large woods once there – Skogur.\n\nThe translation gets a little difficult to explain to the folks back home when the Road Scholar guide book says that day’s walking trip will be “in the area of Kirkjhubaejarklauster. We will see Fjardargljufur canyon, Systrastapi mountain and Systrafoss waterfall.”\n\nMostly leading us down that multisyllabic, consonant-laden path was our other guide, Hjalti Bjornsson, a solid, bearded Icelandic fact-machine with degrees in education, mathematics and theology, incredible hiking skills and a droll sense of humor that led to the best quote of the trip.\n\n“We are living in the solution, not the problem,” he said at one key point when our hiking schedule – almost inevitably – didn’t match our hiking reality, particularly in terms of difficulty of the walk. We all soon accepted that as part of the Icelandic bargain.\n\nWe learned a great deal of the country’s heritage at the Skogar Museum of Folk Art with its 15,000 artifacts and outdoor grouping of the grim, unheated, unlighted stone-and-sod homes of the past. Our guide there spoke of Viking heroes, the long winter nights in that part of the world and the 16-oar boats used by fishermen to row out into the tumultuous North Atlantic to catch fish.\n\nBut only after they had finished the seasonal farm chores.\n\nThe museum is very close to Skogafoss, a stunning 200-foot waterfall that thunders down into the mind, spirit and Icelandic lore; there’s often a rainbow in front of it and a still undiscovered chest of gold beneath it.\n\nEqually impressive is Gullfoss – or “Golden Falls” – where river water plunges 100 feet in two massive, white cascades, and Seljalandsfoss, another 200-foot cascade with the added charm of being able to walk behind it in misty sunlight and make a wish. WARNING: The wish will only come true if you don’t look back on your return to the bus.\n\nLater in the journey we all rode a tourist-boat-on-wheels into the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon where dozens of icebergs were floating on their journey to the sea; massive, blue-white, water-carved creatures dating back 500 to 750 years stretched out in silence before us.\n\nUp close and personal with glaciers is possible, too. We passed many hikers armed with determined looks and pointy, glacier-climbing gear.\n\nBeing a visitor – a witness – to such geological history adds to the lure of Iceland. You can drive for miles and see only immense fields of black lava covered in dull-green moss.\n\nBut get out of the bus and poke among the lava and moss and you’ll see wildflowers, conifers, and recovering birch and willow trees. Hasn’t the earth done this before? Can dinosaur resurgence be far behind?\n\nNowhere in Iceland can suddenly become a somewhere. We drove for almost an hour around a massive dormant volcano and along a curling, often one-lane road bulldozed in black rock and ash to find our crowded national park site – with its tourist-packed thermal pool.\n\nAnd that somewhere in Iceland can be special. Our last long trek was in Vatnajokull National Park, site of the largest glacier in Europe.\n\nWe hiked 12 miles from sea level to 2,300 feet, picking our way up steep slopes past jagged pieces of rock, a thick river of ice and icebergs below us, the volcano-formed mountains rising above us; Iceland frozen in time in the silver morning light.\n\nAlong the way we passed Svartifoss – the “Black Waterfall” – where white water plunges over black basalt columns. Later in the day, tired, determined, pushing on because we had to, the seeing and the being there melded together as one; all so challenging – and all so worth it.\n\nBob Hill is a retired Courier-Journal columnist and feature writer.

Kame'eleihiwa, whose family's personal akua is Pele, said there are over 400,000 element gods in Hawaiian tradition.\n\nLegend has it that Pele was born in Tahiti, but after angering her sister Na-maka-o-kaha'i, the akua of the sea, Pele was banished from the island. The akua embarked on a journey in exile in pursuit of a fiery dwelling.\n\n\"She looked for a place to dig the fire pit and make her home,\" Kame'eleihiwa explained. \"And she finally finds that island and the place is called Kilauea.\"\n\nFor 100 generations, Kame'eleihiwa said Hawaiian women have shaped their identities off the beauty of her volatile eruptions and the magnitude of her strength, which is documented in photographs displaying her vibrant red hue.\n\nMadame Pele\n\nSometimes referred to as Madame Pele, or Tutu – grandmother – Pele is hailed as the powerful force behind Kilauea's decades-long eruptions.\n\nThe volcano has been in a constant, on-off state of eruption since 1983, although this eruption is a more severe case.\n\n\"She is very dynamic, sometimes very angry. Quick to anger and quick to forgive. But she’s a force to be reckoned with,\" explained Kame'eleihiwa.\n\nKame'eleihiwa said Pele will change form from fire into a human body. She will appear as an old woman with red hair on the side of the road, or a young vibrant mother giving birth.\n\nA sacred tradition\n\nThe personification of elements into akuas is a long-held practice of Hawaiians who remain connected to their ancestors through chants, songs and prayers about the natural world. Kame'eleihiwa said everything has a divine purpose, which Hawaiians take care to acknowledge and honor in their cultural rites.\n\nKekuhi Kealiikanakaole, who lives on the volcanic landscape as the creator and trainer for Kumu Hula, said that Pele teaches Hawaiians how to live on an island.\n\n\"We must treat the landscape and others on the landscape as if our lives depend on one another-people, forest, trees, fresh water,\" she said. \"The Pele reminds us that as short as our human life is we must be good stewards.\"\n\nShe also said people in her community \"come to pray, make offerings, watch in silence, or just come to be in the presence of creation because Pele is a visually dramatic phenomenon.\"\n\nAs a hula performer, Kealiikanakaole honors the memory of the property and lives lost through the years of Pele's volcanic rage by sharing family stories, and through hula's traditional songs, chants and dances.\n\nKame'eleihiwa understands that some will disregard the legend of Pele and other goddesses, she said that native Hawaiians understand how their ancestors wanted them to treat the land, which is passed down through messages given by akuas.\n\n“I think before people rebuild houses, they should refer to Hawaiian experts,\" she explains. What often happens is the Hawaiian system is disregarded as superstition, and you can say that, but Pele is erupting, so that’s something.\"\n\nAs the Honolulu Civil Beat reported, not everyone shares the ancient belief that Pele is a deity.\n\n'This is Pele's place'\n\nSometimes, Kame'eleihiwa said, Pele needs to cleanse the land. It's the akua's way of reminding the people how the island must be treated, and that she feels the desecration of the land.\n\n\"This is Pele’s place,\" Kame'eleihiwa said. \"And we as descendants of akua and descendants of the land need to live in harmony with the elements and the land. Humans are not the most important things on the earth, the elements are.”\n\nAt the end of the day, Pele will take what is rightfully hers.\n\n\"As long as Pele is erupting, we say she is dancing,\" said Kame'eleihiwa, who referenced the sudden uptick in earthquakes as Pele in labor. \"She is giving birth to land.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/15/whitewater-fire-mount-jefferson-wilderness-forest-service-allow-burn-out-control/941739001/", "title": "Did the Forest Service allow Whitewater Fire to burn out of control?", "text": "Heavy rain and snow brought the Whitewater Fire to an end nearly three months ago, but questions about how the blaze was managed have remained controversial in the Santiam Canyon.\n\nThe 11,500-acre fire, that burned in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, was among Oregon's most damaging of 2017.\n\nIt cost $39 million to fight, threatened private land, torched some of Oregon’s most popular hiking trails and was blamed for harming summer tourism in Detroit and Sisters, especially during August’s solar eclipse.\n\nThe main accusation is that the U.S. Forest Service either ignored or didn’t take action against the fire in its early stages, essentially allowing it to grow out of control.\n\nThat narrative became so ubiquitous that even Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader said he’d heard that version of events.\n\nThere also were claims the Forest Service lied about when they discovered the fire, misrepresented how the fire actually started, or set the fire themselves to avoid dealing with the mass of people expected for the Aug. 21 solar eclipse.\n\nThe Statesman Journal requested all public records related to the fire during its early stages and interviewed more than a dozen people about the Forest Service’s handling of the Whitewater Fire.\n\nIn more than 300 pages of reports and inner-departmental emails, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, a consistent timeline emerges of how the fire was attacked and how officials became aware of it.\n\nHere are some of the things our reporting turned up:\n\nThe Forest Service attacked the fire when it was small and confined to the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, but also faced delay and a crucial day without aircraft dropping water.\n\nThe Forest Service was aware of lightning strikes in the area where the Whitewater Fire started, but there's no evidence they were monitoring the fire before it was reported July 23.\n\nThe Forest Service didn't follow up on a potentially important detail about how the fire started.

Documents show chainsaw and water pumps were approved at 9:49 a.m.\n\nThe firefighting team hiked up Whitewater Trail to the blaze, which was around one acre in size. They cut down burning trees and started building a line around the fire, hoping to starve it of fuel. They used water from a bladder bag and pumps.\n\nBut there was a problem: The water-dropping helicopters and smokejumpers requested to help fight the fire never materialized.\n\nThen, fueled by winds, the fire began spreading.\n\nBy 12:42 p.m., the fire had grown to 12 to 15 acres. And records show frustration among the crew over whether helicopters were coming.\n\n“Do we have an update on ships?” said one member of the team over radio communications.\n\n“With air support, the folks on the ground think we can catch it,” said another communication.\n\nBy 3:30 p.m., the fire had grown to an estimated 60 acres, according to radio communications.\n\n“We asked for helicopters with buckets to drop water and smoke jumpers,” McMahan said. “Unfortunately, there were other fires breaking that day across the region and we were not seen as high priority by the agency command in Portland that assigns resources.”\n\nThat night, the fire team slept at Whitewater Trailhead.\n\nThe fire had already started creeping into the steep Whitewater Creek drainage.\n\nJuly 25\n\nA new fire team took command and headed toward the fire with a crew totaling 85 and five helicopters dropping water.\n\nBut even with water drops from helicopters, and pumps pulling water out of Whitewater Creek, the fire grew.\n\nHigh winds sent out blasts of embers, starting 15 to 20 spot fires by the afternoon. The fire pushed east along Sentinel Ridge and toward Jefferson Park, still filled with hikers and backpackers.\n\nThe team attempted to suppress the fire “while going easy on the land,” according to orders from McMahan. One example: helicopters weren’t allowed drop fire retardant, only water.\n\nRetardant was not used in the early stages of fighting the fire, even though some members of the team requested its use, according to radio communications.\n\nIn general, Forest Service policy \"discourages the application of fire-retardant chemicals\" in wilderness areas.\n\nBy day’s end, the fire was 75 acres and four trails had been closed.\n\nJuly 26 - 31\n\nOne of the first maps produced of the Whitewater Fire shows the challenge that firefighters faced.\n\nWhile they could cut a hand line around the fire’s northern perimeter, near the Whitewater Trail, the southern side was on steep cliffs dropping into Whitewater Creek.\n\nThe fire had \"slopped over the ridge\" on the first day of firefighting, but by July 26, it began spreading downhill fast, with flaming trees and boulders careening into the valley.\n\nA hotshot team assessed the situation to determine whether the fire could be stopped on the downhill side.\n\n“A lot of discussion took place and two (hotshot crews) turned down the mission to go direct on the south end where it dives off the rim into the Whitewater drainage,” wrote Dave Johnson, incident commander of the Whitewater Fire.\n\n“This was deemed unsafe due to steepness, crumbly mountain hemlock snags and potential for rolling material to be very high,” Johnson wrote. “At this point, all we could do is hold what progress was made and work with helicopters to slow progression.”\n\nThe next day, July 28, fire teams \"abandoned the east side entirely,\" Johnson wrote, essentially letting it burn into the wilderness.\n\nThe goal changed from putting the fire out to stopping it from advancing west toward State Highway 22 and private timberlands, while checking it on the north and east with helicopters drops, documents show.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams were sent to evacuate backpackers from Jefferson Park, a popular backcountry camping area, as the fire spread to 167 acres July 30. At this point, 127 people were assigned to the fire.\n\nAugust 1-10\n\nFueled by high winds and temperatures in the 100s, the fire expanded fivefold to 1,500 acres and then to 4,579 acres by Aug. 3.\n\nSmoke and ash rained down on nearby Detroit as the fire spread within a few miles of State Highway 22 and crossed outside of the wilderness boundary.\n\n“Record-setting heat, rugged terrain and top of the fire season — it doesn’t get any worse,” said Steve Zeil, fire behavior analyst for the incident team during a meeting in Detroit.\n\n“All the ingredients for extreme fire behavior (were) present.”\n\nFire teams stopped engaging the fire in the wilderness and instead focused on building containment lines on Forest Service Roads outside the wilderness.\n\nThe fire would end up burning 11,500 acres.\n\nDid the Forest Service know about the Whitewater Fire before July 23?\n\nOne of the most frequent accusations against the Forest Service is that officials knew about the lightning-struck “smoldering tree,” that would ignite the Whitewater Fire, far earlier than July 23.\n\nHere’s some background:\n\nOn the evening of June 25, a thunderstorm rolled across the Central Cascade Range and raked the forest with more than 100 lightning strikes.\n\nThe storm immediately sparked 12 different wildfires on Willamette National Forest. Conditions were still wet and the blazes were quickly doused.\n\nThe Forest Service continued to monitor the forest for any smoke because lightning often sparks fires weeks or months after the original strike.\n\nThey knew the general location of the lightning strikes, \"but it's impossible to know which ones might develop into a fire,\" Willamette National Forest fire investigator Dirk Rogers said.\n\nDocuments show six other wildfires, including some in wilderness areas, popping up in late July near Detroit, all of which were extinguished by fire teams before they grew larger than one acre.\n\nThere is no documentation of the Whitewater Fire, or smoke or flames near Whitewater Trail, before July 23, according to reports and emails reviewed by the Statesman Journal.\n\nEvery Whitewater Fire report documents July 23 as the first day the Forest Service became aware of the fire.\n\nMcMahan said the confusion was likely caused by a briefing he gave in late July to landowners around the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. He told landowners about the small fires started by the June 25 lightning storm and updated them on the status of the growing Whitewater Fire.\n\nMcMahan said he regrets that he did not make it clear that the Whitewater Fire, while caused by a lightning strike in June, was not visible or located until July 23.\n\n\"The lightning strike tree was within easy sight distance from the Whitewater Trail,\" he said. \"That trail receives heavy hiking use. If there was a visible fire there from June into July, a number of hikers would have reported a fire.\"\n\nDid the Forest Service 'sit on the sidelines' until the fire was outside the wilderness?\n\nThis claim is another frequent accusation against the Forest Service.\n\nPictures, reports and eyewitness accounts show the Forest Service and fire teams fighting the Whitewater Fire while it was still confined to the Mount Jefferson Wilderness.\n\nThe Whitewater Fire didn't cross outside wilderness boundaries until Aug. 3 when it reached around 4,500 acres. More than 100 firefighters had been working the fire, both directly and indirectly, for a week and a half.\n\nNews releases detailing the progress of the fire while still in the wilderness are easily found online.\n\nDid the Forest Service start the fire to keep people out of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness due to concerns about eclipse crowds?\n\nThis accusation mostly popped up on social media.\n\nThere is no evidence the Forest Service intentionally started the fire. Prior to the fire breaking out, multiple emails detail the Forest Service preparing for an influx of people for the solar eclipse Aug. 21.\n\nIn one email, for example, officials detailed plans to bring wilderness toilets (called “Luggable Loos”) into Jefferson Park, while strategizing how to get them back out once they were full. Other emails consider overcrowded parking at trailheads.\n\nThere is no evidence the Forest Service was planning to keep people out.\n\nHow did a month-old lightning strike stay undetected for a month before starting a fire?\n\nThe Forest Service has consistently said that a holdover lightning strike, from the June 25 storm, was responsible for igniting the Whitewater Fire on July 23.\n\nFire investigator Dirk Rogers examined the area on July 25 and discovered a “strike tree.”\n\n“The general area around the point of origin was investigated and a lightning struck tree that had burned over and was horizontal on the ground was discovered,” Rogers wrote in his report.\n\nIn an interview, Rogers said that when he investigated, he came across a fallen tree that stood out because it had a long groove, likely caused by a lightning strike, that had been burning from the top downward.\n\n“Fire doesn’t normally burn from the top down, it burns from the bottom up,” Rogers said. “The groove in this tree was sitting upward, not underneath.\"\n\nRogers said an ember or spark was likely smoldering within the groove — putting out little heat or smoke. Then, the tree fell down and the fire ignited, he said.\n\n“That’s actually really common. Strike trees often won't put out much, if any, smoke until they get enough oxygen or fuel to kick it back up,” Rogers said. “It’s worth noting that that’s exactly what happened with two other fires in the same area right around the same time.”\n\nCould the Whitewater Fire have been human-caused?\n\nThere was one thing missing in Rogers’ report.\n\nIn sections of the report that ask the investigator to consider whether a fire was human caused, Rogers wrote that there was “no evidence of any human activity … noted in the area.”\n\n“There is a hiking trail within 200 feet of the origin area but origin area is not an ideal place to set up a camp. Better places are within 1/4 mile of the origin,” he wrote.\n\nBut Lydia Segura, the 17-year-old who originally reported the fire, said she discovered an abandoned Kelty tent on the edge of the flames.\n\n\"The tent was set up, the stakes were down and it was starting to melt from the heat of the fire,\" Segura said. \"It obviously had not been slept in and there was some toilet paper and trash, like beans and a pile of rice that looked as though they had been cooked and then dumped out.\n\n\"It was in a really strange spot, on the side of the hill, and it struck me that it wouldn't be a place where I'd want to sleep.\"\n\nSegura said she picked up the tent and garbage that was about to burn and packed it out.\n\nLater, Segura relayed the information about the campsite to former Forest Service official Kenny Schade.\n\nSchade passed that information to Forest Service district fire management officer Brandon Coville, documents show. But the information appears to have stopped there.\n\nFire investigator Rogers said he never got that information. But even if he had gotten it, Rogers said, it wouldn’t have changed his opinion about how the fire started.\n\n“There was no physical evidence that would lead me to determine it was human-caused, while on the other hand, we had a strike tree in the fire origin area,” Rogers said. “I did my investigation following the scientific method.”\n\nSegura said she wasn’t sure what to make of the situation.\n\n“When I talked to the Forest Service, (Kenny) said he wanted to follow through but had to talk to a manager and then never responded again,” she said. “I thought the tent being right next to the fire was pretty suspicious.”\n\nForest Service officials said once they had evidence of the lightning-struck tree conclusion from Rogers, they moved onto the next stage of tasks.\n\n\"Our professional fire investigator found no evidence of camping nor of a human-caused fire. What the investigator found, and documented, was a lightning struck tree at the fire origin,\" McMahan said.\n\nThe 2017 wildfire season was one for the record books. The 70,000 acres that burned during three months in Willamette National Forest was more than burned during the last 20 years combined, officials said.\n\nZach Urness has been an outdoors writer, photographer and videographer in Oregon for 10 years.

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}]}

Similar decisions providing opportunities for disadvantaged communities have become commonplace in many countries since the 1960s. Yet the highest court in the U.S. has effectively banned the possibility in America.\n\nSince 1978, American universities have been permitted to consider race as a factor in admissions. Supporters argue that such policies — also known as positive discrimination — level the playing field for historically disadvantaged groups, but critics claim they unfairly discriminate and should be illegal.\n\nPro: boost for education\n\n\"Since nine states already have bans on affirmative action, it's easy to know what will happen if affirmative action is outlawed,\" Natasha Warikoo, a Tufts University professor who studies racial equity in education, said at The Conversation before the Supreme Court ruling. Studies on college enrollment in those states indicate that the number of Black, Hispanic and Native American undergraduate students will decline in the long term.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The result of the Supreme Court ruling will ultimately be \"institutions that are less representative, less intellectually stimulating, and less equipped to serve an increasingly diverse America,\" Lee said at Science.org .\n\nA year after affirmative action was struck down, colleges began releasing admissions data for the class of 2028, the first class to be impacted by the decision. Still, it may be too early to draw conclusions based on the limited data available. With only a few dozen schools reporting their enrollments, \"we still can't definitively speak to how racially diverse this first post-affirmative action class will be,\" Michaele Turnage Young of the Equal Protection Initiative at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said to Vox . So far, \"there isn't much good news in the data for students of color,\" Vox said. Many schools have \"yet to implement race-neutral policies aimed at fostering diversity in their classes, which would comply with the Supreme Court's decision.\"\n\nCon: a form of discrimination\n\nAdvocates often argue that affirmative action is necessary to correct historical injustice and that discrimination against some groups is so pervasive that it can only be corrected with reverse discrimination.\n\nBut \"critics of affirmative action argue that two wrongs do not make a right; that treating different racial groups differently will entrench racial antagonism and that societies should aim to be colour-blind,\" said The Economist.\n\nIn two lawsuits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina heard by the Supreme Court, the conservative-backed Students for Fair Admissions group argued that allowing colleges and universities to use race as a factor in deciding admission infringes civil rights legislation and is unconstitutional because it is discriminatory.\n\nIn ruling that race-based affirmative action programs in higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court agreed and \"it was right to do so,\" said The Economist.\n\nPro: improves productivity\n\nHigh-profile companies, including Apple, Starbucks and Ikea, joined together to file briefs at the Supreme Court arguing that racial diversity improves decision-making at their companies, said NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on \"All Things Considered.\" Similarly, a \"bunch of big law firms also weighed in on the value of a racially diverse pool of talent coming in to them.\"\n\nThe same has proved to be the case in the military, according to Travis Knoll, a historian at the University of North Carolina. At The Conversation, Knoll cited the Vietnam War, during which racial tensions in the ranks stemming from a lack of Black officers \"led to at least 300 fights in a two-year-period that resulted in 71 deaths.\" This \"drove home to the military the idea that diversity in leadership was extremely important\" and \"also began the military's use of affirmative action,\" including race-conscious admissions policies at service academies and in Reserve Officers' Training Corps progams.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has declared affirmative action policies in college and university admissions unconstitutional, \"questions are arising over whether the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace\" and elsewhere, said Lauren Aratani at The Guardian.\n\nCon: increases class inequalities\n\nSomewhere along the decades, affirmative action \"has lost its way,\" said law experts Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. at The Atlantic. \"The largest, most aggressive preferences are usually reserved for upper-middle-class minorities on many of whom they inflict significant academic harm,\" they added, \"whereas more modest policies that could help working-class and poor people of all races are given short shrift.\"\n\n\"We want diverse stock traders, corporate-boardroom members, and tenured professors,\" said Jay Caspian Kang at The New Yorker, but \"it's clear that what's at stake isn't a vision of social and racial justice that would ameliorate inequalities for a broad swath of people but, rather, a fight for spots in the elite ranks of society.\"\n\n\"I think there's a better way than what we have now,\" a Harvard student named only as Kyle said to Fox News. \"You have people of color who actually come from really privileged families, and they're getting benefited from this program, when you have people from other races who might not have any privilege in their background, and they don't benefit from it.\"\n\n\"Affirmative action betrayed Black America,\" said Inaya Folarin Iman at The Telegraph . \"Far from addressing long-standing structural inequalities, it institutionalized the deeply racist idea that Black people were incapable of attaining positions of excellence and high achievement on merit alone.\" It suggested that \"only through reliance on paternalistic white offerings could they ever succeed.\"\n\nPro: backed by public\n\nPolls show that affirmative action policies have become increasingly accepted over time. Gallup polling found that public support in the U.S. stood at between 47% to 50% between 2001 and 2005 before climbing to 54% in 2016 and then 61% in 2018.

At 16, she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth is pictured in 1945 standing by an Auxiliary Territorial Service first aid truck wearing an officer's uniform. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nWartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the traditional constraints of royal life.\n\nIn 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles.\n\nWhen victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nPeacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later.\n\nA youthful monarch\n\nWith her father’s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual “Trooping the Colour” military parade in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, while Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father’s death.\n\nShe was now Queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe next decade saw the young monarch settle into her role. After her coronation in 1953, she embarked on numerous official overseas trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine.\n\nThese international forays came even as the disintegration of Britain’s empire hastened. India had gained independence from its colonial power in 1947, before Elizabeth became Queen. Dozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nThe Queen meanwhile embraced her role as Head of the Commonwealth, visiting almost all of its member states – starting with a lengthy Commonwealth tour in 1953 and 1954.\n\nIn 1964, the Queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let-up in her busy schedule.\n\nBy the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married – drawing huge crowds of well-wishers.\n\nWhile indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas tours and official visits around the UK – one of which, in 1976, saw her become one of the first people to send an email.\n\nThere were family problems when her sister’s marriage collapsed, and constitutional issues as debate grew among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977.\n\nAnother royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the Queen’s life.\n\nDivorce, fire and Diana’s death\n\nThe Queen’s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew’s wife, was photographed topless with an American financial manager.\n\nTo cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furor broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration.\n\nThis year was not one “on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” the Queen said in a speech later. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.”\n\nThese problems overshadowed the Queen as she made an historic visit to meet South African President Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana’s tragic death in 1997, when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread public outpourings of grief.\n\nThis marked a turning point.\n\nAfter days of silence, the Queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana’s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nAfter Diana, the Queen’s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family.\n\nThis was evident in 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. It was capped eight years later when Britain’s parliament ended the principle of men taking precedence over women in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nShe witnessed two of her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, graduate as military officers in 2006 and five years later oversaw the marriage of William and Catherine, the woman who – as the wife of the now heir to the throne – will one day succeed her as Britain’s Queen. She also attended the wedding of Harry to Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry watch a flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace as part of events to mark the centenary of the RAF on July 10, 2018 in London. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2012, the Queen’s diamond jubilee was celebrated around the Commonwealth, culminating in a glittering river pageant on the Thames in London, and a concert showcasing some of the best music from her six decades on the throne.\n\nThree years later, she surpassed Queen Victoria’s 63-year-rule to become the longest-reigning British monarch and, in 2016, she marked her 90th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world.\n\nIn February 2022, she marked the start of her platinum jubilee year, as she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years.\n\nFamily upheaval\n\nThe Queen’s final years were punctuated by challenges as well as celebrations, however.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through Britain in 2020, she gave two televised addresses in quick succession, one calling for unity in the face of the pandemic and the other, still amid a national lockdown, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.\n\nBut while rallying the nation’s spirits, the Queen was facing upheaval within her own family. Less than two years after their spectacular Windsor Castle wedding, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals and leaving Britain.\n\nThey subsequently set up home with son Archie in California and, in a March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, accused “the firm” of leaving Meghan unprotected against racist abuse and unfair media coverage, as well as having neglected her mental health concerns. The couple – whose daughter Lilibet, named in honor of the Queen, was born in June 2021 – also made a damaging allegation of racism by an unnamed member of the royal family, although Winfrey later said they had clarified that this was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s “favorite son,” had been forced to step back from public duties after a disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC over his association with prominent sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, the Queen sought to distance the royal institution from a civil sex abuse lawsuit brought against Andrew in the United States by stripping him of his HRH status and royal patronages permanently. He subsequently settled the case out of court for an undisclosed figure and continues to reject the allegations against him.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021 in Windsor, England. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nIn April 2021, the Queen suffered the loss of Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years and the longest-serving consort in British history. Pandemic restrictions meant she cut a lonely figure at his funeral, scaled back in terms of guests but still marked with military pomp.\n\nElizabeth returned to her royal duties within days, now a widow but still dedicated to a lifetime of service. She even continued with light duties after testing positive for Covid-19 in February 2022.\n\nBut as the year wore on, the monarch was forced to significantly slim down her diary due to mobility issues. On Tuesday, she met with outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace to do so.\n\nThe nation had come together to mark her platinum jubilee in June 2022 – a crowning achievement in a long and storied life.\n\nBy the time of her death in September, she had reigned for a little over 70 years – a constant, if regally distant, presence in the lives of several generations of Britons.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Barry Neild"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

Montreal must win in regulation Saturday to clinch outright. It can also get in with some help. Four other Eastern Conference teams are still alive entering Saturday.\n\nWho wins the Pacific Division title?\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights need a regulation win or a Los Angeles Kings loss to clinch the title. If that happens, the Kings and Edmonton Oilers would meet for the fourth year in the row in the first round. Edmonton won the last three but more than likely will start this series on the road.\n\nWho wins the Central Division title?\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets need one point to clinch. If that happens, the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche would play each other with the twice-traded Mikko Rantanen being the big storyline.

Kekalainen departs Sunday for the world championship, where he’ll get a chance to scout Sweden’s Leo Carlsson and Canada’s Adam Fantilli ― two top center prospects in this year’s draft.\n\nThe Blue Jackets have the third pick and one of those two players will be available after the Chicago Blackhawks and Anaheim Ducks make their selections, which are widely expected to be Connor Bedard first and Fantilli second. Traveling to worlds would also give Kekalainen a chance to interview international coaching candidates such as Jukka Jalonen, Finland’s national team coach.\n\nMike Babcock and Peter Laviolette are also candidates, and both have won the Stanley Cup with previous teams.\n\nBabcock comes with baggage from his previous NHL coaching stops with the Anaheim Ducks, Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs ― who fired him in November 2019 with four years left on an eight-year, $50 million contract. Former players spoke up after his firing to depict Babcock as verbally abusive, which stirred a strong backlash among fans on social media.\n\nLaviolette doesn’t have that kind of stain, but his next stop will be his sixth in the NHL and the price tag to land him is expected to be high. He’s also a top candidate to replace Gerard Gallant with the New York Rangers.\n\nAnaheim and the Calgary Flames also have vacancies that could be filled by experienced coaches, including Gallant, Darryl Sutter, Bruce Boudreau or Claude Julien. The field may eventually include Joel Quenneville, a three-time winner of the Stanley Cup who was suspended by the NHL for his role in the Chicago Blackhawks’ cover-up of Kyle Beach’s sexual assault allegations.\n\nAccording to TSN's Darren Dreger, Quenneville will meet with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman after the Stanley Cup playoffs conclude to discuss his eligibility for coaching jobs. The NHL hasn't released a start date for the Stanley Cup final round, but conference finals could go until May 31 if there's a Game 7 needed to decide the Western Conference final between the Dallas Stars and Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nThat would likely mean the Cup final would start the first week of June and could last until the week of June 11-17.\n\nThe lone internal candidate is associate coach Pascal Vincent, who was a finalist for the head coach role in 2021 before the Blue Jackets promoted Brad Larsen. Vincent doesn’t have NHL head coach experience other than subbing for Larsen when the former coach was either sick or attending funerals.\n\nVincent is highly regarded in coaching circles, has five years of experience as head coach of the Manitoba Moose in the American Hockey League and spent five years on the Winnipeg Jets’ bench as an NHL assistant.\n\nbhedger@dispatch.com\n\n@BrianHedger\n\nGet more Columbus Blue Jackets talk on the Cannon Fodder podcast", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2025/04/18/2025-nhl-playoffs-predictions-first-round-bracket/83120785007/", "title": "NHL playoff predictions 2025: Which teams win first round series ...", "text": "The NHL is rolling out its playoff schedule slowly with two Western Conference games on Saturday and the 2024 champion Florida Panthers not starting their Stanley Cup defense until Tuesday.\n\nThe Panthers will face the cross-state rival Tampa Bay Lightning in what could be one of the best series of the first round. The 2024 Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers will try to make it four years in a row of beating the Los Angeles Kings in the first round.\n\nWhich eight teams will make it to the second round?\n\nUSA TODAY's Jason Anderson, Mike Brehm and Jace Evans give their predictions for the first round of the 2025 Stanley Cup playoffs:\n\nJason Anderson: Capitals in 6. The Caps have had some ugly losses in recent weeks to teams that missed the playoffs, including dropping a recent back-to-back pair of games to Columbus by a combined 11-1 score. I'm taking Washington, but with the Habs holding opponents to just 2.4 goals per game over their final 10 regular-season outings, this might be closer than a No. 1-vs.-No. 8 series ought to be.\n\nMike Brehm: Capitals in 6. The Canadiens are in the same position as the Capitals were last season: clinching on the last game of the season and facing one of the best teams in the league. Those Capitals were swept. These Canadiens won't be, but they are facing a Washington team that has improved in every aspect of the game, even with its late-season issues.\n\nJace Evans: Capitals in 6. Most of the focus on Washington lately has been on Alex Ovechkin's historic goal chase. While epic, it also obscured the fact that the Caps haven't been playing all that well. Still, the NHL's most surprising team this season should have enough to win this series, particularly if goalie Logan Thompson can return (and return to form).\n\nCarolina Hurricanes vs. New Jersey Devils\n\nJason Anderson: Hurricanes in 5. Neither of these teams is coming into the playoffs on a hot streak, with ho-hum goaltending and more recent losses than wins. However, Carolina skates too well and is too deep for a Devils team that hasn't figured out how to replace Jack Hughes (shoulder).\n\nMike Brehm: Hurricanes in 5. The Devils are more than Jack Hughes, but New Jersey will miss his game-breaking ability against a Hurricanes team that doesn't give you much free space.\n\nJace Evans: Hurricanes in 4. The season-ending injury to Jack Hughes was so deflating for the Devils. It's just hard to imagine them mustering much of a fight without one of the game's top players.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs vs. Ottawa Senators\n\nJason Anderson: Maple Leafs in 6. Toronto is clearly the better team here, and is built for playoff hockey. However, no team enters the postseason with a more anxious fanbase thanks to how many times the Leafs have crashed out of the first round (it's eight times in nine postseason trips since the 2004-05 lockout, if you're counting). The Leafs will make it hard on themselves, but they have too much of an edge to pick against them in this series.\n\nMike Brehm: Maple Leafs in 6. This is when we'll find out how much the coaching change to Craig Berube will help. The Maple Leafs have been good in the regular season and not so good in the playoffs. But Berube has them playing the right way.\n\nJace Evans: Maple Leafs in 5. Not to be hyperbolic but if the Maple Leafs somehow manage to lose in the first round this year they should fold the franchise. Jokes aside, Toronto is the superior team and has its best opportunity to make a deep run since 2021 ... when it collapsed in the first round against another Canadian team.\n\nTampa Bay Lightning vs. Florida Panthers\n\nJason Anderson: Lightning in 7. This one feels like it could be a classic. It's hard to pick against the defending champions, but Florida has been too inconsistent down the stretch to make another long playoff run. Tampa Bay has the edge in goal with Andrei Vasilevskiy, Nikita Kucherov has been spectacular, and that's enough to make the home-ice edge in this series count.\n\nMike Brehm: Lightning in 6. The Panthers will have to play two games on the road without suspended Aaron Ekblad. And they're facing a Lightning team that made some smart pickups at the trade deadline. The Panthers were busy, too, adding Seth Jones and Brad Marchand, but they also have had injury issues.\n\nJace Evans: Lightning in 6. Beyond questions about Matthew Tkachuk's health (and effectiveness after so much time away), Florida has just played an awful lot of hockey the last two years. It's very hard to make three consecutive runs to the Stanley Cup Final and it's an even bigger ask to begin that journey on the road against a team as good as Tampa.\n\nWinnipeg Jets vs. St. Louis Blues\n\nJason Anderson: Jets in 6. The Presidents' Trophy has been a bit of a curse, but it's hard to pick against Winnipeg in this series. The Blues have played the Jets close this season, but St. Louis gives away too many chances in front and has too much trouble killing penalties to convert that into a major upset.\n\nMike Brehm: Jets in 5. The Jets play a strong defensive game and Connor Hellebuyck is heading toward a second consecutive Vezina Trophy. That didn't help him in last season's playoffs, when he was blown out by Colorado, but the Blues aren't the Avalanche and don't have their firepower.\n\nJace Evans: Blues in 6. Connor Hellebuyck is the best goalie in the world. But he's been a disaster the prior two postseasons. The Jets were the best team in the league this year. But no Presidents' Trophy winner has made the Stanley Cup Final since 2013 and only two since then have even made the conference finals (2015 and 2024 Rangers). I'm picking the upset.\n\nDallas Stars vs. Colorado Avalanche\n\nJason Anderson: Avalanche in 6. Plenty of data points suggest the Avs' record isn't quite as good as it should be, and that Dallas has had a bit of luck on its side. It's also impossible to ignore that the Stars enter the playoffs on a shocking seven-game losing streak. Despite Dallas having home ice, Colorado's scoring depth should be able to wear the Stars down.\n\nMike Brehm: Avalanche in 5. I had toyed with picking the Stars to reach the Stanley Cup Final. But that was before they cratered down the stretch. If Miro Heiskanen remains out and Jason Robertson misses time, Dallas will have a tough time.\n\nJace Evans: Avalanche in 7. The Stars are deep and seem like a title contender once again ... but they don't have the same level of star-power Colorado has. Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar will help the Avs find a way.\n\nVegas Golden Knights vs. Minnesota Wild\n\nJason Anderson: Golden Knights in 5. Vegas won all three regular-season meetings, and while the Wild have the best goalie in the series in Filip Gustavsson, Minnesota is also one of two teams to get into the playoffs despite a negative goal difference (-11) on the season. The Golden Knights are the stronger team top to bottom.\n\nMike Brehm: Golden Knights in 6. The Golden Knights lost key players to free agency but are a deeper team because of the emergence of players such as Pavel Dorofeyev. They didn't even make a stunning move at the deadline, just bringing back Reilly Smith. The Golden Knights have plenty of leftovers from the 2023 Stanley Cup champions and could go far.\n\nJace Evans: Golden Knights in 6. Minnesota has gotten healthy at the right time, but Vegas is a deep, balanced group that is loaded with championship experience. The Wild haven't won a playoff series since 2015.\n\nLos Angeles Kings vs. Edmonton Oilers\n\nJason Anderson: Kings in 6. It's NHL tradition at this point for the Kings and Oilers to play in the first round, but this year Los Angeles finally gets one over on Edmonton. Darcy Kuemper gives the Kings an edge between the pipes, and it's impossible to assume the Oilers' long list of dinged-up players can be at their best.\n\nMike Brehm: Kings in 7. The Kings are dominant at home and they have home-ice advantage in this series. The Oilers will miss injured Mattias Ekholm.\n\nJace Evans: Oilers in 7. The Oilers were hit by the injury bug about as hard as any team in the playoffs, and there remains eternal questions about their goaltending. And yet, if the big guns are in the lineup, I just trust they'll find a way to score goals and beat the Kings — as they have the prior three years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/shopping/2025/05/28/how-to-buy-florida-panthers-nhl-finals-tickets-stanley-cup-schedule-2025/83910257007/", "title": "How to buy Florida Panthers NHL Stanley Cup Finals tickets, schedule", "text": "AI-assisted summary The Florida Panthers are returning to the Stanley Cup Finals for the third consecutive year after defeating the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nTickets for Games 3, 4, and a potential Game 6 at the Panthers' home arena are available now.\n\nFor the third consecutive season, the Florida Panthers are headed to the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThe Panthers eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in five games, winning all three road games in the series including a wild back-and-forth Game 5, and will once again represent the Eastern Conference in the upcoming finals.\n\nFlorida defeated the Edmonton Oilers in seven games last year to win the team's first Cup in franchise history.\n\nWhile the Western Conference representative is not yet known, there's a good chance we will get a rematch of last year's finals, as Edmonton leads the Dallas Stars 3-1 in their best-of-seven game conference final.\n\nHere is everything you need to know in order to purchase Florida Panthers 2025 NHL Stanley Cup Finals tickets.\n\nFlorida Panthers Stanley Cup Finals tickets\n\nNo matter which team comes out of the West, the Panthers will start the Stanley Cup Finals on the road.

Throughout the afternoon and into the evening, most of the Red Wings were enjoying one last bash before scattering to their off-season locales. Their agenda called for sticks with little balls at the Orchards Golf Club in Washington Township, more camaraderie in the clubhouse and limousine rides home to be on the safe side. The guest of honor, naturally, was the Stanley Cup. Before the clock struck midnight, though, one of the greatest week’s in Michigan sports history suddenly turned into one of the most tragic.\n\nBack to reality: That first night — in an ordeal that lasted months and whose reverberations continue to this day — the details were sketchy and rumors were rampant. The givens: Russian defensemen Vladimir Konstantinov, 30, and Slava Fetisov, 39, and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, 43, were seriously injured in a limo accident in Birmingham while returning from the golf outing. Their white stretch limousine careered off southbound Woodward into the grassy median of the divided road and hit at tree, crumpling the front end. The trio and the driver were rushed to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Owner Mike Ilitch, who heard about a crash involving his team on television, arrived at the hospital about 10:45 p.m., dressed in a Wings windbreaker. “I’m concerned,” he said. “I’ve got to make sure my boys are taken care of.” Trainer John Wharton ran into the hospital around 11:30 p.m., followed by captain Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan. Other players followed. Konstantinov, Fetisov and Mnatsakanov had left the Orchards about 90 minute before the rest of team, which was to regroup at Chris Osgood’s home in Birmingham. When Yzerman’s cell phone rang with news on the accident, he gathered the team and delivered the grim details. “It was the worst feeling ever,” swingman Mathieu Dandenault said.\n\nA reason to believe: Over the weekend, Konstantinov’s and Mnatsakanov’s lives were in the balance, listed in critical condition with massive head injuries. Fetisov was in fair condition with a chest injury and a bruised lung. The limo driver, Richard Gnida, also was in fair condition. Helene St. James of the Free Press provided the rest of the story on the limousine accident and its aftermath in her 2020 book, “The Big 50: Detroit Red Wings,” which also appeared in “Stanleytown 25 Years Later.”\n\nHe forced himself out of his hospital bed, ignoring the pain in his ribs, and limped into the next room. It was the middle of the night, and the only people around were staff.\n\nIn the other room, Slava Fetisov found Vladimir Konstantinov, his body covered in tubes and bandages, attached to monitors and IVs and a ventilator. Fetisov had been through this before. Twelve years earlier, in June 1985, Fetisov had been involved in a car accident that killed his brother, Anatoly. Fetisov couldn’t face another loss.\n\n“A nurse told me that after I was gone, Slava came to Vladdie's room,” Irina Konstantinov, Vladimir’s wife, said in a 1998 interview. “He could barely walk. He kind of crawled into the room, and he was sitting there in the dark next to Vladdie and he was crying and telling Vladdie, ‘Don't you leave me.’” ...\n\nOn Friday, June 13, players and team personnel enjoyed an outing with the Cup at the Orchards Golf Club in northern Macomb County. Rides had been arranged so that no one would have to worry how many times they had sipped from the Cup.\n\nThe stretch limousine was traveling south on Woodward Avenue in Birmingham when it veered across three lanes and crashed into a maple tree. Fetisov was hurled forward but his trajectory was halted by the mini fridge. He suffered a chest injury and a bruised lung and was released from the hospital after five days.\n\nKonstantinov and Mnatsakanov were tossed into the minibar, shards of glass embedding in their heads. Konstantinov suffered what doctors called “scrambled brain,” a condition that can shear neurons and cause swelling. Mnatsakanov was thrown so violently that he suffered a fractured skull and broken spine. Brain matter leaked out of fissures. Both were comatose.\n\nIrina Konstantinov found out about the accident from Fetisov’s wife, Lada. Elena Mnatsakanov, Sergei’s wife, was returning from walking the family dog when she saw a strange car in their driveway. A team official was waiting for her.\n\nBack at the golf club, cell phones started ringing.\n\n“To this day I remember that night,” Kirk Maltby said in 2019. “We had no idea how bad it was at first. We thought, ‘OK, they’re at the hospital, they’re getting treatment.’ We thought it was broken bones, something like that. Like, they could rehab and that would be that.”\n\nTHE DAY BEFORE: The story of Steve Yzerman's iconic toothless grin with Stanley Cup\n\nSome players headed to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, where the men had been rushed by ambulance. Others gathered at Chris Osgood’s home in Birmingham.\n\n“We just waited, which was the hardest part,” Maltby said. “We didn’t know it was going to be near as bad as it was. When we finally got word that in particular Vladdie was fighting for his life, it was a very nervous quiet. No one wanted to talk.”\n\nOver the coming days, fans set up vigils in front of the hospital. Reporters had cameras trained to catch visiting team personnel. Hospital staff had players and coaching staff enter through side entrances to minimize disruptions. The Stanley Cup was brought by stretcher beneath a sheet in an effort to bring cheer. ...\n\nThe accident left Mnatsakanov paralyzed in both legs and his left arm. He hadn’t suffered the extensive brain damage that impaired Konstantinov, and he remembered what life had been like before the accident. When Mnatsakanov and Konstantinov attended a playoff game in 1998, watching from the Ilitch family’s suite, Konstantinov gave cheering fans a thumbs-up. Mnatsakanov waved a pom-pom with his only fully functioning arm, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nGnida was released from the hospital June 15. Birmingham police initially said blood drawn from Gnida the night of the accident showed no evidence of drugs, but later amended that to say tests did show Gnida had traces of marijuana in his system. Police found a partially smoked marijuana cigarette under the driver’s seat.\n\nAuthorities theorized Gnida fell asleep at the wheel, causing the stretch limo to drift, jump the six-inch curb and hit the tree. That’s what Fetisov told friends: That he had shouted and pounded to get Gnida’s attention after noticing Gnida appeared unresponsive. Gnida told police he “blanked out.” Years later, he admitted he fell asleep.\n\nAfter a 15-week investigation, Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca said officials couldn’t tell what effect, if any, the marijuana had on Gnida’s driving. There was no evidence, Gorcyca decided, that Gnida was under the influence when the accident happened. However, the investigating officer, Dave Schultz, in “Broken Wings,” a book written with Free Press columnist Charlie Vincent, said he had experts who thought Gnida had smoked pot three to six hours before the crash.\n\nIn October 1997, Gnida admitted he knew his driver’s license was suspended when he made the decision to chauffeur the limousine. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor second offense of driving on a suspended license. In November, Gnida was sentenced to nine months in jail and 200 hours of community service. Outrage over the law that mandated such a light sentence prompted lawmakers to pass bills that would make it a felony to cause serious injury or death while driving on a suspended or revoked license. ...\n\nKonstantinov was 30 years old at the time of his accident, in the prime of his career. He had led the NHL with a plus-60 rating in 1996. He was a finalist for the Norris Trophy for the first time in 1997. He had a big, beautiful home in Orchard Lake Village, a swanky suburb northwest of Detroit. The best years of his life beckoned.\n\nJEFF SEIDEL IN 2019: Vladimir Konstantinov and his untold battle after fateful limo crash\n\nFew players endeared themselves so quickly to Wings fans — and drew the enmity of every other team’s fan base — as Konstantinov, a stoic defenseman from the far northwest of Russia. He started playing for the Wings in 1991 and earned the nicknames the Vladinator and Vlad the Impaler for his open-ice hits and unforgiving play. He skated with intensity and irritation every shift, even as he logged heavy minutes against key opposing players. ...\n\nAfter the limo accident, Konstantinov was in a coma for two months at Beaumont Hospital. He was removed from a ventilator in late June, after undergoing a tracheostomy to ensure he was receiving enough oxygen. Doctors did not declare him fully conscious until mid-August.\n\nKonstantinov should have been gearing up for training camp. Instead, he spent four hours a day working on balance and coordination.\n\nHe was released from the hospital in November so that he could continue rehabilitation in Florida, where the warmer climate would allow him to spend time outdoors. In January 1998, he joined his teammates for their visit to the White House.\n\n“You are showing every day that you have the heart of a champion,\" President Bill Clinton told him.\n\nThe family returned to Michigan in the spring and settled into a routine. Konstantinov spent eight hours a day undergoing physical, speech and occupational therapy. His brain was severely traumatized, but hard work? That was in Konstantinov’s DNA. ...\n\nKonstantinov’s presence during the 1997-98 season was everywhere his teammates were. They wore a patch on their sweaters with his and Mnatsakanov’s initials. Konstantinov’s gear hung in his locker, where Slava Kozlov had placed a smooth stone with the word “believe” written on it. An unknown woman had sent it Kozlov early in the 1997 playoffs, and he immediately went on a scoring binge. When the Wings won the Cup again in June 1998, teammates wheeled Konstantinov onto the ice at Washington’s MCI Center, put a championship hat on his head and gave him an unlit cigar. Yzerman placed the Cup in Konstantinov’s lap. Then they took him for a victory lap.\n\nA decade later, Konstantinov still required 24-hour assistance from a team of caregivers. Irina and their daughter, Anastasia, lived in Florida but visited regularly at the West Bloomfield condo Konstantinov called home.\n\nMORE ON VLADDIE: Vladimir Konstantinov's caregivers fear he could be forced into a nursing home\n\nThe wives of Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov filed a $290 million suit against Findlay Ford Lincoln Mercury, an Ohio car dealership, in 2004, alleging the limousine’s seat belts were inaccessible because they had been tucked under the seats. None of the passengers had been wearing one. The dealership had sold the Lincoln Town Car to Gambino’s, which was defunct by then.\n\nThe trial began in 2008. Witnesses included Wings legend Ted Lindsay, who, in vintage Lindsay form (he was 82 at the time) suggested Gnida deserved a bullet for his actions. “People like that should be shot,” Lindsay said. Yzerman testified that Konstantinov “could have played right up to now.” A federal jury rejected the suit, saying evidence did not prove the dealership was to blame. ...\n\nThe maple tree in Birmingham became a landmark in the days after the accident. Fans erected shrines made of jerseys, candles, flowers and other mementos. Police removed the tributes after several accidents stemming from drivers stopping or slowing down to see the display.\n\nA storm in early July 1997 caused substantial damage and prompted the city to cut the tree down, leaving a knobby stump in the grassy median. Eventually, that stump was removed, too.\n\nThe timeline: Key dates in the Wings’ battles with their injuries from their June 13, 1997, limousine accident:\n\n• June 18: Fetisov was released from the hospital.\n\n• June 19: Mnatsakanov had surgery to stabilize his spinal cord. He was still in a coma, and doctors were unsure whether he was paralyzed.\n\n• June 24: Konstantinov showed more consistent responses to his family and made purposeful movements.\n\n• June 29: Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov were upgraded from critical to serious condition. Konstantinov had been removed from a ventilator a day earlier.\n\n• July 7: Mnatsakanov regained consciousness and was able to write his name in Russian.\n\n• July 23: Konstantinov was out of his coma but not fully awake. He was upgraded to fair condition.\n\n• Aug. 21: Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov were upgraded to good condition, and doctors said Konstantinov was fully conscious, though not able to speak or write. Mnatsakanov spoke sentences in Russian and English.\n\n• Oct. 9: The Stanley Cup was taken to the hospital for a visit with Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov, hours before the Wings’ home opener and banner-raising ceremony. Mnatsakanov wanted to fill it with vodka; Konstantinov was able to find his name etched on the Cup.\n\n• Nov. 1: Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov, in wheelchairs, visited practice at Joe Louis Arena and shared tears and laughs with teammates. “We want them to feel like they can come down here anytime they want,” Wharton said, “and just be part of this team the way they always were and the way they always will be.”\n\n• Nov. 6: Doctors said Konstantinov had begun speaking — the names of his wife, Irina, and his daughter, Anastasia, and some Russian words.\n\n• Nov. 9: Konstantinov left Beaumont to continue his rehabilitation in Florida during the winter months. The day before, he and Mnatsakanov received their Stanley Cup rings in a ceremony with the rest of the team.\n\n• Dec. 2: Doctors said Mnatsakanov, paralyzed in both legs and his left arm, would be discharged to continue rehabilitation at his Grosse Pointe Woods home.\n\nThe letter: The Wings’ accident elicited an outpouring of support for Konstantinov, Mnatsakanov and Fetisov from around the world. “It is so touching, so emotional,” Fetisov said. “Every letter the people send me is from the heart. Especially from the kids; you can tell from their handwriting they are 6, 7, 8 years old. They send stuffed animals, usually bears, but sometimes other animals. Every letter is very special to me.” During the next season, Fetisov asked the Free Press to help him respond by publishing a letter to fans:\n\nHello:\n\nThis summer, my family, friends and I went through a very tragic experience.\n\nIt helped us recover faster knowing there were people like you out there praying for a speedy recovery. My family and I would personally like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all your warm wishes and get-well cards.\n\nIt meant so much to my wife, Ladlena, my daughter, Anastasia, and myself that you were praying for us. We could not believe all the boxes and boxes of warm get-well cards, pictures, children’s drawings, stuffed animals, guardian angel pins and so many other special things we received and are still receiving. It puts tears to our eyes when we read these touching letters. We never knew so many people really cared.\n\nWe received get-well wishes not only from Michigan, but from all over the United States, Russia, Canada and Europe. It is so nice to know that there are such loving and caring people in the world.\n\nI am sorry it took so long to thank everyone. I had hoped to answer each letter individually, but because of the overwhelming amount of mail I received, it is not humanly possible to do so. But I want each and every one of you to know how much it meant to my family and me. It was so thoughtful and a very special thing for you to do.\n\nIn Russia, we have a belief that when people think positive thoughts about someone, their vibes and prayers are sent to that person and help heal. I know if it wasn’t for all the support and love of my family, friends and fans, I would not be where I am today.\n\nMy great friends Vladimir and Sergei love all the mail they have received. Please continue to write to them and pray for them because this really helps them with their healing process.\n\nYour friend, Slava Fetisov\n\nPaying the price: First, Anaheim fired coach Ron Wilson after the Mighty Ducks were swept by the Wings in the Western Conference semifinals. Now, Philadelphia fired coach Terry Murray after the Flyers were swept by the Wings in the Stanley Cup Final. In Anaheim, management thought Wilson drew too much attention to himself. In Philadelphia, general manager Bob Clarke cited a rift between Murray and his players that was irreparable. Murray took plenty of heat from hockey pundits (and his players) for his decisions during the finals, from switching goalies from Ron Hextall to Garth Snow to Hextall; for his obsession to match lines with Wings coach Scotty Bowman; and for not giving sufficient ice time to his lethal Legion of Doom line featuring Eric Lindros. But Murray took his most heat from his players for saying the Flyers were “in a choking situation” after losing Game 3, 6-1. Clarke said he did not consult with players before his decision. “If you get beat four straight, the other team is better,” Clarke said. “The problems we have didn’t just surface. They’ve been here for the past couple of years.” Murray’s contract expired after the playoffs, but when the Flyers beat the Rangers in five games in the Eastern Conference finals, Clarke announced that Murray would be back next season “if he wants to be.” Murray immediately said he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. After the firing, Clarke declined to address the obviously frosty relationship between Murray and Lindros. But owner Ed Snider told the Philadelphia Inquirer: “I would agree they did not have a good relationship.”\n\nOff the ice: “OUR CUPS” blared the big headline atop the front of Sports section of the Free Press. “OUR PRAYERS” read a headline nearly as big in the middle of the page. On Monday the 16th, the Free Press dealt with the diametric emotions of the days following the limo accident. The reason for “OUR CUPS” was that the Detroit Vipers had just won the Turner Cup as champions of the International Hockey League. In fact, on the left side of the headline was a photo of the Stanley Cup and on the right side of headline was a photo of the Turner Cup. “Detroit waited 42 years to capture a cup,” St. James wrote. “Eight days later, it captured its second.” The Vipers beat the Long Beach Ice Dogs, 2-0, in Game 6 before a rowdy crowd of 15,035 at the Palace of Auburn Hills. In the beginning, there was a moment of silence for fans to pray for Konstantinov, Mnatsakanov and Fetisov before the national anthem. In the end, Vipers captain Stan Drulia lifted the Turner Cup high above his head and skated it around the ice. The reason for “OUR PRAYERS” was because of two columns, one by Vincent and one by Keith Gave. From Brooklyn, Michigan, Vincent wrote: “Where Vladimir Konstantinov lies today — in a room cold with fear — Ernie Irvan lay less than three years ago.” In August 1994, Irvan drove his NASCAR racer into a concrete wall at Michigan International Speedway at 180 miles an hour or so. He did not break a thing, but the inside of his skull was a mess. “My brain stopped faster than it can stop,” he once told Vincent. Konstantinov’s brain also suffered from rapid deceleration. Irvan wasn’t expected to survive, let alone race again. But on this Father’s Day, back at MIS, he won the Miller 400 Winston Cup race. His recovery, more than his victory, “offers hope to everybody in the world,” Irvan said. “It’s going to be really tough for the hockey player to come back, but if it’s in God’s mind, he will.” Gave wrote about Konstantinov, a man he knew well. A U.S. spy-turned-newsman, Gave had traveled to Russia a few years earlier to unravel the elaborate ruse — that Konstantinov had terminal cancer — the Wings helped orchestrate, with piles of bribe money, to spirit him from the Red Army to the Red Wings. Gave wrote: “He’s the one guy we never worried about. No matter what happened, no matter how hard he was hit and how bad his fall, Vladimir Konstantinov always, always got up to hit somebody a little harder. Suddenly, with our summer of joy turned into a vigil, he’s the one we worry about most. The Vladinator, Vald the Impaler, Vladimir the Terrible, Grandpa, Curious George — the guy who certainly leads the NHL in nicknames, all of them fitting and worthy — lay in a coma in a Royal Oak hospital, his Red Wings teammates and all of us devastated by the crash that ruined a wonderful celebration. And now rather than talk about the good times we all had only a week ago … we whisper about a tragedy that has cast a pall over our city. And we embrace the slightest bit of information, regardless of its accuracy, that suggests that Vladdie and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov are getting better. So it was Sunday, when doctors talked of Konstantinov, still comatose but responding to the voices of his family and team members. How it heartened us to learn they were playing his new favorite song — Queen’s ‘We Are the Champions’ — over at his bedside. We never worried about the Vladinator. Now we worry to death. … Now, more than ever, we should embrace a hockey marketing slogan and turn it into a prayer. “Get Up!!” Get up, Vladdie. You always do. Please, God. You too, Sergei, the masseur with the easy, friendly smile and healing hands. Get up. Then we’ll get on with enjoying the most wonderful summer of our lives. But only then.”\n\nFamous last words: Mitch Albom tried to make sense out of the limo accident, the pain and the suffering:\n\nIn dealing with hope, there is little anyone — myself included — can say to make things better. Prayer helps. So does perspective.\n\nSo remember this. The respirator that is helping Konstantinov breathe right now was hooked to someone else before him. The bed he occupies was once occupied by someone else as well. Those patients were all loved by someone. They were all the most important person in someone’s life — just as Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov are to their loved ones. And they all fought a lonely battle to live. It made no difference if they were famous. These things happen. They just happen.\n\nReal life doesn’t offer explanations. And so we wait, we check the newspapers and the radio and we try to go on with our lives. You wonder how we can absorb such disparate signals, how such a wonderful weekend can coexist with such a tragic weekend.\n\nThe answer, I believe, beats deep inside every one of us. The human heart is boundless, it makes room for all things, it puts a sunny day next to a critically injured athlete and prays the good will rub off on the bad. We pray along with it.\n\nRelive the glory: The Free Press has crafted a 208-page, full-color, hardcover collector’s book with fresh insights and dynamic storytelling about the 1996-97 Wings.

And though friends suggested he declare his allegiance to one team, he has reasons to like both.\n\n\"I grew up in Pittsburgh during the Paul Coffey era,\" Matthew said. \"With Paul Coffey being an assistant coach for the Edmonton Oilers -- he won four Stanley Cups with the Oilers in the 80s, and now he's behind the bench about to win his first Cup as a coach. I've met Paul Coffey at numerous Penguin alumni events, and this organization has been building for years.\"\n\nMatthew said he can't root for the Panthers because of the fierce rivalry with the Bolts.\n\n\"That would be like us in Pittsburgh rooting for the (Philadelphia) Flyers or the Cleveland Browns with the Cincinnati Bengals,\" he said. \"It just doesn't happen that way.\"\n\nThat pattern seems to have taken hold in the Tampa Bay area, where fans would much rather see the Panthers hanging out to dry than the Cup hoisted in their own state if it's the Panthers vying to do it.\n\n\"At the beginning, I didn’t know which team to root for,\" Lightning fan Michelle Gordon said. \"I like the idea of the Cup being in Florida -- and especially keeping it away from Canada for yet another year! But it’s the Panthers and they are our rivals, so I was torn. But now, the idea of our rivals going down in history as epic chokers? It’s just so beautiful, and it’s put me all in for Edmonton. Let’s go, Oilers.\"\n\nSome Tampa Bay fans have developed distaste for the way the Panthers play, calling their rivals \"dirty\" and \"arrogant.\"\n\nSome Lightning fans see the Panthers as 'bullies'\n\nLightning fan Kim Stoddard Halcyon-Clancy even went as far as to call the Panthers \" a team full of Bullies for years.\"\n\nLike some of her fellow fans, Lightning fan Martha Howes pulled no punches in expressing why she wants the Oilers to come out on top, including Panthers fans in her scrutiny.\n\n\"Can't root for your biggest division rival,\" she said. \"And on top of that, I think their fans are disrespectful, and they play dirty hockey. Let's go Edmonton.\"\n\nThough the Panthers may have the \"Florida\" tag, as opposed to most National Hockey League teams with names of cities, some Lightning fans see their team - which has won the Stanley Cup three times - as better representatives for being a go-to team in Florida.\n\n\"The Florida Kitty Cats play dirty; that's the reason I wouldn't root for them,\" said Lightning fan Kristin Maldonado. \"They always played dirty. Look, I like (goalie Sergei Bobrovsky) but don't like the whole team. I root for teams that play sensible and deserve to win. I am a Bolts fan through and through. The way I see it, Bolts are the team of the state of Florida.\"\n\nPerhaps some of the ire stems from the Panthers knocking the Lightning out of Stanley-Cup contention in the first round of the NHL playoffs this season.

Both teams have won more than 70% of their games during the playoffs and, as alluded to, have scored goals at will, albeit in much different ways. Edmonton has relied on unmatched star power to fill the net while Florida has taken a more balanced approach offensively, with its third line often making the difference.

She’s the spiky center of Cole Escola’s delightfully dumb new play “Oh, Mary!”, which opened July 11 at Broadway’s Lyceum Theatre after a sold-out run downtown, which drew megawatt fans such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Timothée Chalamet and Steven Spielberg.\n\nMary (Escola) is cloistered at home by husband Abraham (Conrad Ricamora), a cantankerously closeted gay man, who would rather she chug paint thinner than return to her one great love: cabaret. “How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?” he barks. (“How would it look?” Mary counters. “Sensational!”)\n\nBriskly directed by Sam Pinkleton and unfolding over 80 deliriously funny minutes, “Oh, Mary!” has only gotten sharper since its scrappy off-Broadway mounting last spring. A return visit magnifies the sensational work of the supporting players in Mary’s twisted melodrama: Bianca Leigh as her put-upon punching bag Louise, whose insatiable lust for ice cream leads to one of the play’s most uproarious one-liners; and James Scully as Mary’s dashing acting coach with undisclosed desires of his own.\n\nRicamora, the earnest heart of last season’s “Here Lies Love,” plays the president as a sort of venom-spewing Henny Youngman, whose contempt for Mary is surpassed only by his carnal longing for Simon (Tony Macht), his sheepish assistant. By the time Abe makes his fateful trip to Ford’s Theatre, the entire audience is gleefully cheering against him.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nBut none wrest the spotlight from Escola, who, at the risk of hyperbole, gives one of the greatest comedic performances of the century so far. Watching them is akin to witnessing Nathan Lane in “The Producers,” Beth Leavel in “The Drowsy Chaperone” or Michael Jeter in “Grand Hotel” – a tour de force so singularly strange, and so vivaciously embodied, that it feels like an event.\n\nEscola, a nonbinary actor best known for Hulu's “Difficult People” and truTV's “At Home with Amy Sedaris,” brings darting eyes and outrageous physicality to the role. Their petulant Mary is like Joan Crawford on horse tranquilizers: one moment pouting and glaring from the corner of the Oval Office; the next, firing off filthy zingers as they tumble and barrel across the room, sniffing out hidden liquor bottles like a snockered Bugs Bunny. Mary is illiterate, delusional and somehow oblivious to the entire Civil War. (When Abe laments that the entire South hates him, Mary asks dumbfounded, “The south of what?”)\n\nBut in all the character’s feverish mania, Escola still manages to find moments of genuine pathos as Mary resigns herself to no more “great days,” settling instead for “a lifetime of steady, just fine” ones. There’s a childlike desperation and need for attention that makes the ribald first lady ultimately rootable. And when she does finally showcase her madcap medleys – styled in Holly Pierson’s sublime costumes and Leah J. Loukas’ instantly iconic wig – it’s transcendent.\n\nMoving to Broadway after months of breathless hype from critics and theatergoers, it would be easy to turn up one’s nose at the show, grumbling that something was “lost” in the transfer. But that is certainly not the case here: For any fans of “elegant stories told through song,” Escola’s brilliant lunacy is the real deal.

The views expressed here are solely the author’s own. View more opinion articles on CNN\n\nCNN —\n\nPlease note: Spoilers follow for the season finale of “Somebody Somewhere.”\n\nThe best new show about middle America stars New York City’s raunchiest cabaret singer. Anyone have that on your cultural-weirdness bingo card?\n\nBridget Everett is the lead in HBO’s “Somebody Somewhere,” which concluded its short first season Sunday night. Everett plays Sam, a middle-aged woman who’s moved back to her Kansas hometown, Manhattan, to care for her dying sister. (HBO and CNN share a parent company.)\n\nWe meet Sam in the aftermath, sleeping on her late sister’s couch and unsure what to do with the rest of her life. She’s been working a mind-numbing job as a standardized test grader while trying to help keep various family members afloat, including her other, tightly-wound sister (Mary Catherine Garrison), whose husband is cheating, and their alcoholic mother (Jane Brody).\n\nDrifting along with a sort of affable frustration, Sam (who seems to be straight) discovers a community in a queer cabaret called Choir Practice, held in a mall church, where she reignites a long-buried desire to be a singer.\n\nIt’s been fascinating to watch Everett emerge onto the mainstream radar. She’s been known to a subset of New Yorkers for many years as one of the city’s best and bawdiest cabaret performers (the most PG-rated of her well-known songs is “T**ties”). As a recent profile put it, “traditionally, she ends the show by picking a man out of the crowd and sitting on his face.”\n\nShe’s appeared sporadically on the big and small screen, but except for the failed Amazon Prime pilot “Love You More” in 2017, never as the lead. Here, the show is structured around an alternative version of Everett, who’s actually from the “Little Apple” in real life. It asks: What would have happened if you’d ended up staying here?\n\nThe show was produced by the Duplass brothers, who have a solid track record of humane portraits of real people (their earlier HBO show “Togetherness,” 2014’s “The Skeleton Twins”).\n\nCourtesy HBO\n\n“Somebody Somewhere” visits familiar locations in the average-American-town pantheon. There’s a fluorescent-lit office building, a knickknack shop, the local fast-food drive-thru – but the show resists populating them with goofball characters. Sam’s sister runs that shop, and while the camera may linger winkingly on her positive-slogan throw pillows, it also shows her working late into the night hand-sewing sachets for a store event. Their dad is a farm guy, but he’s not a hayseed – the show’s careful to depict the business as a lot of hard work and worry.\n\nIt’s not as if the plot about going back to your hometown is exactly novel. But “Somebody Somewhere” never exudes the kind of urban superiority you often see in movies and shows about small towns and city folk trapped in them – nor does it offer lessons, a la every Hallmark Christmas movie, about the redemption that lies in Americana values. Typically, the latter involves a work-obsessed woman discovering the real secret to happiness is quitting your high-powered job, trading your tailored suits for flannels and jeans, and marrying a square-jawed (usually White) man who never left his monoculture, Christmas-obsessed small town.\n\nWith her T-shirt-centric wardrobe and penchant for wine-drunk Sundays, Everett’s Sam belongs to an expanding class of female-schlub leads. Her predecessors include the stoner women of “Broad City,” Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s fourth-wall-breaking “Fleabag,” and Lena Dunham’s narcissistic exhibitionist on “Girls.”\n\nAt some point, all of those women go home again, too. But in a novel development, Sam’s not completely at odds with her Midwestern hometown surroundings. One of the most surprising things about “Somebody Somewhere” is just how gentle it is, especially compared to Everett’s bawdy, in-your-face style.\n\nYou might expect that, given her New York persona, she’d play someone who’s too much for vanilla America. Instead, she meets this Manhattan where it is. She’s a brilliant, subtle performer, her character maintaining a fundamental self-confidence and comfortability even as she marinates in confusion about what, exactly, she wants.\n\nAs good as Everett is, Jeff Hiller nearly steals the show from her as the lovely Joel, a co-worker who was once a classmate of Sam’s. He’s an out gay man who’s also a Christian, and such a pillar of the community he does a yearly blessing of the community’s pets. He doesn’t yearn to leave the confines of this Manhattan. He likes it there (though his vision board includes a trip to Paris) and he sees the good in the people around him.\n\nLike Everett, Hiller has spoken about his own roots in red America, telling Vulture, “I had the choice to stay in Texas and be a part of a faith community. I even found one that accepted queer folks and was a really nice place to be. The show feels exactly like that, except I wouldn’t be the person creating the community.”\n\nThe show also features comedian Murray Hill, another beloved New York cabaret personality, as Fred Rococo, a soil-science professor and the emcee of Choir Practice. And Mike Hagerty, a character actor who’s been a staple in comedies for decades, gets one of his best-ever roles as Sam’s dad. Hagerty is often called upon to play a kind of central-casting blue-collar guy, but here he blossoms as a man trying to keep a struggling farm afloat and his beloved wife from falling apart under the weight of subsumed grief and alcoholism.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe show’s been renewed for a second season, with Everett and creators Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen saying they’d love to see it run for 10 or more. Bos, who’s from Evanston, IL, has said she and Thureen kept non-condescension in mind: “I see a lot of stories about the Midwest that are making fun of the Midwest, or there’s a hokey-ness or quirkiness. We wanted to make it as grounded as possible, not making fun of the characters.”\n\nAs someone with Midwestern roots – I’ve got family from Manhattan, Kansas, too – I find Everett’s show revolutionary in a very generous way. It’s a nuanced, lived-in portrayal of a community, and even in the glut of TV offerings today, that’s still fairly rare. (Hulu’s “Reservation Dogs” offers a similarly big-hearted rendition of a very different locale, a Native American community in Oklahoma, though without the outsider angle.)\n\nIt’s hard to go a day without hearing about our culture war, about the trend of people moving to be closer to people aligned with similar values, and the chasm between small-town and city people. We tend to favor an easy shorthand narrative, especially in media depictions, about urban populations as fundamentally progressive and rural ones as wall-to-wall conservative.\n\n“Somebody Somewhere” opts to, more interestingly, dwell in the gray areas, maintaining, rightly, there are all types of people nearly everywhere. I’m sure there are red-state Americans who wouldn’t be on board with the wide variety of characters portrayed here, but it’s heartening to think there might be more room in the middle than we think – a bridge, as Everett has shown, between the two Manhattans.", "authors": ["Sara Stewart"], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/12/18/best-broadway-shows-2024/77017200007/", "title": "Broadway's 10 best shows of 2024, including 'Oh, Mary!'", "text": "NEW YORK — Theater fans have plenty to be grateful for this holiday season.\n\nOver these last 12 months, we’ve been gifted incredible performances from Daniel Dae Kim (“Yellow Face”), Michael Urie (“Once Upon a Mattress”), Jessica Hecht (“Eureka Day”) and Laura Donnelly (“The Hills of California”). Off-Broadway, we were hit with a two-ton joy bomb in the form of “Cats: The Jellicle Ball,” which transported Andrew Lloyd Webber’s divisive musical from the junkyard to the queer ballroom scene. And up on 45th Street, Danya Taymor minted her status as a visionary director with Tony Award-winning best musical “The Outsiders,” which she elevated well beyond its young-adult origins.\n\nHere's what else we loved on Broadway this past year:\n\n10. 'Cult of Love'\n\nZachary Quinto and Barbie Ferreira star in a new play about a volatile family reunion where secrets are laid bare. It’s an age-old theater trope, but few recent playwrights have mined the subject with such razor-sharp insight as Leslye Headland (“Russian Doll”), who achingly captures why we keep coming back to the people who hurt us most. Rebecca Henderson and Roberta Colindrez are riveting standouts as the brood’s sensible black sheep, who become targets of Shailene Woodley’s homophobic Jesus freak.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nNow playing at the Hayes Theater through Feb. 2.\n\n9. 'The Heart of Rock and Roll'\n\nA year ago, we never could’ve guessed that a Huey Lewis jukebox musical would one day rank among our very best of Broadway. And yet, we firmly believe this short-lived show deserved to be a “Mamma Mia!”-sized hit, with its ingenious staging and clever story set at a three-day packing supplies conference. In a just world, McKenzie Kurtz would’ve coasted to a Tony nod on the sheer power of her “It Hit Me Like a Hammer.”\n\nClosed at the James Earl Jones Theatre on June 23.\n\n8. 'Death Becomes Her'\n\nMost screen-to-stage musicals are stubbornly beholden to their source material. But in adapting “Death Becomes Her,” writer Marco Pennette (“Ugly Betty”) both honors the 1992 film and creates his own weird, raunchy, campy send-up of society’s insatiable beauty obsession. Jennifer Simard and Megan Hilty are deliciously demented as begrudging best friends-turned-youth-starved nemeses, and the show’s body-bending illusions are theatrical magic at its best.\n\nNow playing at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.\n\n7. 'An Enemy of the People'\n\nJeremy Strong earned a best actor Tony for his simmering turn as a 19th-century physician, whose warnings of impending environmental disaster fall on deaf ears. Although Henrik Ibsen’s drama is more than a century old, its themes of distrust and misinformation are scarily timely, and Sam Gold’s immersive direction brilliantly plunged the audience into the heart of the action.\n\nClosed at the Circle in the Square Theatre on June 23.\n\n6. 'Sunset Boulevard'\n\nAs gay men, we have but simple needs, and those include a former Pussycat Doll belting Andrew Lloyd Webber ballads. Not everything works in Jamie Lloyd’s stripped-down, video-heavy revival, but the risks it takes are ultimately far more exciting than most of what’s on Broadway right now. Nicole Scherzinger, too, is undeniable, bringing astounding vocals and haunting desperation to vampiric Hollywood has-been Norma Desmond.\n\nNow playing at the St. James Theatre.\n\n5. 'Mary Jane'\n\nRachel McAdams made one of the best stage debuts in recent memory in Amy Herzog’s harrowing “Mary Jane,” about a single mom trying to care for her sick child. The Oscar nominee brought disarming wit and naturalism to the resilient character, who grasps for optimism in the most hopeless of circumstances. But Herzog’s perceptive writing skirts easy sentimentality, with a profoundly ambiguous ending that we’re still discussing months later.\n\nClosed at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on June 30.\n\n4. 'Illinoise'\n\nBroadway is a lot less vibrant without Justin Peck’s miraculous dance musical, which used Sufjan Stevens songs to weave a gorgeous yarn about (quite literally) moving through heartbreak and grief. Ricky Ubeda deserved every award imaginable for his silently shattering work, and we’ll never shut up about watching Rachel Lockhart and Byron Tittle cast a spell with their dizzying footwork in “Jacksonville.”\n\nClosed at the St. James Theatre on Aug. 10.\n\n3. 'Gypsy'\n\nAs of press time, there’s not a whole lot we can share about “Gypsy,” which officially opens Dec. 19 at the Majestic Theatre (the former longtime home of “The Phantom of the Opera”). That said, Audra McDonald is a force of nature as the fiercely protective Mama Rose, in a blazing revival that breathes new life into the classic showbiz musical. Hers is perhaps the first “Rose’s Turn” to bring us helplessly to tears.\n\nNow playing at the Majestic Theatre.\n\n2. 'Maybe Happy Ending'\n\nCritics have rightly championed “Maybe Happy Ending” for being the scarcest of Broadway treasures: an entirely original new musical. But more than just inventive, it’s also really damn good. Darren Criss and Helen J Shen are luminous as a pair of star-crossed androids who fall in love on the cusp of their expiration dates. Brimming with humor and heart-tugging emotion, this wise and wistful masterpiece is also one of the most visually stunning shows to hit New York in ages.\n\nNow playing at the Belasco Theatre.\n\n1. 'Oh, Mary!'\n\nWith her short legs and long medleys, crazed first lady Mary Todd Lincoln has become an improbable pop-culture sensation, thanks to the deranged genius of playwright/actor Cole Escola. The airtight, 80-minute comedy imagines Lincoln as a petulant shut-in who chugs paint thinner and dreams of stardom when she’s not quarreling with her closet case husband (Conrad Ricamora). Wildly irreverent, oddly touching and unabashedly gay, “Oh, Mary!” is the rare Broadway outing to exceed its deafening hype. Like a big scoop of vanilla ice cream that falls into your lap, it’s sensational.\n\nNow playing at the Lyceum Theatre through June 28.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2025/06/09/tony-awards-2025-highlights/84038988007/", "title": "Tony Awards 2025: 'Hamilton' reunion, Audra McDonald steal the ...", "text": "NEW YORK – Broadway has fallen head over heels with a pair of androids.\n\n\"Maybe Happy Ending,\" a heart-tugging romantic dramedy about helper robots in near-future South Korea, was the big winner at the Tony Awards June 8, taking home six prizes including best musical, best director (Michael Arden), and best actor (Darren Criss). The fiercely original show opened to glowing reviews and meager box office last fall, but it has gradually become one of the hottest tickets in New York – a rare word-of-mouth success story in the ultra-competitive Broadway landscape.\n\nThis year's ceremony saw the vibrant Afro-Cuban musical \"Buena Vista Social Club\" and Netflix prequel play \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" scoop up multiple trophies apiece. Kara Young (\"Purpose\"), Francis Jue (\"Yellow Face\") and lifetime achievement award honoree Harvey Fierstein delivered some of the night’s most stirring speeches, while the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Purpose\" beat out hit satire “Oh, Mary!\" for best play.\n\nHere are more of the biggest moments from this year's star-studded festivities:\n\nTonys host Cynthia Erivo 'holds space' with Oprah Winfrey in opening number\n\nAt the top of the telecast, first-time host Erivo playfully shot down a bevy of suggestions about how to add pizzazz to her opening number. (Blast George Clooney out of a human cannon? Hard pass.)\n\nThe \"Color Purple\" powerhouse then ran into Winfrey in the wings, asking her, \"What do you do when everyone is telling you what you need to do?\" Winfrey dispensed her wisdom, saying: \"Forget about them, babe. The only thing you need to do is be yourself.\" Grinning, Erivo proceeded to grab Winfrey's finger – re-creating her viral \"holding space\" meme with \"Wicked\" co-star Ariana Grande from last fall.\n\n\"There's no place like home,\" Erivo said onstage, in one of her many nods to \"Wicked\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" throughout the night. \"And Broadway has always been mine.\"\n\nFrom the stage to the screen: Sign up for USA TODAY's Entertainment newsletter.\n\nSarah Snook says 'Succession' group chat has lit up since her Tony win\n\nSnook, who's best known to HBO fans as Shiv Roy on \"Succession,\" received her first Tony Award for best leading actress in a play for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" giving a marathon performance as 26 different characters in the one-person show.\n\nSeveral \"Succession\" alums have graced Broadway this past year, including Jeremy Strong (\"The Enemy of the People\"), Kieran Culkin (\"Glengarry Glen Ross\"), Juliana Canfield (\"Stereophonic\") and Molly Griggs (\"John Proctor is the Villain\").\n\n\"We haven't done much flaunting of awards in photos, but it's such a special group chat,\" Snook told reporters backstage. \"It’s a really special group of people, and we're all theater nerds deep down.\"\n\nLast spring, Cate Blanchett's production company Dirty Films acquired movie rights to bring \"Dorian Gray\" to the big screen. Snook said she hasn't yet heard anything about the potential adaptation, although she would be open to reprising her roles.\n\n\"I don’t know how this gets turned into a film,\" Snook said. \"It’s a particularly complex piece to do as a theater show. Dramaturgically, it holds up, and I think Kip (Williams) would be an incredible director for that project. If I got to be a part of that, that would be a dream come true.\"\n\nNicole Scherzinger, Audra McDonald, 'Hamilton' reunion hit Tony performance highs\n\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of \"Hamilton,\" Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr. and the original Broadway cast took the stage for an electrifying medley of the most beloved songs from the groundbreaking hip-hop musical, including \"My Shot,\" \"The Schuyler Sisters,\" \"You’ll Be Back\" and \"The Room Where It Happens.\" McDonald also brought the audience to its feet with her ferociously emotional rendition of \"Rose's Turn\" from \"Gypsy.\"\n\nEarlier in the night, \"Sunset Boulevard\" leading lady Scherzinger took our breath away with her stunning take on \"As If We Never Said Goodbye,\" introduced by the show's original Broadway star, Glenn Close.\n\nScherzinger went on to clinch the Tony for best leading actress in a musical in what was considered a neck-and-neck race with McDonald. “Growing up, I always felt like I didn’t belong,” the former Pussycat Dolls singer said through tears. “But you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home, at last.”\n\n'Maybe Happy Ending' star Darren Criss dedicates Tony Award to his wife and kids\n\nIn another of the tightest races of the evening, Criss garnered best leading actor in a musical for \"Maybe Happy Ending,\" trouncing formidable contenders Jonathan Groff (\"Just in Time\") and Tom Francis (\"Sunset Boulevard\"). The \"Glee\" charmer elatedly thanked his spouse for helping raise their two children amid his demanding schedule.\n\n\"The real hero … is my wife, Mia, who took a massive swing on allowing me to do this and to allow this crazy upheaval in our life to make this logistically possible,\" Criss said.\n\n\"And for bearing the brunt of raising two tiny friends under 3 so that I could raise a singing robot at the Belasco Theatre eight times a week. Mia, you're the very pedestal that upholds the shiny, spinny bit in our lives, and your love and your support for me and our beautiful children – combined with the miracle of working on something as magical as ‘Maybe Happy Ending’ – has been, and will always be, award enough.\"\n\nCole Escola thanks Grindr hookup in historic win for nonbinary performers\n\nCole Escola, the deranged genius behind \"Oh, Mary!\", won best leading actor in a play for their inspired turn as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln. They’re now the first nonbinary performer to win in that Tony category.\n\nChanneling Bernadette Peters in an off-the-shoulder Wiederhoeft gown, Escola feverishly sprinted to the stage and thanked fellow best actor nominees including George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim.\n\nCole Escola makes Tony Awards history as first nonbinary best leading actor in a play\n\n\"It's an honor to be in your company,\" Escola said. \"It's been a sincere pleasure spending time with you over these warm salads at all these (Tony) luncheons.\" They continued to thank their mom and their \"whole gang\" of friends: \"Oh, and Tebow from Grindr and Amy Sedaris, who always reminds me how important she is to me. And she is.\"\n\nWritten by Escola, \"Oh, Mary!\" imagines Lincoln as an alcoholic wannabe cabaret star and her husband, Abraham (Conrad Ricamora), as a closeted, temperamental commander-in-chief. Asked by reporters whether they would consider an Eleanor Roosevelt comedy next, Escola joked that she is \"played out. It would have to be something original, not another historical figure.\"\n\nThe singular playwright had some choice four-letter words for people who refuse to take chances on queer art; later, they sardonically compared the best actress showdown to a presidential election. (“Four more years!” they deadpanned when Scherzinger won.) But Escola had earnest moments, too, as they looked back at the unlikely phenomenon around “Oh, Mary!”\n\n“Trust that voice that says, ‘I think I’m right actually,’” Escola said. “It might take 12 years to put the pen to paper, but that voice is right.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/theater/2025/05/01/tony-nominees-2025-see-the-list-in-every-category/83385872007/", "title": "Best Broadway musical?

More surprisingly, David Hyde Pierce and Jinkx Monsoon were both overlooked for their hilarious turns in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" as was Helen J. Shen for playing an outdated robot in the tear-jerking \"Maybe Happy Ending.\"\n\n\"Maybe Happy Ending,\" \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"Buena Vista Social Club\" led the nominations with 10 nods a piece, including best musical. The strange-but-true \"Dead Outlaw\" and World War II spy satire \"Operation Mincemeat\" rounded out the best musical category.\n\nAs expected, Cole Escola's madcap \"Oh, Mary!\" was a major force with five nods, including best play, best actor (Escola) and best featured actor (Conrad Ricamora). The unlikely hit comedy, which tells a deranged alternative history of Mary Todd Lincoln, has attracted high-profile celebrity audience members including Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez, Meryl Streep, and Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe other nominees for best play were \"The Hills of California,\" \"English,\" \"Purpose,\" and \"John Proctor is the Villain.\" Notably missing from the category was \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" Netflix's high-budget yet critically divisive prequel to the sci-fi streaming sensation. Although, the theatrical spectacle still made off with five nominations, including best actor for newcomer Louis McCartney.\n\n\"Succession\" star Sarah Snook earned her first Tony nomination for her one-woman tour de force in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" as did former Pussycat Dolls frontwoman Nicole Scherzinger for her bewitching performance as fading film star Norma Desmond in \"Sunset Boulevard,\" an audacious revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical.\n\nA-listers George Clooney (\"Good Night, and Good Luck\"), Sadie Sink (\"John Proctor is the Villain\"), Mia Farrow (\"The Roommate\"), and Bob Odenkirk (\"Glengarry Glen Ross\") all garnered their first Tony nods as well.\n\nIn addition, Audra McDonald looks to extend her record as the most Tony-winning performer in history. The Broadway legend, who has won six Tony Awards, is vying for her seventh trophy with a best actress nomination for the classic showbiz musical \"Gypsy.\"\n\nHow to watch Tony Awards\n\nThe 78th annual Tony Awards will air live on Sunday, June 8, from New York's Radio City Music Hall (8 ET/5 PT on CBS and streaming on Paramount+).
