She is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nCNN —\n\nInfants and toddlers should be screened more for developmental delays, according to updated US guidelines released last week.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics updated the checklists of developmental milestones used to monitor infant and young children’s development in an effort to give parents and pediatricians clearer benchmarks that will make it easier to identify developmental delays early.\n\nA group made up of eight experts in different areas of child development reviewed and updated the checklists, which are used around the country, for the first time since their 2004 release as part of the CDC’s developmental surveillance campaign, “Learn the Signs. Act Early.”\n\nThe checklists, familiar to many parents as part of regular checkups at the pediatrician’s office, previously used 50th percentile milestones, meaning only half of children were expected to achieve the milestone at a given age. The revised checklists will now inquire about milestones 75% or more of children can be expected to achieve at a given age, eliminating unnecessary confusion and alarm while ensuring children who need additional evaluation and resources are properly identified.\n\n“The earlier a child is identified with a developmental delay the better, as treatment as well as learning interventions can begin,” said Dr. Paul H. Lipkin, a member of the AAP Section on Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics and Council on Children with Disabilities, who assisted with the revisions, in a news release.\n\n“At the same time, we don’t want to cause unnecessary confusion for families or professionals. Revising the guidelines with expertise and data from clinicians in the field accomplishes these goals,” Lipkin said.\n\nAdditional changes to the guidelines include the following:\n\n• Adding checklists for children at ages 15 and 30 months so that there is now a checklist for every checkup visit from 2 months to 5 years of age\n\n• Identifying additional social and emotional milestones children should meet (including smiling on their own to get your attention at 4 months old)\n\n• Removing vague language like “may” or “begins” when referring to certain milestones\n\n• Removing duplicate milestones\n\n• Providing new, open-ended questions to use in discussions between parents and pediatricians. One example: Is there anything that your child does or does not do that concerns you?\n\n• Revising and expanding tips and activities to promote kids’ development\n\nThe CDC’s free Milestone Tracker App incorporates the checklists with the aim of helping parents track developments in the play, learning, speaking and movement of children up to 5 years old. The app alerts parents to missed milestones with a prompt to talk to their pediatrician about any concerns.\n\nChild development expert Dr. Jenny Radesky said, while she’s pleased to see the changes, parents should keep in mind that milestones are not everything.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“They are ways that we try to figure out which children might have a developmental delay,” said Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, via email.\n\nParents should also trust their own knowledge about their kids, Radesky added, including what brings them joy, what overstimulates them, and when parents feel most connected to their children. “These aspects of parent-child relationship are not measured through milestones, but are crucial to children’s mental wellbeing,” she said.", "authors": ["Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/health/coffee-children-wellness/index.html", "title": "It's not OK to let kids drink coffee — so why do we do it? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWe have become a coffee-crazed culture. Yet with all the studies coming out on how a cup of joe can reduce the risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, dementia and some cancers, what’s the harm?\n\nIt’s even trickled down to children.\n\nDespite years of warnings from pediatricians and other health professionals that coffee and other caffeinated beverages such as sodas and sports drinks can be harmful to youth, parents are allowing their little ones — even toddlers — to drink those beverages.\n\nA 2015 study of Boston moms found that 14% of those surveyed allowed their 2-year-olds to drink between 1 and 4 ounces of coffee a day (a half a cup of coffee is 4 ounces). The study also found that 2.5% of moms gave coffee to their 1-year-olds.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no caffeinated coffee, tea, soda, sports drinks or other products for children under 12, while adolescents between 12 and 18 should limit their intake to less than 100 milligrams per day — about the size of an old-fashioned cup of coffee. A 16-ounce “grande” of Starbucks popular Blonde Roast coffee contains 360 milligrams, while the same size of its Pike Place Roast is 310 milligrams.\n\nCoffee comes in all sorts of sizes, flavors and levels of caffeine. Adobe Stock\n\nIt’s not just coffee. A bottle of sports drink can contain nearly 250 milligrams of caffeine depending on the brand, according to a Consumer Reports investigation. A cup of tea can have up to 47 milligrams, while a diet soda can have 46.\n\nChocolate has some caffeine, too, with the amount rising as the chocolate darkens in color. A handful of chocolate-covered coffee beans can have 336 milligrams of caffeine, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nYou can even buy caffeine chewing gum, mints, gummy bears and energy bars — and let’s not forget coffee ice cream.\n\nWhat age can you drink coffee?\n\nBecause children are usually smaller in body size, it takes less caffeine to impair their functioning. An insignificant amount for an adult could be overwhelming for a small child. Too much caffeine can raise heart rates and blood pressure, contribute to acid reflux, and cause anxiety and sleep disturbances in children. In high doses, caffeine can be dangerous.\n\n“Kids show up in the emergency room with irregular heartbeat or what we call tachycardia or rapid heartbeat,” said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins. “Some people think it’s cool to give toddlers a soda pop.”\n\nThe limits are based mostly based on body size, and those limits increase when a child has grown large enough to metabolize caffeine more readily. However, if children are small for their age, or have migraines, heart problems or seizures, they may be even more sensitive, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nWith all this bad news, why are parents letting kids drink coffee?\n\nIt starts when small children begin to ask for caffeinated drinks such as coffee “because they see the parents and older siblings drinking it — it’s a ‘grown-up’ thing to drink,” said Corkins, division chief of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, via email.\n\nAnd because parents perceive it as harmless — and it likely is in tiny amounts — they will let their children take a sip or two, Corkins said. “However, once the parents start, it becomes a slippery slope and easier to let the kids drink what they want than fight with them.”\n\nCoffee toppings and add-ons can affect nutrition\n\nThere’s another issue: the impact of coffee, tea, soda and sports drinks on a balanced diet.\n\n“My other problem with kids drinking coffee is that it’s of little nutritional value, and it’s replacing something that should be nutritionally complete, such as milk and water,” Corkins said. “Milk is packed with calcium and vitamin D, and water is a nutrient. We’re like 60% water, basically an ocean.”\n\nThen there are the add-ons. Gone are the days when coffee simply came with a lump of sugar and cream. Coffee shops on nearly every corner now offer dozens of ways to spice and fatten up your drink of choice.\n\n“These drinks are basically a dessert,” Corkins said. “They have the foam and the shots of flavored syrups, with whipped topping and then the sprinkles on top. Presentation is better than some of the desserts I’ve seen.”\n\nExtra sugars and heavy creams add fat and calories, while sugar-free versions can expose a children to artificial sweeteners.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line? “Avoid caffeine! Why do your kids need it?” Corkins said.\n\n“Caffeine is a stimulant that increases alertness. If your child feels like he or she needs caffeine to get through the day, it would be better to work with a pediatrician to identify the root cause of what is creating the fatigue in the first place.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/03/spanking-children-scotland-parliament-set-ban-hitting-kids/3849869002/", "title": "Spanking children: Scotland Parliament bans hitting kids", "text": "Scotland on Thursday became the first country in the United Kingdom to outlaw spanking and other physical punishment for children.\n\nThe bill will \"give children the same legal protection from assault that adults currently enjoy,\" says John Finnie, a member of the Scottish Parliament who introduced the bill.\n\nThe bill passed by 84 votes to 29.\n\nAt least 57 other countries already ban child corporal punishment, with Sweden becoming the first to do so, in 1979, according to the BBC.\n\nAdults and caregivers before could use \"reasonable\" physical force as punishment, the British broadcaster reported.\n\nNeed a break?

Most adults who catch it have a mild illness; for those who are elderly or who have chronic heart or lung disease or a weakened immune system, it can be dangerous. But RSV can be especially tricky for infants and kids.\n\nMora, a volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association, says it’s important for parents, caregivers and daycare workers to know what to watch for with RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus. That way, they know whether a sick child can be treated at home or needs to go to a hospital.\n\n“The emergency department is getting completely flooded with all these sick kids, so we want parents to know they can go to their pediatrician and get tested for RSV, influenza and even Covid-19,” Mora said.\n\nHere’s what else parents need to know amid the surge of respiratory illnesses.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nFor many, RSV causes a mild illness that can be managed at home.\n\nOn average, an infection lasts five days to a couple of weeks, and it will often go away on its own, the CDC says. Sometimes, the cough can linger for up to four weeks, pediatricians say.\n\nSymptoms may look like a common cold: a runny nose, a decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. Young infants may seem only irritable or lethargic and have trouble breathing.\n\nNot every child will have every potential RSV symptom.\n\n“Fevers are really hit or miss with RSV infections, especially in young infants,” said Dr. Priya Soni, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.\n\nParents should watch for any changes in behavior, she said, including taking longer to eat or not being interested in food at all. The child can also develop a severe cough and some wheezing.\n\nIt’s also important to watch for signs that your child is struggling to breathe or breathing with their ribs or belly – “symptoms which may kind of overlap with many of the other viruses that we’re seeing a resurgence of,” Soni added.\n\nSince it’s not easy for parents to tell the difference between respiratory illnesses like, say, RSV and flu, it’s good to take a sick child to a pediatrician, who can run tests to pinpoint the cause.\n\n“You may need to take your baby to be evaluated sooner rather than later,” Soni said.\n\nWhen it comes to RSV, parents should be especially cautious if their children are preemies, newborns, children with weakened immune systems or neuromuscular disorders, and those under age 2 with chronic lung and heart conditions, the CDC says.\n\n“Parents should be really astute to any changes, like in their activity and their appetite, and then pay particular attention to any signs of respiratory distress,” Soni said.\n\nRSV treatment\n\nTesting is important because treatment for things like flu and Covid-19 may differ.\n\nThere’s no antiviral or specific treatment for RSV like there is for the flu, nor is there a vaccine. But if your child is sick, there are things you can do to help.\n\nFever and pain can be managed with non-aspirin pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Also make sure your child drinks enough fluids.\n\n“RSV can make kids very dehydrated, especially when they’re not eating or drinking, especially when we’re talking infants,” Mora said. “Once they stop eating or their urine output has decreased, they’re not having as many wet diapers, this is a sign they may have to go to the pediatrician or emergency department.”\n\nTalk to your pediatrician before giving your child any over-the-counter cold medicines, which can sometimes contain ingredients that aren’t good for kids.\n\nWhen to go to the hospital\n\nYour pediatrician will check the child’s respiratory rate – how fast they’re breathing – and their oxygen levels. If your child is very sick or at high risk of severe illness, the doctor may want them to go to a hospital.\n\n“RSV can be super dangerous for some young infants and younger kids, particularly those that are less than 2 years of age,” Soni said.\n\nMora said labored breathing is a sign that a child is having trouble with this virus. RSV can turn into more serious illnesses such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, and that can lead to respiratory failure.\n\nIf you see that a child’s chest is moving up and down when they breathe, if their cough won’t let them sleep or if it’s getting worse, “that might be a sign that they need to seek help from their pediatrician or take them to the emergency department, because then they might need a supplemental oxygen, or they may need a nebulization treatment.”\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen says this respiratory difficulty – including a bobbing head, a flaring nose or grunting – is one of two major trouble signs with any respiratory infection. The other is dehydration. “That particularly applies to babies with stuffy noses. They may not be feeding.”\n\nMuch of the care provided by hospital staff will be to help with breathing.\n\n“We provide supportive measures for RSV and these kids with oxygen, IV fluids and respiratory therapies, including suctioning,” Soni said.\n\nA thin tube may need to be inserted into their lungs to remove mucus. A child can get extra oxygen through a mask or through a tube that attaches to their nose. Some children may need to use an oxygen tent. Those who are struggling a lot may need a ventilator.\n\nSome babies might also need to be fed by tube.\n\nHow to prevent RSV\n\nThe best ways to prevent RSV infections, doctors say, is to teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or into their elbows rather than their hands. Also try to keep frequently touched surfaces clean.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf a caregiver or older sibling is sick, Mora says, they should wear a mask around other people and wash their hands frequently.\n\nAnd most of all, if anyone is sick – child or adult – they should stay home so they don’t spread the illness.\n\nThere is a monoclonal antibody treatment for children who are at highest risk for severe disease. It’s not available for everyone, but it can protect those who are most vulnerable. It comes in the form of a shot that a child can get every month during the typical RSV season.

The first group was studied from 1998 to 2004, and the second group was studied from 2010 to 2016.\n\nThe difference between the two groups was striking: Around 16.2% of children who did not have weight issues when they entered kindergarten in 2010 were obese by the end of fifth grade, compared with 15.5% of participants in the same BMI category who started in 1998. Additionally, children studied in 2010 became obese at younger ages than their predecessors in the 1998 group.\n\nIn both groups, children who were overweight during their preschool years had a significantly higher risk of obesity than their peers who were not, researchers found.\n\n“Once you get on that train towards elevated weight gain, it’s really hard to turn it around, so prevention of overweight and obesity really early on are so important,” said Solveig Argeseanu Cunningham, first author of the study and associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nObesity occurs when a person has excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk, according to the World Health Organization. Adults who have a body mass index (BMI) – a calculation based on one’s height and weight – over 30 are considered obese. Childhood obesity is measured not by exact BMI, but by comparison to other children of the same age and sex. Those who are in the 95th percentile of BMI for their age and sex are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nObesity is a major underlying risk factor for many illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and severe cases of Covid-19, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n“Without intervention, we will continue to see increasing prevalence and severity of obesity for children at a younger age, which has really negative consequences down the line, not just for these children, but also for their future offspring,” said Dr. Jennifer Woo Baidal, director of the Pediatric Obesity Initiative at Columbia University in New York City. She was not involved in the study.\n\nChildhood obesity risk factors\n\nSince the study looked at children prior to the spread of Covid-19, it doesn’t account for the pandemic’s effects on childhood obesity. However, some doctors suspect that rates have continued to increase, especially among children of color.\n\nChildren of color, particularly Black and Hispanic children, were at the greatest risk of developing childhood obesity, according to the study. Non-Hispanic Black children who were not overweight when they entered kindergarten in 2010 were 29% more likely to develop obesity by fifth grade than their counterparts who started in 1998.\n\nSocioeconomic status was not a strong predictor of childhood obesity, according to the study.\n\n“That was unexpected because we’ve generally seen kids from wealthier households be more protected from a lot of health issues, especially obesity,” Cunningham said. “This really highlighted for me that obesity affects everybody across socioeconomic status.”\n\nSince the study only followed children until fifth grade, researchers are uncertain how socioeconomic status and race affected rates of obesity once the participants entered sixth grade and beyond. However, based on previous studies on adult obesity, it is likely that children of lower socioeconomic status would have greater rates of adult obesity, said Dr. Venkat Narayan, a senior author of the study and the executive director of the Global Diabetes Research Center at Emory.\n\n“Lack of access to healthy foods, lack of access to physical activity, higher unemployment, all of those factors can collaborate to increase the risk of diseases like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,” Narayan said.\n\nAn issue of public health\n\nSince 2010, numerous public health efforts have been implemented to reduce rates of childhood obesity, including Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Despite these efforts, rates of childhood obesity have increased, a sign that these actions may not be as beneficial as people assume, Cunningham said.\n\nExperts believe that lowering rates of childhood obesity may come down to public policy, such as improving school nutrition packages and expanding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\n“Those types of policy changes, there’s some evidence that they reduce food insecurity, improve nutrition, and can improve child weight outcomes together in an equitable way,” Baidal said.\n\nHowever, since socioeconomic status was not a major predictor of childhood obesity, policy changes may not be enough on their own, Narayan said.\n\nMore organized research is needed to find the factors leading to increased rates and earlier onsets of childhood obesity, as well as finding strategies to effectively prevent obesity from becoming more “severe,” he added.\n\n“Other countries keep large registries and databases, where they can have this timely surveillance of what is happening over time with individuals,” Baidal said. “It’s just another sign of the lack of investment in child health and (obesity) prevention in the United States.”\n\nHome interventions for childhood obesity\n\nTraditional methods of weight management, such as strict diets, don’t always work and can sometimes be unhealthy, Cunningham added.\n\nThere is no single recommended prevention or intervention method for childhood obesity. The most useful thing parents and caregivers can do is speak to their child’s pediatrician, Baidal said.\n\nTeaching healthy habits – including physical activity, nutrition, good sleep and reducing stress – is another way parents and caregivers can work toward decreasing childhood obesity, she added.\n\n“What the literature is showing is that the most effective treatment involves family based behavioral treatments, where we’re teaching families about behavioral strategies to help change the home environment,” said Dr. Kyung Rhee, professor of pediatrics at UC San Diego, who was not involved in the study.\n\nIt can be helpful for parents and caregivers to emphasize the importance of these habits for the whole family, so that the child does not feel shame or blame for their weight.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhile obesity can be a predictor of health issues, emphasizing weight loss is not always a helpful solution, said Rhee, who works with patients who have eating disorders and those with childhood obesity.\n\n“Reframe the whole thing in terms of healthier lifestyles and healthier environments,” Narayan said. “It’s better to talk about eating healthy, adequate physical activity for children, adequate play environments, safer play environments, particularly in poorer socioeconomic neighborhoods.”", "authors": ["Rachel Fadem"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/health/baby-sleep-products-safety-wellness/index.html", "title": "Babies will continue to die during sleep despite new regulations on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStore shelves holding baby products designed to help parents ease babies into sleep may be barren this week, due to new US Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations that went into effect on June 23.\n\nThe rules effectively limit the sale of infant sleep products to only four types that have existing safety standards: full and non-full size cribs, play yards, bassinets and cradles. Products formerly marketed for sleep – such as inclined sleepers, travel and compact bassinets, and in-bed sleepers – may no longer be sold for sleep, the commission said.\n\nBut child safety advocates CNN spoke to worry these new regulations, while well meant, will not make a significant dent in the number of annual infant deaths.\n\nThat’s because the real culprit may not be the manufactured products but the unsafe ways people use them, said Carol Pollack-Nelson, a human factors psychologist who worked for the CPSC and published a 2018 study on how human motivation affects the use of baby sleep products.\n\n“I looked at years of data from the CPSC’s nursery products annual report,” she said. “I found that almost all of the deaths from using these infant products – whether intended for sleep or not – were the direct result of the way the product was being used by a parent or caregiver.”\n\nA number of babies have died in rockers, inclined bouncers and other baby gear that was not made or sold for sleep. This spurred CPSC to mandate no more than a 10% incline in any sleep products including sleepers and sleep positioners – which are also called baby nests, docks, pods, loungers, rockers and nappers.\n\nSafety messages around sleeping babies may not fit cultural or emotional needs of new moms, Alison Jacobson, CEO of nonprofit New Candle, said. Taiyou Nomachi/Digital Vision/Getty Images\n\nBut that’s not going to stop “exhausted parents” from allowing baby to continue to nap in the car seat or bouncer, said Alison Jacobson, CEO of First Candle, a national nonprofit that’s committed to the elimination of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, and other sleep-related infant deaths through education and advocacy.\n\nNor will it keep parents and guardians from handing down some of these banned products to other new moms in the family or buying them off the second-hand market, Pollack-Nelson said.\n\n“I think from an optics perspective it looks like CPSC is doing something but they’re really not. In terms of whether or not it will actually effectuate change and reduce infant deaths. I actually think that it’s not going to do that.\n\n“Recalling and banning products or requiring modifications to products doesn’t address the root cause – which is behavior,” she said.\n\nCNN sent these concerns to the CPSC for comment and received this response: “CPSC urges parents to follow the advice we offer on our Safe Sleep website. Importantly, if parents and caregivers purchase or have inclined products, such as rockers, gliders, soothers, and swings, they should never use them for infant sleep and should not leave infants in these products unsupervised, unrestrained, or with bedding material, due to the risk of suffocation.”\n\nAn unfortunate plateau\n\nBetween 1994 and 1999, the rate of SIDS dropped by 50%, according to the National Institutes of Health, when rates of placing babies on their back to sleep doubled.\n\nBut other causes of infant death besides SIDS rose, including accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed.\n\nSince then, pediatricians and consumer safety advocates have struggled to reduce the number of infant sleep tragedies, which remain at some 3,500 deaths each year. The Safe Sleep for Babies Act, signed by US President Joe Biden in 2021, and the new CPSC regulations are designed to move that needle.\n\nSafety experts and manufacturers of sleep products have warned parents and caregivers for years to keep stuffed toys and soft bedding like blankets, pillows and crib bumpers out of a baby’s sleeping space due to the high risk of suffocation.\n\n“And yet according to CPSC annual reports, suffocation is the leading cause of death on these products,” Pollack-Nelson said.\n\nWhy are all of these communication efforts and regulations often failing to reach parents? Because those messages aren’t packaged in ways that are helpful to time-strapped, weary parents, Jacobson said.\n\n“Intuitively, I’m not going to read the manufacturers manual. I’m going to either go to Google or try to figure it out myself,” Jacobson said. “I’m also not going to go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I’m going to go on social media or call a friend.”\n\nIn addition, safety messages may not fit cultural or emotional needs of new mothers. Many infant deaths, for example, can be traced to co-sleeping. But studies by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that “on average, 68% of parents have babies in their bed at some point of the evening, whether that’s to breastfeed or whether the baby’s crying,” Jacobson said.\n\nTelling moms not to sleep with their babies is “the ultimate in tone deafness,” according to Pollack-Nelson.\n\n“Women all around the world do it. In the Burmese population, who traditionally bed-share, new moms are told by pediatricians not to bed-share, because it’s dangerous. But when that mom comes back into her community, she’s literally shamed if she is going against the culture,” Jacobson said.\n\nEffective outreach\n\nRelying on written manufacturer warnings isn’t good enough in today’s busy, online world, experts say. Information on how to keep babies safe at night needs to be disseminated on social media sites, in videos that are easy to watch and absorb, Pollack-Nelson said.\n\n“And we need to make these available for free to pediatricians and medical providers working with new moms, especially moms who are low-income and non-English speaking,” she said.\n\nAdvice should also be culturally sensitive, she said, because “if it’s insensitive to the real-life demands of being a parent, it’s going to likely backfire or just fall on deaf ears.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAt First Candle, Jacboson said, teams go into at-risk neighborhoods and meet with moms, dads and grandparents in person, engaging them in personalized conversations about how they put their baby to sleep.\n\n“Meeting exhausted parents where they are at and offering them safer solutions to their problems may be the way to finally reduce the number of infant deaths each year,” Jacobson said.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the products. It’s human error. We need to be reality based as well as evidence based, when it comes to communicating with parents about safe sleep.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/05/what-kawasaki-disease-linked-coronavirus/3083545001/", "title": "Coronavirus: More kids sick with Kawasaki symptoms related to ...", "text": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan to test all children with symptoms of a rare inflammatory condition for the coronavirus and its antibodies as dozens of cases have been identified across the country.\n\nIn New York City, at least 38 children are sick and one has died from the mystery illness that doctors say share similar symptoms with Kawasaki Disease. Almost all have tested positive for coronavirus or the antibodies that reflect exposure to the virus.\n\n\"To every parent out there: Early detection is the key to fighting this,\" de Blasio said. \"It can be treated. If you see these symptoms, take them seriously and act immediately.\"\n\nBoth Kawasaki disease and COVID-19 are elusive conditions that doctors are still studying. Some experts doubt there's a link between the two, and others don't believe the mysterious symptoms belong to Kawasaki at all.\n\nWhat is Kawasaki disease?\n\n“Kawasaki disease is one of the great mysteries in pediatrics,” said Dr. Frank Esper, a physician at the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases. “It’s something we’ve been dealing with for decades.”\n\nSymptoms include a fever of at least 101 degrees that lasts for five days or more, a rash and swollen glands in the neck, according to Britain's National Health Service. Esper says it predominately affects children ages 2 to 6, tends to run during \"mini-epidemics\" and is more likely to happen in the winter than the summer.\n\nWhile doctors know how to treat Kawasaki disease, they still don’t know what causes it or why some people get it. Esper says \"a cemetery of different reports\" have hypothesized the disease is caused by viruses, while others say people may be genetically predisposed.\n\n“Kawasaki disease is the boogeyman to pediatricians,” he said. “It’s extremely difficult to diagnose. Even with the most astute clinicians, we have a hard time figuring out who has it and who doesn’t.”\n\nEsper says the main indicator of the disease can be found in the heart. Coronary artery aneurysm, or a dilation of the coronary arteries, is what distinguishes Kawasaki from any other inflammatory disease.\n\nCases with COVID-19 concern identified in the US\n\nSymptoms have been identified in dozens of children across the United States, alarming pediatricians and raising concerns about a possible link to the coronavirus.\n\nFifteen cases were first reported last week by the New York Health Department in children between the ages of 2 and 15. The cases were identified between April 29 and May 3. All the patients had a fever, and more than half reported a rash, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nSince then, the state of New York as reported three deaths and at least 80 young people who have or are suffering from fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting. New York States officials have dubbed the mystery illness \"pediatric multisytem inflammatory syndrome.\"\n\nThe disease causes low blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat in children, with some patients developing inflammation of the heart as well as liver and kidney failure. Older children as well as the younger patients are affected.\n\nNew Jersey has seen at least 15 cases since March. The children ranged in age from 3 to 14, according to pediatric specialists who treated them. Three children remain in the pediatric intensive are unit and continue to improve, and two are expected to be released Monday.\n\nSo far, that's just a sliver of the 134,000 known cases in New Jersey, and the vast majority of children who get COVID-19 have either a mild case or no symptoms at all.\n\nThe New Jersey Health Department is seeking guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the syndrome and criteria for defining a case, said Donna Leusner, a department spokeswoman.\n\nIn Los Angeles, doctors at Children's Hospital have confirmed they're treating at least three patients with the disease, according to KABC-TV. All three cases tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, which means they likely had the coronavirus at one point before developing symptoms.\n\nChicago doctors have also reported several cases.\n\n\"These kids are testing negative with the nasal swab, but they are testing positive for antibodies in the bloodstream, which shows they had past infection, but their parents may not have known that,\" said Dr. Frank Belmonte, Chief Medical Officer at Advocate Children's Hospital, told WLS-TV.\n\nFirst cases of mystery illness appeared in Europe\n\nThe condition was first reported by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain in late April. Britain’s Paediatric Intensive Care Society issued an alert noting there had been an increase in the number of children with “a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care” across the country.\n\nThe group said there was growing concern that either a COVID-19 related syndrome was emerging in children or that a different, unidentified disease might be responsible.\n\nSpain’s Association of Pediatrics recently made a similar warning, telling doctors that in recent weeks, there had been a number of school-age children suffering from “an unusual picture of abdominal pain, accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms” that could lead within hours to shock, low blood pressure and heart problems.\n\nIn Italy, Dr. Angelo Ravelli of Gaslini Hospital and a member of the Italian Paediatricians' Society sent a note to 10,000 colleagues raising his concerns. He and his team reported an unusual increase in the number of patients with Kawasaki disease in regions of Italy hit hard by the pandemic, noting some children had COVID-19 or had contacts with confirmed virus cases.\n\nSome possible cases have also been reported in France and Belgium.\n\nIs Kawasaki disease related to the coronavirus?\n\nExperts say it's too early to tell if the disease can be associated with COVID-19.\n\n“We’ve never seen the coronavirus before, but we’ve been dealing with Kawasaki disease for decades,” Esper said.\n\nHe also says experts aren't even sure if the mystery disease popping up in parts of Europe and the U.S. can be definitively identified as Kawasaki disease. So far, he hasn't seen any the reports mention coronary artery dilation, which would be a major indication.\n\n\"I will caution that there are many things that look similar to Kawasaki disease,\" Esper said. \"It could be that what they’re calling Kawasaki is not Kawasaki but an inflammatory disease caused by the coronavirus.\"\n\nDo you think you have the coronavirus?: Here's what you should do.\n\n'Like a new diagnosis': Cancer families struggle to continue treatment amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nDr. Sunil Sood, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital and Cohen Children's Medical Center, doesn't believe the condition is Kawasaki.\n\nSood says patients he has treated have been sicker, with inflammatory markers 10 to 100 times higher than average child with Kawasaki disease.\n\nAlthough the New York City Health Department only mentioned 15 cases in their alert, Sood says he has had at least 20 cases between the two hospitals where he works. Only three of his cases tested positive for the coronavirus with the regular PCR test, but the rest tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\n\nHe estimates his patients may have had the virus, even unknowingly, four weeks before developing the inflammatory condition.\n\n\"The immune system can overreact in a delayed timeline many weeks later,\" Sood said. \"We know this from other infectious diseases.\"\n\nHe advises parents and pediatricians to look out for a fever as well as a combination of any of these symptoms: abdominal pain, confusion, diarrhea, red eyes, rash, swollen hands and feet, difficulty breathing and passing out. Sometimes the abdominal pain can be so severe it mimics appendicitis.\n\nSood urges parents to bring their children to the hospital if they develop any symptoms because it could lead to further heart complications, even acute heart failure.\n\n\"Initially, I thought it was Kawasaki ... but it's going beyond those symptoms,\" he said. \"Pediatricians and parents should be aware that there’s an outbreak of this right now.\"\n\nWhile there's a spike in such cases, Sood says children are still among the least affected group by the coronavirus. Data from more than 75,000 cases in China showed they comprised 2.4% of all confirmed cases and mostly suffered only mild symptoms.\n\nContributing: Lindy Washburn, Monsy Alvarado and Hannan Adely, NorthJersey.com; The Associated Press.

The board members addressed concerns from the public that adding Covid-19 vaccinations to the schedule would force schools to require the shots.\n\n“We recognize that there is concern around this, but moving Covid-19 to the recommended immunization schedule does not impact what vaccines are required for school entrance, if any,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, a committee member and director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Indeed, there are vaccines that are on the schedule right now that are not required for school attendance in many jurisdictions, such as seasonal influenza. Local control matters, and we honor that. The decision around school entrance for vaccines rests where it did before, which is with the state level, the county level and at the municipal level, if it exists at all. They are the arbiters of what vaccines are required, if any, for school entry. This discussion does not change that.”\n\nIn fact, Covid-19 vaccines are explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states. Only California and the District of Columbia have announced that Covid-19 shots will be among mandated vaccinations for students, but those mandates were not implemented for this school year.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine was expanded to include everyone in the US 5 and older, but coverage among children still lags behind that of adults. Even as these vaccines and the related mandates have become highly politicized over the course of the pandemic, experts say vaccine hesitancy among parents isn’t new.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 shot will not become mandatory for school, all 50 states do have laws requiring specific vaccines for students – most of which include shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and varicella.\n\nUptake for these vaccines, mandated by schools long before Covid-19, fell during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2020-21 school year, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell to less than 94% – dropping below the overall target of 95% that was set as an objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People project for the first time in six years.\n\nA CNN analysis of the latest CDC data suggests that students in states with stricter school vaccine requirements are more likely to have their shots.\n\nAll school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAccording to the CNN analysis, states that were stricter with exemptions were much more likely to still meet the 95% coverage target. In the 2020-21 school year, an average of about 96% of kindergarten students had their MMR vaccine in states that allowed only medical exemptions, compared with 92% of students in states that also allowed philosophical or moral exemptions.\n\nThe full effect of the pandemic on children’s routine vaccination rates isn’t clear: It will be another few months before the CDC shares national data for compliance rates for mandatory vaccinations in the 2021-22 school year, and schools are in the midst of outreach and programming to ensure that as many students as possible will continue through the 2022-23 school year up to date on their vaccines.\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn’t new\n\nCorrecting the drop in vaccination coverage in students will probably depend more on better access to care, information and outreach – and school vaccine mandates can help.\n\nWith many people who are hesitant, it’s “because of something they’ve heard or something they’ve read,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016. “Most people [who are hesitant] have a very free-floating worry about vaccines. It’s not specific in most cases.”\n\nA small share of parents – about 2% or 3% – are adamantly opposed to vaccines, and that rate has stayed mostly consistent over the years, said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.\n\nOverall vaccination coverage fell among kindergarteners in the 2020-21 school year, but the share of students who had an exemption also declined from 2.5% to 2.1%, according to CDC data. The rate has changed by less than 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.\n\nAbout 3% of kindergarteners in the US – about 120,000 students – were considered to be out of compliance with mandatory vaccines in the 2020-21 school year.\n\n“Mandates may not do anything to those people who would pull their kids out of public school,” Hackell said. “But the vast majority of parents are not opposed. They’re hesitant, or they’re uncertain. And when there’s pressure to do it for another reason, such as getting your kid into school, they come around.”\n\nResponsibility for enforcing vaccine mandates falls to the education system, and practices vary by state. Some students are ultimately turned away because they aren’t up to date, but most states offer provisional enrollment periods that allow kids to stay in school if they are in progress with at least one shot in a series or evidence of an upcoming appointment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “school officials may prefer to keep students in school where they have access to education, safe supervision, nutrition, and social services while working with parents or guardians to get children vaccinated.”\n\nAnd many states do their best to help students stay up to date on their immunizations, with vaccination drives and direct followup with parents.\n\n“I think that the drop in the past year or two is partly pandemic-related,” Hackell said. “What we’re seeing, I think, is a little bit of a disparity between kids who have a medical home and have a private [doctor] versus kids who get their immunizations from a public source” like a school clinic.\n\nA model of high vaccination: Mississippi\n\nMississippi is an impressive example of finding ways to keep child vaccination rates high, Hackell says. Public schools are the only option for many in the state, where poverty rates are higher than anywhere else in the US.\n\nDespite the large public need and additional resource struggles that the pandemic brought, 99% of kindergarteners in Mississippi met required vaccination coverage in the 2020-21 school year – better than any other state, according to the CDC.\n\n“They’ve done a tremendous job at that,” Hackell said, and it demonstrates the power of mandates. Mississippi is strict with exemptions – one of just six states allowing medical reasons only – and just 0.1% of kindergarteners were exempt in the 2020-21 school year.\n\nHackell says he would be most concerned if he sees a sustained drop in vaccination rates for highly transmissible diseases, especially measles and polio. And he’s worried about pockets of low vaccination rates in certain communities.\n\nSchools are public spaces with a level of control, and 95% vaccination coverage is a goal with intent.\n\n“We know it’s never going to be 100% because there are some people who cannot medically be vaccinated. But if you have 95%, that means in any given school classroom of 30 kids, there might be one unvaccinated kid. And so if that child brings a case of something into the class, there’s nobody else to give it to,” he said. “It stops there with one case.”\n\nAnd when it comes to adding Covid-19 vaccines to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule, the focus is still on public health – not on adding another requirement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’ve had parents who come in my office, and I say, ‘What are you here for?’ And they say, ‘Well, we’re here for vaccines so that our kids can go to school.’ And I’ve said, ‘OK, I understand that, but really I’m not vaccinating so you can go to school, I’m vaccinating because I want to prevent serious disease and death in your kids,’ ” Dr. Matthew Daley, an ACIP member and senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said at Thursday’s advisory meeting.\n\n“And the fact that there’s a school immunization requirement helps because it brought you into the office, but that’s not my goal.

Jackie is often seen doing yoga stretches, egg rolls and nest softening amid incubation periods, while Shadow can be seen bringing home fish and sticks.\n\n\"Jackie and Shadow have been extraordinary in their great care of their 3 eggs, patiently taking turns sitting on the eggs and sticking close to the nest even when it’s not their turn,\" Friends of Big Bear Valley wrote on Monday. \"Both Jackie and Shadow seem to be getting more patient with the incubation, with each other and with the quiet waiting.\"\n\nLast year's eggs failed to hatch in time\n\nSocial media fans were devastated last year when Jackie and Shadow's eggs failed to hatch during the 35-day watching window.\n\nIt was unclear why the eggs failed to hatch, with Friends of Big Bear Valley Executive Director Sandy Steers confirming to USA TODAY last March that altitude and temperature were among possible factors.\n\n“As to why the eggs have not hatched, we have no way of knowing,\" Steers wrote last year. \"It could be environmental, such as temperatures, humidity percentages, oxygen levels at high altitude, etc. It could be biological with something just being off at the time the eggs were created.\"\n\nHave the pair welcomed chicks before?\n\nJackie and Shadow previously welcomed sets of chicks in 2019 and 2022 so fans know the two are not infertile, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. However, the pair lost two eggs in 2023 and then three last March.\n\nThe losses have never stopped the two from trying. With each set of eggs the two eagles routinely switch places, argue over whose turn it is while gently tendering to their potential offspring, the non-profit said.\n\nFriends of Big Bear Valley encourage fans to watch their live feeds in the hopes of witnessing a successful hatch.\n\n\"Jackie and Shadow will continue to brood the hatchling and the remaining eggs, making sure they stay warm enough,\" the group wrote on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/03/california-bald-eagles-three-eggs/72458669007/", "title": "California bald eagles care for 3 new eggs as fans watch", "text": "A California bald eagle couple is now caring for three eggs as their loyal international following monitors the little family with bated breath.\n\nJackie and Shadow have been taking turns keeping the clutch warm since Jackie laid the first egg on Jan. 25; the other two followed on Jan. 28 and 31.

The gangly wood stork, with its long legs and bald head, is none of those.\n\nHowever, the bird has crafted its own comeback story. Once confined to remote reaches of the Everglades, where decades of ditching and draining left the storks and other wading birds in big trouble, storks now nest across the Southeast coastal plain.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed this month removing wood storks from the nation’s list of threatened and endangered species.\n\nIt's great to see the recovery of wood storks, said Nick Wiley, chief operating officer for Ducks Unlimited. \"It's a big success when a species can come off the list. This is what happens when we restore and protect wetlands.\"\n\nWhat is the Endangered Species Act?\n\nLike the bald eagle, wood storks should be considered a success for the federal Endangered Species Act, which turns 50 this year, Wiley said.\n\nAdopted under President Richard Nixon's administration in 1973, the act was intended to provide a way to protect and preserve ecosystems and a program to conserve and restore threatened and endangered species.\n\nCLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT COVERAGE: Subscribe to the weekly Climate Point newsletter\n\nREAD MORE: Latest climate change news from USA TODAY\n\nWhat is a wood stork?\n\nOnce you see a wood stork, they’re hard to forget.\n\nThe birds nest in the tops of cypress trees, perched over wetlands and swamps where lurking alligators below help keep predators at bay.\n\nThey stand 50 inches tall with a 60- to 65-inch wingspan.\n\nA pair of two chicks gobble an estimated 440 pounds of fish delivered by their parents over the 50 - 55 days from the time they hatch until they leave the nest.\n\nUnlike their parents, the scruffy, fluffy chicks have pink and yellow beaks and make a raucous noise while their silent parents stand watch.\n\nWithin two years, beaks of the fledged storks turn black and the feathers on their heads disappear.\n\nOTHER BIRDS: Roseate spoonbills feeling the effects of rising seas and warming climate\n\nWetland restoration efforts help rebuild wood stork population\n\nThe nation's only breeding population of wood storks was placed on the endangered species list in February 1984, after their numbers declined by more than 75% over 50 years.\n\nBiologists estimated 4,000 - 5,000 nesting pairs remained in fewer than 30 breeding colonies, and the storks rarely nested outside South Florida.\n\nToday, half the population nests outside the region, said Bill Brooks, a recovery biologist with the wildlife service. More than 11,000 nesting pairs are found in more than 100 breeding colonies across the coastal plains of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nSpoonbills extending their range: Roseate spoonbills feeling the effects of rising seas and warming climate\n\nBrooks also credits the recovery in part to wetland restoration efforts, such as a project undertaken by a farmer in Camilla, Georgia. The farmer approached the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about restoring a cypress wetland on his property, Brooks said. A ditch was filled and “boom, the storks arrived.\"\n\nRegular nesting in South Carolina was first documented in 1981. The state set a new record for nesting pairs in 2021, then topped that in 2022, counting 3,928 nests.\n\nA breeding colony was spotted in North Carolina in 2005. Five colonies were found in 2019.\n\nSome storks also migrate to Alabama and Mississippi after their annual breeding season, while wood storks from Central and South America migrate seasonally across the border.\n\nAre there still concerns?\n\nProposals to remove species from the endangered list are often greeted with concern and fear that without the extra protection the animal could end up where it was before – or worse. From the beginning, the act required goals to be set for when an animal or plant could be considered “recovered.”\n\nWood storks were upgraded from endangered to threatened in June 2014.\n\nOne criteria set to remove them from the list entirely was a five-year average of 10,000 nesting pairs, about half the historical population. That goal has been met.\n\nEven though storks meet the recovery goal in three of their four breeding regions, they do not on their historic turf — South Florida and the Everglades.\n\nThe biggest criteria for nesting success for the storks is water level. Getting water levels right has been an ongoing challenge for decades in the Everglades, where a multi-billion restoration is underway.\n\nAudubon Florida stated this week that South Florida's storks still experience fluctuations in nesting pairs depending on water levels, and climate change could bring even greater challenges for all the storks.\n\n\"While we celebrate many delistings,\" the organization stated, \"we have grave concerns for the future of the wood stork, especially if it is left without the protections afforded under the Endangered Species Act.\"\n\nThe delisting should serve as a reminder that many species remain imperiled because of wetland losses, said Wiley, a former director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \"There's more work to do.\"\n\nThe nation still loses tens of thousands of acres of wetlands a year.\n\nDig deeper", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/18"}]}

But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is no stranger to political controversies over Oscar, and that's not even counting the more subjective artistic arguments. With the help of Barry Monush, Oscars expert at the Paley Center for Media in New York, let's take a look at the impact of these kerfuffles, using a four-star system of High, Medium, Low, and No Impact.\n\nCitizen Kane : 1941-42\n\nIt's a brilliant, brutal portrait based on megalomaniac press magnate William Randolph Hearst, who mounted a ruthless campaign against the film.\n\nHe tried to buy it from boy wonder filmmaker Orson Welles to burn the negative, intimidated theaters from showing it, banned it from his papers, and questioned Welles' patriotism and private life. It worked, but not entirely: Nominated for nine Oscars, Kane won one, for best screenplay, which Welles shared with Herman Mankiewicz. And every time the film or Welles was mentioned at the ceremony, the crowd booed.\n\nImpact: Low. \"Welles still won,\" says Monush. Citizen Kane is today considered a masterpiece and Welles something of a genius, while Hearst's reputation was irreparably damaged by the film and by his own behavior.\n\nThe Brave One: 1956-57\n\nRobert Rich won for best motion picture story (an old category) but he didn't show up to claim it. Reporters scurried to find him as people claiming to be \"Robert Rich\" came out of the woodwork. In fact, he was screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted out of town and even went to jail during the mid-20th-century anti-communist panic. He had already won an Oscar in 1954, for Roman Holiday, under a different cover name; so had others. By 1975, the academy had given up the farcical pretense: Just before Trumbo died, he got his Oscar for The Brave One, with his real name on the trophy.\n\nImpact: Medium. The Rich/Trumbo win embarrassed Hollywood and the academy, and marked the beginning of the end of blacklisting in the film industry.\n\nKlute : 1971-72\n\nJane Fonda, known as \"Hanoi Jane\" for her anti-Vietnam War activism, won the best actress Oscar and the watching audience held its breath, wondering if she would launch into a rant. She didn't. \"There's a great deal to say, and I'm not going to say it tonight.\" The sigh of relief from the audience was audible.\n\nImpact: Low. \"It was the industry's way of saying, we know she's controversial but we still think she's great. And she did the right thing by holding back,\" Monush says.\n\nCharlie Chaplin: 1972\n\nHe was one of the most important filmmakers of all time and yet between 1929 and 1972 he never won an Oscar,even though he was beloved by Hollywood and movie audiences. But the U.S. government and the FBI hounded him. His politics leaned left, his personal life was messy (paternity suit), and his three wives were teens when he married them. As a Brit, he could be banned from the USA, and eventually he exiled himself for two decades. He had won an honorary award in 1929 (for The Circus) but only in 1972 did he return to accept an honorary Oscar for his career achievements, awarded after the best picture of that year was awarded. To this day, the standing ovation remains the longest on record.\n\nImpact: Low. \"The applause was thunderous. Nobody in the academy held anything against him,\" Monush says.\n\nT he Godfather : 1972-73\n\nMarlon Brando won best actor but did not show up. Instead, in an unexpected and mysterious protest of the industry's stereotyping of Native Americans in Westerns, he sent someone named Sacheen Littlefeather (not her real name), dressed in buckskins and feathers, to refuse for him on behalf of Indians. She made a brief speech after she was prevented from reading Brando's 15-page rant letter on the topic.\n\nImpact: High. \"It was jaw-dropping, the most outrageous evening. It made everyone look bad, and didn't do much for Indians, either. It made a real issue a farce,\" Monush says.\n\nHearts and Minds : 1974-75\n\nBert Schneider won for best documentary for his film, Hearts and Minds, about the futility and mendacity of America's conduct of the Vietnam War. Unlike Fonda, he did not hold back. He even read a telegram from the enemy North Vietnamese thanking the American anti-war movement \"for all they have done on behalf of peace.\" Co-hosts Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope were outraged, disavowed academy responsibility and apologized afterwards. This in turn annoyed third co-host Shirley MacLaine, who said her pals Sinatra and Hope did not speak for her.\n\nImpact: High. Everybody looked bad. \"Do we need this back and forth at the Oscars? It was all inappropriate,\" Monush says.\n\nJulia : 1977-78\n\nVanessa Redgrave, as famous for her Palestinian sympathies as her acting, won best supporting actress for the film set in Nazi Germany, after a campaign against her by the Jewish Defense League. They argued she should not win because of her politics and sent picketers to the ceremony. In her acceptance speech, Redgrave denounced anti-Semitism, fascism and racism, but also saluted the academy for refusing to be \"intimidated by a few Zionist hoodlums.\" Boos and applause followed.\n\nLater, Paddy Chayefsky and Charlton Heston chastised her. Chayesfsky, who won the Oscar for best screenplay for Network that year, said he was \"sick and tired of people exploiting the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal propaganda.\" Heston, who said he voted for Redgrave, said he thought it was \"as much an error to interject what amounted to political commentary into her acceptance remarks as it was an error for people to oppose her nomination on political grounds.\"\n\nImpact: High. \"If she had handled it like Jane Fonda, it would have been less controversial. It rankled everyone,\" Monush says.\n\nMy Cousin Vinny : 1992-93\n\nThis one is truly an urban myth, believed to have been started by film critic Rex Reed.Marisa Tomei won the best-supporting actress Oscar but supposedly it was a mistake after a confused presenter, Jack Palance, read the wrong name off the front of the envelope instead of the inside. This claim was disproved, the academy denied it vigorously, and Tomei called it \"hurtful.\" The Price Waterhouse accountants also said that their agreement with the academy called for one of them to step on stage and say a presenter misspoke in case such a mistake were ever made.\n\nImpact: None. \"It never happened, it could never happen.\"\n\nElia Kazan: 1999\n\nThe director of such classics as On the Waterfront and East of Eden had already won one Oscar (Gentlemen's Agreement) by the time he \"named names\" of his old friends who once were communists to anti-communist witch-hunters in Congress in 1952. He would go on to win one more (for Waterfront) and to be nominated three other times, but some in Hollywood, especially the blacklisted, could never forgive him. Bitter arguments broke out when the academy sought to give him a career achievement Oscar in 1999, and hundreds of protesters picketed outside the ceremony. When Kazan accepted the trophy, some in the audience sat on their hands, but most rose in ovation.\n\nImpact: High. People still get emotional about what Kazan did, but in the end the academy awarded the art. \"They weren't rewarding his politics, they were rewarding his films, especially Waterfront.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBowling for Columbine : 2002-2003\n\nDirector Michael Moore won the Oscar for best documentary and accepted with a tirade against \"fictitious\" President George W. Bush and his \"fictitious\" war in Iraq. Boos and cheers followed.\n\nImpact: Medium: \"Even if I agree with all he said, was it really the time to do it? I thought he'd have more support but I realized then how many conservatives there are in the academy. It was a mix,\" says Monush.\n\nThe Pianist : 2002-2003\n\nRoman Polanski won for best director (the Holocaust drama also won two other Oscars) but could not be there to accept because he's a fugitive, wanted in the U.S. for fleeing after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old. His nomination (his third) sparked debate in Hollywood and he was considered an underdog. When he won, most in the audience stood in ovation.\n\nImpact: Medium. \"It's the ultimate example of Hollywood saying, yes, we know he did something wrong, but we want to honor the work,\" says Monush.\n\nZero Dark Thirty : 2012-2013\n\nEven before the movie about killing Osama bin Laden was made, some Republicans in Congress called for an investigation into whether the Obama administration leaked classified information to filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal. After the film was released, some academy members called for a boycott because the film contained scenes that allegedly could lead to greater acceptance of torture. Bigelow, the first woman to win best director (for 2008's The Hurt Locker), is snubbed. Zero got five nominations but won only one, for sound editing.\n\nImpact: Medium: \"She wasn't even nominated, so maybe it did have some impact,\" says Monush.\n\nBlue Jasmine: 2013-2014\n\nWoody Allen is accused by his ex-lover, Mia Farrow, and two of their children of molesting his daughter 21 years ago when she was 7 and he and Farrow were going through a toxic breakup. Now that his latest film, Blue Jasmine, is up for three Oscars, the Farrows have used social media to raise the unproven allegation again, apparently to damage him, the film and maybe even its nominated lead actress, Cate Blanchett.\n\nPossible impact: None, Monush predicts. Mudslinging usually doesn't work. \"I'm looking forward to seeing Cate Blanchett win.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/09/15/mash-turns-50-revisiting-its-legacy-and-record-breaking-success/10370697002/", "title": "'M*A*S*H' turns 50: Revisiting its legacy, and record-breaking success", "text": "Jim McKairnes\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIt began as a satire, morphed into comedic drama, made Emmy history through 11 seasons, and ended with a final episode watched by TV’s biggest audience for a scripted series.\n\nFifty years after its debut, \"M*A*S*H\" is still saluted as one of television’s finest (half)-hours.\n\nAdapted from director Robert Altman’s Oscar-nominated 1970 film, \"M*A*S*H\" premiered on Sept. 17, 1972. It told of the boisterous and messy life at a South Korean-set Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (explaining the title acronym) during the Korean War of the early 1950s.\n\nThe ensemble cast – Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Loretta Swit, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff – was mostly unfamiliar to TV viewers. Among them, only Stevenson had a small-screen profile, thanks to a two-year supporting role on \"The Doris Day Show.\" (As naïve-but-efficient Corporal Walter ‘Radar’ O’Reilly, Burghoff was the lone principal cast member from the film to transition to the series.)\n\nHappy birthday to us: USA TODAY turns 40: Celebrating 40 moments that mattered most to our newspaper\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn a 1998 interview with the Television Academy Archive, writer and co-creator Larry Gelbart, who was tasked by producer Gene Reynolds with adapting the film, said he told Reynolds that he’d take on the assignment “only if what we did could be true to the spirit of the motion picture.” In a phrase: anarchy in a war zone.\n\nBut Gelbart, a respected veteran writer of both live 1950s TV (\"Caesar’s Hour\") and of 1960s Broadway (\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\"), said that because the country was still fighting in Vietnam in 1972, “there was no intention to trivialize that effort by simply doing another gang comedy set in an Army background.” So \"M*A*S*H\" would have to walk a fine line. Reynolds and CBS agreed. A pilot and series pickup followed.\n\nEarly ratings for the show, scheduled on Sunday nights opposite NBC warhorse \"Wonderful World of Disney\" and ABC’s long-running \"The FBI,\" were disappointing to dismal. Not helping: CBS’s decision to position the show between another film-to-series adaptation – the poorly received and short-lived \"Anna and the King,\" based on \"The King and I\" and starring that film’s Yul Brynner – and \"The Sandy Duncan Show.\" (Trivia alert: \"Anna and the King\" was also produced by Gene Reynolds.) \"M*A*S*H\" was little noticed.\n\nBut it was more than a bad time slot that \"M*A*S*H\" was battling. Viewer expectations and TV conventions were also at issue: In honoring the spirit of the Altman film, the series version zigged where other more conventional sitcoms zagged, teetering between high jinks and pathos. Case in point: “Sometimes You Hear the Bullet,” its 17th episode, broadcast in January 1973, in which lead surgeon Hawkeye Pierce dealt with the death of a patient who was also a childhood friend. It featured what became known by fans as the \"Two Rules speech,\" given by M*A*S*H leader Henry Blake (Stevenson) in an attempt to console a tearful Pierce. (“All I know is what they taught me at Command School. There are certain rules about a war. And rule number one is, young men die. And rule number two is, doctors can’t change rule number one.”)\n\nA Lucille Ball sitcom – still on the air in 1973 – it was not.\n\n\"M*A*S*H\" finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series. But it also was showered with nine Emmy nominations. Eking out a renewal, it was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \"All in the Family,\" then TV’s highest-rated show, where \"M*A*S*H\" became the smash it would remain for another decade. At the 1974 Emmy Awards, it was named Best Comedy, with Alda winning as Best Comedy Actor.\n\n\"M*A*S*H\" continued to rewrite the rules of TV comedy in success, changing both how it could be written and shot, through the eyes of a patient, with on-camera interviews about life in a war zone or shown in real time, complete with an on-screen ticking clock or with a dramatization of nightmares. It also weathered multiple cast changes: Stevenson, Rogers, Linville and Burghoff left during the series’ middle years, with Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell, and David Ogden Stiers added to the cast. Lower-profile roles played by Jamie Farr (Corporal Klinger) and William Christopher (Father Mulcahy) were later expanded, too.\n\nIt was Stevenson’s departure after the third season that saw \"M*A*S*H\" in ultimate defiance of sitcom convention: “Abyssinia Henry” killed off Blake just as the bumbling commanding officer was heading home to the States.\n\nDevotees tend to draw a line between two distinct eras for the long-running series (which lasted nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself): Seasons 1 through 5, when it was chiefly a military satire shaped by Gelbart (who left in 1976) and run by Reynolds (who left in 1977); and Seasons 6 through 11, influenced if not overseen by lead actor Alda, who’d become the face of \"M*A*S*H\" as well as its frequent writer and director. Under Alda, the series drifted into broader social commentary about the human condition (PTSD, sexism, racism) and the general fog of war.\n\n(Alda made Emmy history with wins in three separate categories throughout its run : acting, writing, and directing.)\n\nBy Season 10, Alda, coming off a successful movie directorial debut (\"The Four Seasons\"), was ready to leave the show. But CBS squeezed out a shortened 11th season, to be tied up with a war-ending 2½-hour finale that Alda directed. Following months of publicity and drum-beating, “Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen” aired on Feb. 28, 1983. Nearly half the country – 105 million people -- tuned in to see their longtime favorites finally go their own separate ways.\n\nWhen \"M*A*S*H\" premiered in 1972, it was the latest in a line of CBS comedy fare aimed at better reflecting a changing country, ushered in by the success of \"All in the Family\" a year earlier. Gone were longtime older-skewing rural-sitcom mainstays (\"Petticoat Junction,\" \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"). That September brought big-city character comedies that provoked (\"Maude\") or showcased more sophisticated storytelling (\"The Bob Newhart Show\"). By the time \"M*A*S*H\" ended, in a three-network TV universe, the kind of dramatic comedy that \"M*A*S*H\" helped introduce had become a prime-time staple. By the end of the decade, there’d even been an official term introduced – the “dramedy” – to describe the hybrid.\n\nOf the eleven principals seen over the course of the show's 251 episodes, only five – Alda, Swit, Burghoff, Farrell and Farr – survive.\n\nAnd \"M*A*S*H\"’s record as the TV show with the most-watched series finale stands.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten. But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock. According to a newspaper account, the \"howls of a burning menagerie ... mingled with shrieks of women and children.\"\n\n30. 1887: Artesian well water becomes available for the first time, establishing Memphis as a city with notably pure drinking water.\n\n31. On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

It is 8 mph.\n\n43. Edward Hull Crump is elected mayor of Memphis in 1909.

May 8, 1925: Immortalized as \"a very worthy Negro\" on an obelisk in the park that bears his name, 39-year-old levee worker Tom Lee — who could not swim — makes four trips in his small skiff, the Zev, to rescue 32 of the 72 people in danger of drowning in the swift currents of the Mississippi after the 1925 sinking of the M.E. Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing. It is a barbaric symphony of passion and hatred, spilling from a blood-tinted screen. It is mental and physical putrefaction.\"\n\n57. Aviator Charles Lindbergh, 25, visits Memphis in October 1927, some five months after his solo flight across the Atlantic makes him one of the world's most celebrated men.

A decade after TV came to New York, it arrives in Memphis when WMC — then co-owned by The Commercial Appeal — signs on the air on Dec. 11, 1948. After an hour of test patterns, dedications, political proclamations and backstage tours, the \"entertainment\" programming begins with Santa Claus, live on the air, reading letters from kids.

A mere satellite compared to the nuclear furnace of Sun, Cordell Jackson's Moon Records label in 1956 releases Jackson's double-sided holiday single, \"Rock and Roll Christmas,\" backed by \"Beboppers' Christmas.\" The latter song contains perhaps the most memorable introduction of St. Nick since Clement Moore's: \"He had white fuzz all over his chin/ He came boppin' up and said, 'Give me some skin.'\"\n\n78. Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival.

A prime example of 1950s Polynesian exotica, the Luau restaurant opens at 3135 Poplar in February 1959.

Sugarmon Jr., the future General Sessions judge. Sputnik was fined $26.\n\n82.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca. Sample lyric: \"Not too many things can bend him out of shape/ His mama must have come from the Planet of the Apes.\"\n\n133. Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149. Oct. 30, 1983: Founded in 1901, Bellevue Baptist Church votes to leave its longtime Midtown location and relocate to a Cordova campus, where it expands to \"megachurch\" proportions.\n\n150. \"While most of us were stuffing ourselves with turkey,\" The Commercial Appeal reports on Nov. 25, 1983, \"a pair of armed, Halloween-masked gunmen pulled off the largest robbery in Memphis history, stealing an estimated $2 million from the Wells Fargo building on Monroe.\"\n\n151. Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet.

During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

In Washington D.C., he was the Honorable Sonny Bono, Republican member of the House of Representative for California’s 44th District. But, to everyone else, he was Sonny.\n\nHe and his fourth wife, Mary, often went skiing around Lake Tahoe. Sonny had grown close to the late Bill Harrah, owner of the Harrah’s Hotel and Casinos, when he and Cher were TV’s biggest musical stars of the 1970s. Harrah’s Lake Tahoe was like a second home to him.\n\nCongress was on break and the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which Sonny founded in 1990 as mayor of Palm Springs, wasn’t due to start until Jan. 8. So, Sonny and Mary went skiing with some friends to usher in 1998.\n\nTwenty years later, former Congresswoman Mary Bono recalled that their friends had gone home by Jan. 5. But Sonny, Mary and their kids, Chesare, 9, and Chianna, 6, took to the slopes for one more day at the Heavenly Ski Resort.\n\nSonny, 62, could tear up the intermediate ski runs. He had back problems and had been taking the painkiller, Vicodin, since a 1995 surgery to remove a growth on his fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. But it didn't restrict his mobility.\n\nHe didn’t wear a helmet, but a skiing accident six days earlier, resulting in the death of Michael Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy, had prompted Sonny and Mary to discuss helmets. Sonny said he’d get one before their next ski trip.\n\nA more immediate problem was another damn regulation – one of the many Sonny seemed to have spent his political career fighting. Ski shops demanded that older skiers set their bindings with a lighter release point than required of younger athletes to make it easier to pop out of the skis and escape serious injury after a fall. Sonny had to sign a waiver, Mary said, to get his bindings clamped down more tightly than recommended.\n\nAround mid-day, the family prepared to ski down the Orion slope. Sonny was in the lead, followed by Chesare and Chianna with Mary taking up the rear in case anyone fell.\n\nSonny took off with a big smile on his face. “Ches, follow me,” he called to his son. Ches took off, but his ski caught an edge, causing him to spin around and impact Chianna. Mary tended to the children, but then, Sonny was gone.\n\nMary and the kids skied to the first stop area, but Sonny wasn’t there. They began looking for him with more curiosity than panic. But that changed as the day wore on. History would change as the week wore on.\n\nRecalling the drama\n\nMary Bono recalled the events leading to the discovery of Sonny’s body three days after he went missing. The national media had surrounded the South Palm Springs house she and Sonny had bought shortly after their marriage in 1986. They saw a macabre story developing with a rare confluence of celebrity politics and show biz, and descended on a town that had long been famous for shielding celebrities from the limelight. Now, Mary only wanted to talk to a journalist she knew from the desert.\n\nI went to the house I had visited several times for the Bonos' founders parties for the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Sonny had conceived the festival idea in this house. He had joined the Palm Springs Chamber of Commerce to promote his Bonos restaurant, but he started exploring a film festival as a way to draw more people to Palm Springs while serving as head of its restaurant and hospitality committee.\n\nThe Bono house on slightly elevated land seemed dark and empty. The kids were playing in the backyard. Mary’s father, Clay Whittaker, was caring for her. But Sonny was gone, a fact Mary couldn't accept in the first few hours after his disappearance. At first, she assumed Sonny had been skiing so fast, he just zoomed by the first rest area.\n\n“We went to the next little spot and waited,” Mary said in an emotional, stream-of-consciousness interview. “We skied to the bottom and he wasn’t anywhere. I was wondering if he fell, or if he went to the right and I went to the left – if he went down to a different chair. You know, all these things can happen.”\n\nAfter 30 minutes, the family was uneasy. They asked the ski patrol if there had been any accidents on Orion slope. None reported, they were told. They waited a little longer, but then, Mary and the kids felt compelled to look for him. They took the ski lift up the hill, scanning the slopes along the way. They looked as far as their eyes could see from the top of the mountain, but saw nothing. So they went back down. Then they went back up.\n\n“The kids were so cold, they were crying,” Mary recalled. “I said, ‘OK. He had to have skied to the very bottom. That’s what happened. He’ll be there waiting for us.”\n\nThey went down the mountain – all the way down – and he wasn’t there. They went to guest services at 4 p.m. and were told he must have gone to the wrong lodge. He must have gone to the California side of Lake Tahoe. Mary said Sonny knew the mountain too well. He wouldn’t have done that. At 4:30 p.m., the ski patrol listed him as missing. Then they began calling the buses, hoping against long odds he might have gone so far astray, he needed a ride back to the correct lodge.\n\nMary called friends and continued talking to members of the ski patrol. One officer said, “It doesn’t look good.”\n\nAfter 6 p.m., the sheriff and president of the ski resort told Mary they had found a body. Sonny had collided with a tree. And, with the force of the collision, Mary learned later, he probably would have been left brain dead even if he had been wearing a helmet.\n\nMary begged them to let her go to the scene of the accident. They put her in a snowmobile and she trudged up the mountain one more time.\n\n“It was the longest snowmobile ride,” she told me through tears, “but I never wanted it to end. The minute I got there, I saw his feet and his legs, and I knew it was him.”\n\nAfter another long trip down the mountain, a journey she calls “our last run together,” Mary was faced with an even tougher task. She had to tell her kids their father was dead. In retrospect, she said she could have done it more tactfully.\n\n“I was in shock,” she said in a recent telephone interview. “I didn’t have time to prepare or think about, ‘How do I break this kind of news to my children?’ I didn’t have anybody with me. When I came back down, I just sort of blurted it out: Sonny was dead and had gone to heaven. I don’t know how else you can deliver that kind of news. I don’t know how you sugarcoat it. I don’t know what the hell you can do.”\n\nMedia mélange\n\nThe most sublime details of that day remain frozen in Mary’s head like a tableau in a play.\n\n“I remember it as if it was yesterday,” she said. “We were starting to go back to the hotel room and I had to pack everything up, including all of Sonny’s things – which was odd. It was just me and the kids, and I had to make phone calls to people. (The news story) was breaking that evening. I guess somebody heard it on a sheriff’s radio. Rumors were getting out. By the morning, I turned on the TV and I was seeing people that hadn’t talked to Sonny in years on television talking about him. I was watching the news make up stories about what had happened. I left the hotel and went to the airport. Dick Heckmann had sent his plane for us and, as we pulled out onto the tarmac, the press was landing. We were watching them get off another plane as we were boarding. When we landed, it was more and more surreal by the minute.”\n\nThe national media had camped out several rows deep behind the black iron gates of the Bono estate.\n\nIt was the beginning of the second wave of the cable news era, following the Gulf War that had turned CNN into an international powerhouse. MSNBC and the Fox News Channel had launched in 1996 and Time Warner had merged with CNN’s parent company, the Turner Broadcasting System, that same year. Suddenly, there was an unprecedented appetite for populist visual news. The death of Cher’s former husband and show biz partner, who was now a favorite of Newt Gingrich’s Republican-controlled Congress, was the perfect storm for the new media forces.\n\nThe funeral was scheduled for Friday and not only was Cher expected to attend, but President Bill Clinton was sending Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who had listened to Sonny’s pleas to get federal help to save the Salton Sea. Gingrich was said to be bringing a Congressional delegation that “could exceed 100 members.” Former President Gerald Ford, California Gov. Pete Wilson and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who didn’t live in the Coachella Valley then, also were on the guest list.\n\nThe day after the funeral at St. Theresa Catholic Church in Palm Springs, Mary was scheduled to speak in her husband’s place at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Gala. So there was justification for national news organizations to send full crews to sunny Palm Springs for a week.\n\nBut, what made the cable news companies hungry to cover the aftermath of Sonny’s death was the culture-changing impact of the news coverage of Princess Diana’s sudden death just four months earlier. Princess Di’s funeral on Sept. 6, 1997 remains the most-watched news event in UK history. Non-stop coverage resulted in record ratings for MSNBC and Fox News. CNN ratings spiked to their highest levels since the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995.\n\nSo the cable news channels expanded their 24-hour news cycle to almost a week, covering spontaneous vigils and generating stories to run around the clock in much the same way networks had covered the John F. Kennedy death in 1963. The cable channels paid local society reporters to act as “spotters” to identify local VIPs through the funeral coverage.\n\nAs the one entertainment writer allowed to interview Mary, I stepped into the uncomfortable territory between messenger and reporter.\n\nMary’s media aide had me enter the house from a side entrance to avoid the media throng at her gate. But, the emotion of the interview left me somewhat dazed. We cried together as she talked about this man I had worked with and performed with in a benefit roast for the Desert Theatre League. Mary and I broke protocol by hugging after the interview was over. Then I stumbled out the wrong door and was blocked on my way to my car by those iron gates manned by inquiring journalists.\n\nSuddenly, I was literally on the wrong side of the fence. Reporters were throwing questions like, “How’s Mary? “Is Cher coming to the funeral?” “How are Cher and Mary getting along?” I didn’t even have a cell phone to call for help. It was 1998.\n\nI was desperate to escape, but the electronic gate wouldn’t open automatically because I didn’t approach it in a vehicle. I fielded a couple questions and was photographed searching for a way around the iron bars. I frankly don’t remember how I broke away from the press, but I vividly remember avoiding the temptation of climbing over those black rods because I knew it would be all over the national news.\n\nOdyssey to the funeral\n\nMary had invited Cher and her grown kids Elijah, (with Gregg Allman), and Chastity (now Chaz, Cher's transgender son with Sonny) to stay with her before the funeral. Sonny’s friends, including Denis Pregnalato, who once ran the film festival, were in and out of the house. The Southern California Congressional delegation of Ken Calvert, David Dreier and Jerry Lewis also offered more than political support.\n\n“They were in my house every day that week to make sure things were OK,” Mary said. “The other one was Larry Parrish (chief executive officer of Riverside County). Larry was in my home doing dishes. He was amazing. He never asked a thing from me, but he was in my house every day making sure things were taken care of. I really didn’t know him until then. But, this is just what people did. They came in and pitched in and helped out. It was such a huge circus.”\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mary got a phone call from President Clinton, asking if there was anything he could do. Mary shed her grieving widow role and reacted like the district representative she would soon agree to become.\n\n“Actually, there is,” she said she told him. “There’s the Salton Sea out here, (which) Sonny had wanted to be his legacy.”\n\nShe said Clinton replied, “I’ll see what I can do.”\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mary and Cher had a long talk. Mary was thinking about wearing a conservative dark suit to the funeral and she asked Cher, “What are you going to wear?”\n\n“I’m going to go like Cher,” replied the Oscar, Emmy and Grammy award-winning star.\n\nMary said afterwards Cher was “a constant source of comfort to me.”\n\n“I invited her to be involved,” Mary recalled. “I invited her to stay with us. I thought it was really important that all of the bad words, all the bad years become meaningless. And Chastity, now Chaz, is someone I love very much – then and now. It was extremely hard on Chaz. You’ve probably read that Chaz and Sonny were estranged at the time over politics. That’s the lesson everyone needs to heed, this not-to-speak-to-each-other over a silly difference. I think it’s much harder on Chaz because of that. My kids were just concerned that I would be OK. They needed to know I would be OK so they would be OK. Then we’d all be OK.”\n\nCher wrote her eulogy in Mary’s house and her assistant input it into Mary’s bedroom computer. It turned out to be perhaps the most memorable part of the funeral. Cher recalled a Reader’s Digest feature in which readers wrote about “the most unforgettable character I ever met.” She called Sonny Bono her most unforgettable character ever.”\n\nThe funeral coverage more than tripled CNN’s audience and doubled MSNBC’s average number of viewers. A CNN spokesman said covering celebrity funerals had become “a way of communal mourning. It’s a way for people who can’t be there to gather around the television set and pay their respects.”\n\nBut Mary wasn’t done with her public catharsis. Sonny usually made a speech at the film festival like stand-up comic. On Saturday, Mary had to step into his shoes.\n\n“I was still in shock,” she said. “It was just so horrible that Sonny couldn’t be there. I wasn’t used to being the one going up on stage to speak. It was sort of the beginning of what I’d have to learn to do.”\n\nSpeaking from the heart, Mary said, “How can I thank you and express my gratitude to each and every one of you for the love and support you have given my family? Thanks for the incredible and endless outpouring of love.”\n\nPregnalato, an executive with Aaron Spelling Films, announced plans to build a statue of Sonny in the Mercado Plaza in downtown Palm Springs. He also announced plans to present an annual Sonny Bono Visionary Award, beginning in 1999, to a filmmaker “who explores new frontiers in film.” Director Baz Luhrmann (2002), writer Sidney Sheldon (2004), actor Kevin Spacey (2005) and director Quentin Tarantino (2010) are among the recipients of the Bono Visionary Award.\n\nThat trophy wasn’t presented last year and there are no plans to give one this week. Board Chairman Harold Matzner says it hasn't been abandoned and not every award is given annually. But Mary said she hasn’t been invited to Tuesday’s Awards Gala, which is sold out.\n\nMary predicted this year’s festival will be “beautiful and spectacular and successful.” But she’s busy championing a remedy to the opioid addiction epidemic, which she first tackled as a Congresswoman. Mary was criticized in 1998 for revealing Sonny’s Vicodin addiction. But her embrace of pharmaceutical dependency as a cause, following Chesare’s public revelation that he became addicted to Oxycontin five years after Sonny’s death, is now seen as prescient. Mary was in Chicago, meeting with the National Association Boards of Pharmacy as part of her job as a principal for the Faegre Baker Daniels international consulting firm when she spoke with The Desert Sun.\n\nShe says finding a solution to this public epidemic could be tied to Sonny's legacy.\n\n“It’s absolutely relevant,” she said. “(Sonny) had become addicted to Vicodon and I was trashed when I said that. Absolutely trashed by the public. It really proved, and still proves, unfortunately, there’s just such a stigma around substance abuse disorder.\n\n“I actually think that had Sonny survived he would have absolutely come around and become its champion talking about the dangers of opioids. I think, had he been around today, he’d be a fantastic champion on it.”\n\nMary sold her house in Palm Springs and put her furniture in storage until she could find time to buy a new house with her husband, Rear Admiral and former astronaut Stephen Oswald. She said she loves and remains devoted to Palm Springs. But she's still haunted by the events of 20 years ago.\n\n“On the fifth, it just happens to me every year,” she said. “I will go into a little funk. It’s just weird because I don’t believe in that stuff. But, on that day, I just have to shut the curtains and stay inside. It just takes a toll on me.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/06/06/watch-pat-sajak-final-wheel-of-fortune-episode/73998808007/", "title": "'Wheel of Fortune': How to watch Pat Sajak's final episode as host", "text": "Pat Sajak's final episode hosting \"Wheel of Fortune\" has arrived.\n\nSajak announced in June 2023 that he was planning to retire after hosting the popular game show for 41 seasons, saying it had been a \"wonderful ride.\"\n\nVanna White, who has served beside Sajak on the show since 1983, decided to stay with the show but said in response to Sajak's announcement, \"I couldn't be happier to have shared the stage with you for all these years with one more to come.

So I've had time to sort of get used to it. And it's been a little bit wistful and all that,\" Sajak told his daughter, \"I've been enjoying it, taking it all in and reflecting on the great run.\"\n\nHow to watch Pat Sajak's final episode of 'Wheel of Fortune'\n\nYou can check times and your local station for \"Wheel of Fortune\" on the show's website.

He likewise received a lifetime achievement award in 2011.\n\nGuinness World Records recognized Sajak as the longest-serving game show host for the same show in 2019.\n\nA Chicago native, Sajak started his career in radio, first serving as a newsman on a local radio station and then as a disc jockey in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, working for the American Forces Vietnam Network.

USA TODAY spoke with Stoll as well as husband-and-wife co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (2018 Oscar winners for the climbing documentary \"Free Solo\") to break down the details of the 2013 epic endeavor.\n\nDid Diana Nyad actually swim all the way from Cuba to Florida unassisted?\n\nStoll, who \"watched every stroke of that swim,\" says the record is unquestionable. That said, some have done just that ever since Nyad reached the shores of Key West.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nShortly after the swim ended, critics questioned how Nyad could have made the swim in those 53 hours, given that GPS coordinates suggested unusual speeds for certain segments of the swim. Others complained there weren't enough independent monitors for the feat, or that she might have been aided by crew.\n\nNyad has repeatedly rejected such claims, citing everything from speed-boosting currents to jealousy. Chin, an accomplished professional climber, says there are very few athletes who push the limits of their sport without generating detractors. \"Everyone has naysayers,\" he says.\n\nDid Bonnie Stoll walk out on Diana Nyad after her failed attempts to swim to Florida?\n\nThat conflict was created to keep the plot of \"Nyad\" taut, Stoll says. In reality, while there was a break during failed attempts to swim to Florida, Stoll was never going to throw in the towel as coach.\n\n\"That split in our relationship never happened,\" she says. \"For about five months, I wasn't working with Diana, that's true. But we'd see each other every day. She wasn't allowed to say, 'Bonnie please come help me again,' and I wasn't allowed to say, 'Diana don't do this.' \"\n\nThe two still talk every day, although Nyad of late has been writing children's books and \"spending three hours or more a day on the tennis court,\" says Stoll.\n\nIs Diana Nyad as prickly and unpleasant as 'Nyad' depicts?\n\nNo one who knows Nyad disputes the fierce nature of her personality, almost a requirement for trying to accomplish the unthinkable. \"I love that we did a movie about a woman who is a 360-degree personality who is not afraid to be hungry and ambitious,\" says Vasarhelyi. \"Our film isn't about a record, it's about a woman who woke up at 60 and felt the world was done with her, but she wasn't done with the world.\"\n\nWhile Nyad certainly can be gruff and bullheaded, her longtime friend Stoll says that is just one facet of her personality that had to be dominant to power the movie.\n\n\"They did nail that part of her personality, the tough part,\" she says. \"But what you see less of is what a bright person she is, someone who speaks six languages. And she would never speak to her team disrespectfully, as the movie sometimes showed. She just had tunnel vision, which made the 40 of us going for the ride with her equally focused.\"\n\nDid Annette Bening do her own swimming in 'Nyad'?\n\nBening, 65, who embarked on the film at roughly the same age as Nyad during her successful crossing, was fully committed to the role from Day 1, say the film's co-directors. \"Annette was our secret sauce,\" says Vasarhelyi. \"She and Warren (Beatty) have a nice pool at home, and she got to it.\n\nFor a year, Bening worked on endurance and replicating Nyad's swimming form with an Olympic-caliber coach. When she showed up on the film's set in the Dominican Republic for the 37 days of in-tank water scenes, she astounded the crew.\n\n\"Annette jumped in the water tank and instantly you could see the form and strength were there,\" says Vasarhelyi. \"She ended up being able to spend between four to eight hours a day in the water, which was invaluable for the shoot. We had three stunt swimmers who basically just did water safety stuff.\" Stoll adds: \"I hear Annette now has a new hobby, and still swims daily.\"\n\nDid Annette Bening and Jodie Foster really go makeup-free in 'Nyad'?\n\nBoth Bening and Foster were adamant. \"They said, 'Our bodies cannot be touched up,' \" says Vasarhelyi. \"That was the point, the experience had to be real, and look real. Those abs on Jodie are real.\"\n\nFor most of \"Nyad,\" Bening's hair and body are sunbleached or worse, especially after scenes in which deadly box jellyfish sting her, scuttling yet another crossing attempt. The directors say neither actress wore any makeup, in keeping with the no-nonsense personalities of the women they were portraying.\n\n\"This film feels like a miracle,\" says Vasarhelyi. \"If you said you'd have these two documentary filmmakers trying to make a feature film about two older lesbians and it all takes place in water, I would not give you great odds. But it worked out because everyone was committing to doing a film that we rarely see, about older women in their full splendor and complexity.\"\n\nWhat's next from the directors of Netflix's 'Nyad'?\n\nChin and Vasarhelyi landed in the spotlight after their Oscar win for \"Free Solo,\" the story of solo climber Alex Honnold's impossible climb without ropes up a sheer face in Yosemite National Park in California. Since then, their documentary projects have included a look at the cave rescue of the Thai soccer team (2021's \"The Rescue\") and the story of conservationist Kris Tompkins (2023's \"Wild Life\").\n\nAnd while they thoroughly enjoyed jumping into the feature film world, their next endeavor is in familiar territory.\n\n\"Our next project takes us to Antartica, for a documentary with National Geographic on the amazing discovery of (British explorer Ernest) Shackleton's boat, The Endeavor,\" says Vasarhelyi. The story revolves around Shackleton's 1914 expedition, which ended a year later when the boat became trapped in ice and sank. The explorer managed to somehow get his crew to safety. Also on board for the project is British director Natalie Hewit.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/03"}]}

The move was met with particularly harsh criticism from some who noted the company's reputation for inclusiveness has helped it attract a younger, more diverse consumer base.\n\nThe boycott action comes as other groups of consumers and activists have been engaging in broader one-day boycotts against a wider array of companies, as well as Target and a separate boycott by Minnesota activists against Target, which began Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History month.\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target Fast?\n\nJamal-Harrison Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia and an activist and author, has called on the Black faith community to start a 40-day fast from shopping at Target during Lent starting on March 5, which is Ash Wednesday. The website targetfast.org has been created to offer information.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations – companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise,\" said the Targetfast.org website. \"As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity.\"\n\nThe site continued, saying Black America are \"strong consumers with astounding brand loyalty. To see companies we've supported heavily – like McDonald's Ford Motors, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart – betray our long-standing relationship is beyond disheartening.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Bryant said \"we called on a fast from Target because we believe that the company's change in position is a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"Black people, on average, spend $12 million a day at Target,\" Bryant said. \"The fact of the matter is that Target made a pledge to our community after the killing of George Floyd of $2 billion into Black business and when the administration changed, they disavowed as if it never happened. The pledge was never made under DEI or affirmative action. It was out of decency and to humanity. To walk away from it is insult to injury.\"\n\nBryant's group is calling on 100,000 Black Americans to take the pledge not to shop at Target for 40 days. So far, Bryant said 110,000 people had signed the pledge and \"legions more\" have also shared about the boycott on social media.\n\nConsumers who have signed a pledge on the website will receive a digital business directory from the Black Chamber of Commerce with 300,000 Black-owned businesses along with a 40-day prayer journal. Participants are also encouraged to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nThe action is making four demands of Target:\n\nHonor the $2 billion dollar pledge to the Black Business community by purchasing products, services, and making Black media buys. Deposit $250 million among 23 Black banks. Completely restore the retailer's commitment to DEI. Create community centers at 10 HBCU (Historically Black colleges and universities) to teach retail business at every level.\n\nThe 40 days of the fast is a benchmark and could be extended, Bryant said.\n\n\"Because Target is publicly traded, we'll be able to gauge what the economic impact of 110,000 people not going and diverting their funds in a different way,\" Bryant said. \"If the board and the CEO of Target remains steadfast, then we're committed to sojourn until there is an adjustment.\"\n\nTarget reports drop of sales in February\n\nThe 40-day fast of Target comes at a tough time for the retailer. On Tuesday during an earnings call, Target reported that its sales had dropped slightly in February. A nationwide boycott of Target by Minnesota activists protesting Target's rollback of DEI initiatives began Feb. 1 and another consumer group had a broader one-day economic blackout on Feb. 28.\n\n\"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year,\" Target said in a press release. Company CEO Brian Cornell also warned that prices could increase within days, due to new tariffs imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTarget has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment about boycotts against the retailer.\n\nFoot traffic has dropped at Target, according to one firm. Placer.ai, uses a panel of tens of millions of devices and utilizes machine learning to make estimations for in-store visits to locations across the country.\n\nFoot traffic at Target, Walmart, Best Buy, McDonalds and Starbucks fell for the month of February compared to January. Target's decline in foot traffic was the largest with a 9% drop, compared to a 3.6% increase in January. That was followed by an 8.7% drop for McDonald's, which was up 2.1% in January.\n\nWalmart's foot traffic dropped in February by 5.8% compared to a 3.0% increase in January, while Best Buy's foot traffic dropped 6.8% in February compared to a 0.4% increase in January.\n\nCostco, which has seen some extra support from some consumers after its board of directors voted down an effort to drop diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, had an increase in foot traffic in February of 2.2%, following an increase of 7.9% in January.\n\n“Placer.ai’s data reveals that many retailers experienced year-over-year declines in weekly visits throughout February 2025, driven by post-holiday spending pullbacks, decreased consumer confidence, economic and tariff uncertainty, and unseasonably cold weather,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told USA TODAY.\n\nJoseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group, in a note to clients last week, said the Placer.ai data regarding Target’s foot traffic “shows a clear drop in traffic in late January into mid-February following the company’s step back from DEI.”\n\nFeldman said that while other retailers have also reported a slower start to February, Target has become particularly susceptible to the boycott actions, on top of worries about consumer confidence and increases in prices due to tariffs.\n\n\"I do think that you could make some connection that they're getting hit with all this chatter on social media among a big cohort of their customer base,\" Feldman told USA TODAY.\n\nCould the boycott against Target work?\n\nIt makes sense that Target is being targeted because \"in 2020, Target specifically ramped up their DEI efforts in the wake of the George Floyd murder because it was in Minneapolis and their base is there,'' said Diane Merians Penaloza, doctoral lecturer in the Online Business Programs at City University of New York School of Professional Studies. \" They took it very personally and there was a reaction, which was they saw a huge increase in revenue.\"\n\nTarget's market share for Black consumers is around 18% and its core audience is millennials at around 38%, Merians Penaloza told USA TODAY. Those two groups tend to shop companies that align with their beliefs, she said, “so Target eliminating their DEI efforts takes them out of alignment with their core audience. This is something that can do some serious damage to the revenue in the long run.”\n\nBecause Target took such a significant stance on DEI efforts, the retreat from them “almost feels like it’s a personal afront in many ways,” Merians Penaloza said.\n\nTarget is also under additional pressure from tariffs and shrinking consumer demand, she said.\n\nWhat other boycotts are planned?\n\nThe 40-day fast is one of several planned by different groups. A national boycott of Target started Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History Month. It was launched by civil rights activists in Minneapolis who were upset that Target has rolled back its DEI programs.\n\nAnother boycott that lasts through the end of the year was outlined on Instagram by comedian and actress Leslie Jones. It encourages consumers to buy directly from Black-owned businesses and outlines planned protests in certain months against Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe Latino community has also been active on social media using the hashtag #LatinoFreeze, encouraging supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, reduced funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network also have held a few \"buy-cotts\" to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company's board of directors, which voted down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nThe National Action Network also said in a news release that it would lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThe People's Union USA, an organization started by John Swartz, who organized the Feb. 28 one-day blackout, has since expanded its boycotting efforts. It includes boycotts of various companies and retailers during different time periods including Amazon (March 7-14), Nestle (March 21-28), Walmart (April 7-14) and a second broader one-day economic blackout on April 18, which may be expanded to a weekend-long event, Swartz has said, among others. A website, thepeoplesunionusa.com, has more information on the group's efforts.\n\nDo boycotts work?\n\nBoycotts can have mixed results.\n\nConservative activists have successfully rallied in recent years to force retailers and companies to rein in their DEI efforts by staging boycotts to hurt sales.\n\nProfessors have previously told USA TODAY that boycotts can be successful in shaming a company into reversing decisions or taking action, but they don't always work. There needs to be clear demands outlined, they say. But consumers do like being able to take action against something they feel strongly about.\n\nThe Feb. 28 one-day economic blackout was interesting because it was coming from so many different audiences simultaneously, but Merians Penaloza said she is unsure if it had any real impact, other than a symbolic one.\n\n“I think that an entire community of people getting together and saying ‘We’re not going to shop for 40 days this brand’ is impactful,” she said. “It will expand outside of just that audience and everybody who is sympathetic to that audience is also going to participate, so it has the ability to make a bigger impact.\n\nThe outcome will also depend however on the action getting lots of public and media attention, Merians Penaloza said.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Amazon, Walmart economic blackout ...", "text": "A 40-day boycott against Target began March 5, 2025 and is expected to last until April 17, 2025.\n\nIn response to Target's DEI reversal, some shoppers are boycotting the retailer.\n\nAdditional boycotts to Amazon and Walmart are planned later.\n\nSome Indiana Target stores might see fewer shoppers in March and April from customers upset over major corporations who have backtracked on their DEI or diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nA 40-day boycott against Target kicked off Wednesday after a nationwide 24-hour economic blackout. More boycotts are planned against Amazon and Walmart in the coming days.\n\nHere's what we know about it.\n\nWho is leading the Target boycott?\n\nThe consumer spending pause, led by Atlanta Pastor Jamal Bryant, encourages shoppers to refrain from purchasing anything from Target during the \"40-day fast\" to coincide with the start of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting and prayer leading up to Easter.\n\nWhy has Target been singled out for a boycott?\n\nBryant named several major retailers — Walmart, McDonald's and Amazon — who have rolled back DEI policies but said they chose to Target in part because it's headquartered in Minneapolis, the same city where police officers killed George Floyd.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target boycott about?\n\nBryant and other Black faith leaders have voiced their frustration with Target, they said, for reneging on a $2 billion promise to invest in Black-owned companies by the end of 2025.\n\n\"When George Floyd was killed, Target came out and made an announcement that they're going to invest $2 billion into Black business,\" Bryant said Wednesday during an interview on The Breakfast Club.\n\n\"When Trump made the announcement of January 2025, (Target) dishonored their commitment,\" Bryant said, alluding to President Donald Trump's threats in January the federal government would investigate corporations with DEI programs.\n\nWithin two days of Trump threatening legal action, Target announced it was ending its Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiatives, under which it had pledged to invest $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, as well as add more than 500 Black-owned brands and a funding program from its in-house media company.\n\nIn addition to boycotting Target, investors have been asked to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nDid the Feb. 28 boycott work?\n\nAccording to Forbes, several retailers including Walmart and Amazon, saw a slight dip in web traffic during the 24-hour Economic Blackout last week, but Target was hit hardest with a 9% drop. Meanwhile, the publication says that Costco, which stood by its DEI initiatives, experienced a boost in web traffic of 22%.\n\nTrump's tariffs could also harm Target, lead to increased prices for shoppers\n\nTarget's recent earnings report indicated a \"decline in February net sales.\" Along with consumer uncertainty, the company says tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will yield more \"profit pressure\" and warns shoppers to expect price hikes on certain goods, such as fruits and vegetables.\n\nHow long is the Target boycott?\n\nThe no-spend period began Wednesday, March 5, and will continue for 40 days to align with Lent, which takes place March 5-April 17, 2025. The NAACP urged customers to instead support Black businesses as well as businesses that maintain its DEI programs.\n\nHow many Target stores are in Indiana?\n\nThere are upwards of 32 Target locations in Indiana, according to the retailer's official website, including two in Carmel, five in Indianapolis and three in Fort Wayne.\n\nAvon\n\nAvon: 10209 E US Highway 36.\n\nBloomington\n\nCarmel\n\nClarksville\n\nWaterford Park: 1125 Veterans Pkwy.\n\nColumbus\n\nColumbus: 1865 N National Rd.\n\nEvansville\n\nFishers\n\nFishers: 11750 Commercial Dr.\n\nFort Wayne\n\nGoshen\n\nGoshen: 3938 Midway Rd.\n\nGranger\n\nMishawaka: 155 University Dr E.\n\nGreenwood\n\nGreenwood South: 895 S State Rd 135\n\nHighland\n\nHighland: 10451 Indianapolis Blvd.\n\nIndianapolis\n\nKokomo\n\nKokomo: 1037 S Reed Rd.\n\nLafayette\n\nMerrillville\n\nLake County: 2661 E US Highway 30.\n\nMuncie\n\nMuncie: 3601 N Barr St.\n\nMunster\n\nMunster: 8005 Calumet Ave\n\nNew Albany\n\nNew Albany: 2209 State St.\n\nPlainfield\n\nPlainfield: 2673 E Main St.\n\nSaint John\n\nSaint John: 9885 Wicker Ave.\n\nSouth Bend\n\nSouth Bend: 1400 E Ireland Rd.\n\nValparaiso\n\nValparaiso: 2420 Laporte Ave.\n\nWest Lafayette\n\nWest Lafayette State Street: 300 W State St.\n\nAre more boycotts planned?\n\nYes.

The boycott started Feb. 1 in response to the Target's decision to phase out DEI initiatives. It is an indefinite boycott until Target changes its actions, said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network.\n\nThe DEI retreat \"really felt like a slap in the face,\" Levy Armstrong told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Target was a beloved community that seemed to build its model around embracing diversity and being intentionally inclusive of having Black brands on the shelves, having beautiful Black History Month displays. For them to essentially bow down to the mandates of the Trump administration was unacceptable,\" she said.\n\nThe boycott coincides with Black History Month. Organizers, which include several other civil rights organizations in Minnesota, have also since encouraged consumers to support Black-owned brands in Target by buying directly from the businesses' websites after some Black-owned businesses expressed concern about the boycott.\n\nLevy Armstrong said the support of the boycott has been good, and she sees other boycotts planned against Target and other companies as \"complementary.\" Her groups' efforts for now will be focused on Target, she said.\n\n\"People feel empowered in a moment in which they felt powerless and somewhat helpless,\" she said.\n\nMore consumer boycotts planned\n\nAt least two other consumer boycotts are planned.\n\nComedian and actress Leslie Jones announced on her Instagram account planned boycotts and buying actions starting in February and continuing through the end of the year.

A Walmart spokesperson declined comment.\n\nWhich California companies are being boycotted?\n\nCalifornia's fast food staple, In-n-Out, has been targeted again by boycotts due to the former CEO's past donations to the president's and other Republican candidate campaigns. The company has about 280 locations in California alone.\n\nOther California companies that have been named in the boycotts are:\n\nTesla\n\nGoogle\n\nMeta\n\nCoca-Cola is another big company that has faced social media backlash after a rumor spread that it was assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. However, no such evidence has been verified, and as of 4 p.m. Friday, the company has yet to release a statement.\n\nThe list of companies that are not California-based but have a large presence in the state include:\n\nHome Depot\n\nChick-fil-A\n\nHobby Lobby\n\nTarget\n\nWalmart\n\nAmazon\n\nBoycotts can be successful, but for different reasons\n\nBoycotts can be pretty effective, but not in the way that consumers think, said Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe boycotts create attention for the cause, including from the media, which \"puts a negative spotlight on the companies they're boycotting and that could in the long run have reputational consequences,\" King told USA TODAY.\n\n\"What boycotts don't seem to do is have much of an impact on consumer behavior,\" King said.\n\nConsumers can usually handle a boycott for a day, \"but over longer periods of time, most boycotts don't have any kind of impact on sales.\"\n\nThat's because consumer purchasing, especially for online shopping, \"tends to occur in private where others can't see or judge them.\"\n\nKing said a boycott of Bud Light in 2023, sparked by conservative consumers upset that the beer maker had teamed up with a transgender influencer, was successful because of a couple key reasons.\n\nPeople tend to consume beer in public, so they could be held accountable, King said. There also were easy substitutes of other beer brands that consumers participating in the boycott could choose instead.\n\nConsumers can express their voice through a boycott\n\nStill, a boycott can be a positive way for consumers to express themselves through action, King said.\n\n\"Saying you're going to boycott something does feel like you're casting a vote that you hope makes a difference down the road,\" he said. It is a way for people upset about the Trump administration's actions or companies' responses to DEI initiatives, \"to convert grievances into action,\" King said.\n\nToo many protest actions can cause confusion\n\nThere are also several social media messages that outline other boycott efforts in different time frames against specific retailers. That is usually \"one of the biggest difficulties activists face, which is they're not just competing with all the other events and things that are happening with the world, but also competing with each other and for attention,\" said King.\n\nThe most successful boycotts are ones where \"there's a lot of unity among the various strands of people who count themselves...in that camp,\" he said.\n\nShopping in support of a business can also work\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network have recently taken action at two Costco locations in New York City and Union, New Jersey to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company board of director's actions to vote down an effort to drop DEI efforts.\n\nNational Action Network also said in a press release about the \"buy-cott\" efforts that it will lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Last year, Target scaled back its Pride collection and did not carry the collection in all stores.\n\nA growing number of companies have retreated on DEI commitments as those efforts come under greater scrutiny in a rapidly changing legal and political climate.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump ordered federal agencies to crack down on DEI and investigate the DEI programs of private companies.\n\nNow Target and other companies find themselves under attack from the other side, facing calls for boycotts from DEI supporters angry over the rollbacks.\n\nThat's an increasingly common dilemma for corporations − and one of their own making, said David Primo, professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. He blames years of \"haphazard policymaking\" by companies on contentious issues like DEI.\n\n“Companies need to figure out what they will take positions on, what they won’t take positions on, and then stand firm,\" Primo said. \"Holding your finger to the political winds is not an effective way to run a company in a polarized world.”\n\nWhat is the Feb. 28 consumer economic blackout?\n\nIn one of several videos about the Feb. 28 blackout, the Instagram handle \"TheOneCalledJai\" said the day of economic resistance is to show that \"we the people are the system.\"\n\n\"For decades, they have told us that we are powerless, that we have no control, and that this system is too big, too strong, too unshakable.\n\n\"We are going to remind them who has the power.

It is a way for people upset about the Trump administration's actions or companies' responses to DEI initiatives \"to convert grievances into action.\"\n\nToo many protest actions can cause confusion\n\nThere are also several social media messages that outline other boycott efforts in different time frames against specific retailers. That is usually \"one of the biggest difficulties activists face, which is they're not just competing with all the other events and things that are happening with the world, but also competing with each other and for attention,\" King said.\n\nThe most successful boycotts are ones where \"there's a lot of unity among the various strands of people who count themselves ... in that camp.\"\n\nShopping in support of a business can also work\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network have recently taken action at two Costco locations in New York City and in Union, New Jersey, to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company board of director's actions to vote down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nNational Action Network also said in a news release about the \"buy-cott\" that it will lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

The shift attracted particularly harsh criticism from some who noted the company's reputation for inclusiveness has helped it attract a younger, more diverse consumer base.\n\nThe boycott action comes as other groups of consumers and activists have been engaging in broader one-day boycotts against a wider array of companies, as well as Target and a separate boycott by Minnesota activists against Target, which began Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History month.\n\nHere's what we know about the Target boycott.\n\nWhat is an 'economic blackout'? Why people in Texas are boycotting businesses for 24 hours\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target Fast? What to know about the national boycott\n\nThe national Target boycott is led by Black faith leaders like Jamal-Harrison Bryant, who are urging members of their congregation to protest the rollback on DEI initiatives.\n\nBryant is a senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia as well as an activist and author. He has called on the Black faith community to start a \"40-day fast\" from shopping at Target. The period coincides with Lent, which began on March 6 and continues through April 20.\n\nMore information about the boycott can be found at the website targetfast.org.\n\n\"In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations – companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise,\" Targetfast.org states. \"As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity.\"\n\nThe site continued, saying Black America are \"strong consumers with astounding brand loyalty. To see companies we've supported heavily — like McDonald's Ford Motors, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart — betray our long-standing relationship is beyond disheartening.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Bryant said \"we called on a fast from Target because we believe that the company's change in position is a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"Black people, on average, spend $12 million a day at Target,\" Bryant said. \"The fact of the matter is that Target made a pledge to our community after the killing of George Floyd of $2 billion into Black business and when the administration changed, they disavowed as if it never happened. The pledge was never made under DEI or affirmative action. It was out of decency and to humanity. To walk away from it is insult to injury.\"\n\nBryant's group is calling on 100,000 Black Americans to take the pledge not to shop at Target for 40 days.So far, Bryant said 110,000 people had signed the pledge and \"legions more\" have also shared about the boycott on social media.\n\nConsumers who have signed a pledge on the website will receive a digital business directory from the Black Chamber of Commerce with 300,000 Black-owned businesses along with a 40-day prayer journal. Participants are also encouraged to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nThe action is making four demands of Target:\n\nHonor the $2 billion dollar pledge to the Black Business community by purchasing products, services, and making Black media buys. Deposit $250 million among 23 Black banks. Completely restore the retailer's commitment to DEI. Create community centers at 10 HBCU (Historically Black colleges and universities) to teach retail business at every level.\n\nThe 40 days of the fast is a benchmark and could be extended, Bryant said.\n\n\"Because Target is publicly traded, we'll be able to gauge what the economic impact of 110,000 people not going and diverting their funds in a different way,\" Bryant said. \"If the board and the CEO of Target remains steadfast, then we're committed to sojourn until there is an adjustment.\"\n\nTarget reports drop of sales in February after change in DEI policy\n\nThe 40-day fast of Target comes at a tough time for the retailer. On Tuesday during an earnings call, Target reported that its sales had dropped slightly in February. A nationwide boycott of Target by Minnesota activists protesting Target's rollback of DEI initiatives began Feb. 1, and another consumer group had a broader one-day economic blackout on Feb. 28.\n\n\"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year,\" Target said in a press release. Company CEO Brian Cornell also warned that prices could increase within days, due to new tariffs imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTarget has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment about boycotts against the retailer.\n\nCould the boycott against Target work?\n\nIt makes sense that Target is being targeted because \"in 2020, Target specifically ramped up their DEI efforts in the wake of the George Floyd murder because it was in Minneapolis and their base is there,'' said Diane Merians Penaloza, doctoral lecturer in the Online Business Programs at City University of New York School of Professional Studies. \" They took it very personally and there was a reaction, which was they saw a huge increase in revenue.\"\n\nTarget's market share for Black consumers is around 18% and its core audience is millennials at around 38%, Merians Penaloza told USA TODAY. Those two groups tend to shop companies that align with their beliefs, she said, “so Target eliminating their DEI efforts takes them out of alignment with their core audience. This is something that can do some serious damage to the revenue in the long run.”\n\nBecause Target took such a significant stance on DEI efforts, the retreat from them “almost feels like it’s a personal afront in many ways,” Merians Penaloza said.\n\nTarget is also under additional pressure from tariffs and shrinking consumer demand, she said.\n\nHow many Targets does Texas have?\n\nTexas has the second-highest number of Target stores among states, according to ScrapeHero. With 157 locations, Texas is home to 8% of all U.S. stores. California claims 318, or 16% of stores.\n\nWhat other boycotts are planned? See list\n\nThe 40-day fast is one of several planned by different groups. A national boycott of Target started Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History Month. It was launched by civil rights activists in Minneapolis who were upset that Target has rolled back its DEI programs.\n\nAnother boycott that lasts through the end of the year was outlined on Instagram by comedian and actress Leslie Jones. It encourages consumers to buy directly from Black-owned businesses and outlines planned protests in certain months against Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe Latino community has also been active on social media using the hashtag #LatinoFreeze, encouraging supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, reduced funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network also have held a few \"buy-cotts\" to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company's board of directors, which voted down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nThe National Action Network also said in a news release that it would lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThe People's Union USA, an organization started by John Swartz, who organized the Feb. 28 one-day blackout, has since expanded its boycotting efforts. It includes boycotts of various companies and retailers over different weeks:\n\nAmazon: March 7 - 14\n\nNestle: March 21-28\n\nWalmart: April 7 - 14\n\nAnother broad one-day economic blackout, like the one on Feb. 28, is planned for April 18 — which may be extended through the weekend, Swartz said.\n\nMore information on the group's efforts can be found at the website thepeoplesunionusa.com.\n\nHow effective are boycotts?\n\nBoycotts can have mixed results.\n\nConservative activists have successfully rallied in recent years to force retailers and companies to rein in their DEI efforts by staging boycotts to hurt sales.\n\nProfessors have previously told USA TODAY that boycotts can be successful in shaming a company into reversing decisions or taking action, but they don't always work. There needs to be clear demands outlined, they say. But consumers do like being able to take action against something they feel strongly about.\n\nThe Feb. 28 one-day economic blackout was interesting because it was coming from so many different audiences simultaneously, but Merians Penaloza said she is unsure if it had any real impact, other than a symbolic one.\n\n“I think that an entire community of people getting together and saying ‘We’re not going to shop for 40 days this brand’ is impactful,” she said. “It will expand outside of just that audience and everybody who is sympathetic to that audience is also going to participate, so it has the ability to make a bigger impact.\n\nThe outcome will also depend, however, on the action getting lots of public and media attention, Merians Penaloza said.\n\n— USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/22/boycott-over-dei-rollback-against-target-walmart-amazon-2025/79075610007/", "title": "Why are people boycotting Target? DEI protests planned", "text": "A group has organized a set of boycotts to protest the world they live in.\n\nThe People's Union USA has organized three, 24-hour spending blackout days and a 40-day boycott on Target, dubbed as the Target fast. It will happen coincide with the 40 days of Lent.\n\nThe first 24-hour spending blackout is set to happen on Feb. 28.\n\nThe move was organized and advertised by The People's Union USA, an emerging grassroots organization that since 2020 has been organizing actions of economic resistance seeking better government accountability and corporate practices.\n\nIn recent weeks, its founder, New Yorker John Schwarz, has complained about oligarchy, Elon Musk, and the rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts after President Donald Trump ended them.\n\n\"How did we get to a point in this country where one billionaire -- one billionaire -- has more control over our government, our infrastructure and our economy than most politicians do?\" he asked in an Instagram post.\n\nWill boycotting work?\n\nBoycotts are centuries-old forms of protests.\n\nHistorically, they have lead to social justice reforms, such as the sugar boycott by British abolitionists in the late 18th century helped raise awareness and put economic pressure on the sugar industry produced by enslaved people.\n\nOr the Montgomery Bus boycott in Alabama in the 1950's, which became a key incendiary action for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nWhen it comes to economic pressure, it all depends on how many people religiously stick to the boycott. The boycott of Starbucks in the midst of the war against Palestine could be the reason why in Jan. 2024 the company posted quarterly sales of $190 million less than what it had projected, Daria Shevchenko, CMO of marketing platform Snov.io told Newsweek.\n\n\"If we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,\" The People's Union USA wrote on its website.\n\nBut people on social media are saying boycotts should last longer.\n\nIn an Instagram video, Influencer @DanishaCarter, said that \"Staging a boycott with an announcement that it ends three days or a week later just tells the company that they need to move around the budget for the next three days.\"\n\nBut say no more. A pastor from Atlanta is calling for a 40-day boycott of Target, a company that showed no hesitation in rolling back its DEI initiatives by the end of January.\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target fast?\n\nBlack faith leaders have encouraged pastors to rally their congregations on Sunday to participate in a 40-day boycott of Target starting on March 5, Ash Wednesday, as part of an effort to oppose companies abandoning DEI initiatives.\n\n“We've got to tell corporate America that there's a consequence for turning their back on diversity,\" said Bishop Reginald T. Jackson. “So let us send the message that if corporate America can't stand with us, we're not going to stand with corporate America.”\n\nThe 40-day movement against Target formed when more than 50,000 people signed a petition against the retail giant, initiated by Atlanta-based New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Jamal Bryant.\n\n\"Black people spend on average $12 million a day in Target,\" said Pastor Bryant. \"Historically, the Black church has always been the centerpiece of the civil rights movement. If they start losing $29 million a day for 40 days, we will break the back of the system,\" he told local station WAGA-TV in Atlanta.\n\nIn addition to scaling back DEI initiatives, Target faced backlash for removing Pride displays in rural stores due to conservative opposition in recent years.\n\nWhen are the boycott dates?\n\n40-day boycott of Target: March 5 to April 13\n\n24-hour spending blackout: Feb. 28, March 28 and April 18\n\nAmazon Blackout: March 7 to 14\n\nWalmart Blackout: April 7 to 13\n\nWhich companies are continuing to support DEI initiatives?\n\nApple: Apple's shareholders voted against a proposal to cease DEI initiatives. The company rejected the proposal and responded that \"we strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"\n\nMicrosoft: \"For Microsoft, transparency and accountability are not a trend or a season\" chief diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre posted on LinkedIn.\n\nDelta Air Lines: On a January earnings call, when asked if the company was going to rescind DEI efforts, Chief External Affairs Officer Peter Carter said \"No, we are not. We are steadfast in our commitments because we think that they're critical to our business.\"\n\nCostco: Its board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject a motion against DEI practices. The board said “our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\" per AP.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty: \"So many dicks\" is the name of the cosmetics brand campaign embracing DEI initiatives. It calls for more diverse boardrooms and more women in C-Suites positions.\n\nProcter & Gamble: The company that manages brands like Charmin, Tide, and Tampax released a statement to The Cincinnati Enquirer in February, emphasizing that equality and inclusion are beneficial for business. \"This cannot and will not change,\" said CEO Jon Moeller. \"It's critical to who we are and what we do, to our principles, values, and purpose and most importantly to winning.\"\n\nSephora: The beauty brand introduced its first film, Beauty & Belonging, at the Sundance Film Festival in January, celebrating diversity and authenticity.\n\nHere's a list of companies rolling back DEI\n\nHere's a list of companies rolling back their DEI initiatives as per multiple news outlets and statements from the companies themselves.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/27/why-are-people-boycotting-shopping-friday-feb-28-what-to-know-economic-blackout-consumer-boycott/80699007007/", "title": "Why are people boycotting shopping on Friday?

For one day, we turn it off for one day. We shut it down for one day. We remind them that this country does not belong to the elite, it belongs to the people and this will work,\" the Instagram video said.\n\nWhat other boycotts have been planned?\n\nThe one-day action has since been expanded by The People's Union, the organization Schwarz started, USA TODAY reported, and includes boycotts of various companies and retailers during different time periods including Amazon (March 7-14), Nestle (March 21-28), Walmart (April 7-14) and a second broader one-day economic blackout on April 18.\n\nTarget is also facing an indefinite boycott after phasing out its DEI initiatives. Minnesota civil rights activists encouraged consumers to stop shopping at the major retailer until it changes it policies, said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network.\n\nLatinos are also being encouraged to freeze spending in response to freezes on DEI policies, funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.

I said 'This is not real, is it?'\" said Ferreira, who said he did a double take upon catching Lagasse's reflection in the mirror as he went about his daily routine of preparing coffee.\n\nA sweet start at Europa Pastries\n\nWhile there, Ferreira said Lagasse educated his colleagues on Portuguese traditions and culture of the Fall River area. Ferreira, his sister Erica Couto and her husband, Kevin, then chatted with him about the pastries their bakery is most known for.\n\nSo it's no surprise Lagasse's Europa order included their award-winning pastel de nata, or Portuguese custard cup.\n\nAccording to Ferreira, Lagasse wasn't at Europa very long, taking his treats to go, but he made a lasting impression on staff and customers all the same.\n\n\"It was brief, but it was enough to be star-struck and in awe that he was here,\" said Ferreira, who grew up watching Lagasse's TV show \"Emeril Live!\" every day and emulating the city-born chef.\n\n\"He was super nice. Anyone that came up to him he would speak to,\" Ferreira said. \"He's definitely considered a hometown hero for a lot of those people.\"\n\nTaste of Portugal at Sagres\n\nA bit further up the cobblestoned sidewalks of Columbia Street, Lagasse and his crew dined that same day at Sagres Restaurant, well-known for its upscale, authentic Portuguese cuisine.\n\nVictor DaSilva and his brother Manuel Ferreira, co-owners of the decades-old city staple, got a heads up about a week ago about Lagasse's visit.\n\n\"Somebody called in a reservation for Emeril Lagasse and we thought it was a joke,\" said DaSilva, whose disbelief dissipated as Emeril's table of six walked in the door.\n\nThe superstar chef sought a sampling of traditional Portuguese food and wines, leaving it up to DaSilva and Ferreira to order up an array of their most-loved entrees and appetizers.\n\nLagasse's Luso buffet at Sagres included shrimp and littleneck appetizers, followed by grilled octopus, one of Sagres' best sellers.\n\nThe spread also featured two types of cod fish dishes — baked cod (bacalhau) and Bacalhau a Gomes de Sa — Carne de Porco a Alentejana (marinated pork sautéed with littlenecks and potatoes) and Sagres' signature sirloin steak, the best measure of any good Portuguese eatery.\n\nAs with any customer who comes into his restaurant, DaSilva said \"you always worry about making sure everything goes right,\" but he wouldn't call the experience nerve-wracking.\n\n\"They were really cool, very nice people,\" said DaSilva, whose restaurant has recently drawn other familiar faces such as former Patriots players Rob Ninkovich and Matt Light. \"They said they loved the food, they loved Fall River, they loved the people … and that they'd love to return.\"\n\nAfter their meal, the brothers shared a table with Lagasse, where they discussed the joys and challenges of the restaurant industry.\n\n\"I told him the people of Fall River are very proud of him,\" DaSilva said. \"He's a big ambassador for the city, and in this case Portuguese food as well.\"\n\nAccording to DaSilva, Lagasse was most gracious to the room full of excited customers and staff who exchanged words and took photos with the Fall River icon.\n\n\"He was very friendly. I think he felt like he was around his people here,\" said DaSilva, noting that some customers reminisced about how they knew his family.\n\nWhat other Fall River-area spots did Emeril visit?\n\nLagasse's Sunday stops also included Portas Da Cidade Restaurant and Lounge in Westport, which shared a photo of their encounter with the memorable patron on Facebook.\n\n\"It was an honor and privilege to have Chef Emeril Lagasse and his team dine with us this afternoon. Chefs Ruben, Joe, and Emanuel made sure that everything is top notch as usual,\" read the Westport eatery's post.\n\nOn Monday, Lagasse continued his tour of Fall River hotspots by dining at the T.A. Restaurant on South Main Street, enjoying some Azorean cuisine and taking photos with restaurant managers. He also hit up Nick's Hot Dogs for a quick bite and visited Portugalia Marketplace, which has been host to numerous TV food shows and distinguished chefs over the years.\n\n\"He left us by saying, 'It’s not goodbye, it’s see you soon,’\" read a Facebook post by the Twelfth Street shop.\n\nLagasse's multi-day stretch of restaurant hopping in Greater Fall River also included several other local businesses, who shared photos with their special guest. Lagasse was spotted at Fall River's Caldeiras Restaurant, Mee Sum Chinese restaurant, Mello's Chourico and Linguica and Sarmento's Imports, as well as Saraiva Enterprises in New Bedford.\n\nFall River strong: From Rhodes scholars to MMA fighters, 10 notable city natives\n\nEmeril’s Fall River roots\n\nBorn in Fall River in 1959, Lagasse worked his way up from the kitchens of Fall River to kitchens all over the world.\n\nAn alumnus of Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School's culinary arts program, he started out washing pans at Carreiros Barcelos bakery on Bedford Street and cut his teeth at places like the Quequechan Club and St. John's Athletic Club in Fall River, as well as Venus de Milo in Swansea.\n\nHe went on to attend Johnson & Wales University in Providence, which set him on a path to an impressive culinary career spanning 33 years.\n\nHis famous New Orleans restaurant Emeril’s has spawned more than 20 restaurants nationwide. The celebrity chef has also hosted multiple award-winning TV cooking shows where he rode a catchphrase craze to national fame (“Bam,” “kick it up a notch,” “pork fat rules”), written cookbooks, and even played himself in a sitcom.\n\nSouthCoast serving as inspiration for new restaurant\n\nLagasse's newest addition to his restaurant portfolio — the reason for his SouthCoast trip — will be named 34 Restaurant & Bar.\n\nThe number name reflects that father and son are the 3rd and 4th Emeril Lagasses. The celebrity chef's father was Emeril Jr.\n\nThe New Orleans restaurant, which he is planning with his son, 21-year-old chef E.J. Lagasse, will serve as a love letter to their Portuguese heritage.\n\nWith Providence Journal reports.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/30/covid-cases-states-pausing-reopening-plans-list/3284513001/", "title": "At least 22 states pause reopening or take new steps to limit the ...", "text": "The nation reached yet another bleak milestone Wednesday, surpassing 3,000,000 coronavirus cases — roughly a quarter of the world's cases and its deaths.\n\nGovernors and other state leaders continue to grapple with plans to reopen their economies – or slow them down again – after a Fourth of July weekend where celebrations ignoring social distancing guidelines led the news. Among measures on the table: shutting down high-capacity businesses such as bars and gyms, halting elective surgeries and requiring people to wear masks.\n\nMap: Take a look at coronavirus trends, reopening status and mobility\n\nHere is a look at which states have paused their reopening or taken other steps. This list is continually updated.\n\nArizona\n\nGov. Doug Ducey issued an executive order requiring bars, gyms, theaters and water parks to shut down June 29. The order follows mounting pressure to respond to ballooning COVID-19 numbers that followed his accelerated reopening plan, which he announced in May.\n\n\"Arizonans have been, by and large, terrific, fantastic and responsible,\" the governor said. \"But, we have found some situations in categories where we need to take more aggressive actions, and that's what we're going to do today.\"\n\nArizona reported over 3,500 new COVID-19 cases and 36 additional deaths July 8. The day prior, the state reported 117 new deaths — the highest number of deaths reported so far.\n\nThe state has reported a total of 108,614 cases.\n\n– Maria Polletta and Rachel Leingang, Arizona Republic\n\nArkansas\n\nNearly two weeks after moving into phase two, which allowed for two-thirds capacity in restaurants and other businesses, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he's not ready to ease restrictions further as the state experiences a spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe state has recorded over 25,000 confirmed cases, over 5,500 which are currently active. The number of new cases on July 8, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, was the second-highest since the outbreak began.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAs California faces an explosion of new COVID-19 cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered 19 counties — including Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara — to shut down businesses with indoor operations for three weeks. That includes theaters, wineries, museums and restaurants.\n\nAs of July 8, California has reported 289,468 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The state set an all-time single-day high on that day, with 11,694 cases — that includes a considerable backlog from Los Angeles County.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware did not move into phase three of its economic reopening on June 29. The announcement, issuedby Gov. John Carney, postponed official action until this week so officials \"can get a better handle on what’s going on in Delaware and around the country.\"\n\n“Too many Delawareans and visitors are not following basic public health precautions,\" Carney said.\n\nAt the end of June, he also announced restrictions on parking at state beaches, as well as face covering requirements in public areas at the beach prior to the Fourth of July weekend. Those restrictions remain in place.\n\nThe state reported 12,414 total cases as of July 7, with 514 deaths.\n\n– Jeff Neiburg and Meredith Newman, Delaware News Journal\n\nFlorida\n\nThe number of COVID-19 cases in Florida surpassed 220,000. On June 26, the state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation announced it would suspend on-premise consumption of alcohol at bars statewide. Bars will still be able to serve drinks in to-go containers.\n\nHalsey Beshears, the department's secretary, said the action was taken because of an increase in COVID-19 cases and noncompliance by some businesses. Restaurants that serve alcohol will be allowed to stay open. However, Gov. Ron DeSantis has not rolled back any other reopening plans.\n\n– Jane Musgrave and Olivia Hitchcock, Palm Beach Post; Rachael Thomas, Treasure Coast Newsapers; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News\n\nIdaho\n\nGov. Brad Little announced that the state will remain in phase four of its reopening process through at least July 10 after a nearly monthlong spike in COVID-19 cases. Phase four allows visits to senior living facilities and corrections facilities, and it lets nightclubs and sporting venues open with limited capacity. It is the last stage before full reopening.\n\nThe state has reached a total of over 7,800 confirmed and probable cases as of July 7. It set a new single-day record of 448 new cases July 7.\n\nIndiana\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb announced a new stage of reopening will begin July 4.\n\nStage 4.5 will temporarily pause increases in capacity at restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, among others.\n\n\"This virus is on the prowl,\" Holcomb said. \"In some places it's gaining momentum. It's not slowing down.\"\n\nThe new stage is set to last through July 17. Under the governor's initial five-phase plan to reopen the state, Stage Five was set to begin in most of the state on July 4.\n\n– Ethan May, Indianapolis Star\n\nKansas\n\nGov. Laura Kelly signed an executive order that mandates masks in public spaces statewide in order to deal with an upward trend in new coronavirus cases.\n\nAlthough Kelly’s mask mandate will require anyone in a public space where social distancing is not possible to wear a mask, counties have the ability to fight the order and not enforce it.\n\nThe mandate follows a recommendation June 22 that communities remain in phase three of reopening, which allows bars, nightclubs and personal care facilities such as nail salons and barber shops to remain open with reduced capacity. However, the governor cannot enforce this statewide.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment has reported 17,618 positive COVID-19 cases as of July 8. The agency has reported 282 deaths.\n\n– India Yarborough and Brianna Childers, The Topeka Capital-Journal\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana is approaching nearly 70,000 total coronavirus cases as the state's hospitalizations and ventilator use continued to rise. Officials reported a single-day COVID case surge of nearly 2,000 June 8, the fifth-highest total of the pandemic, while hospitalizations topped 1,000 for the first time since May 19.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards issued a 28-day order June 23 to keep the state in phase two of reopening. That allows restaurants, malls, gyms, theaters, museums, bars and other businesses to operate at 50% capacity.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is we're not getting better; we're getting worse,\" Edwards said. \"Before it gets out of control we have to get better compliance.\"\n\nHe also asked Louisianans to avoid large groups and remain home on the Fourth of July Holiday. He traces the origin of Louisiana's summer surge in cases and hospitalizations to Memorial Day.\n\n– Greg Hilburn, Monroe News-Star\n\nMaine\n\nA week after Gov. Janet Mills indefinitely postponed the resumption of indoor bar service, she issued a mandate requiring restaurants, stores and other businesses in the city's southern and coastal regions to enforce mask-wearing.\n\nAccording to the Portland Press Herald, Mills said that was necessary to deal with an uptick in cases in those areas after \"they lifted restrictions dramatically.\"\n\nMore venues in the state, including movie theaters and museums, reopened July 1 as part of its third phase of reopening, with a 50-person cap and a checklist of requirements.\n\nAs of July 8, the state has registered a total of 3,460 cases and 110 deaths. No new deaths were reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer on July 1 closed indoor bar service in south and central Michigan, saying it's needed to control an increase in the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nOnly in the northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula can indoor bar service remain open.\n\nThe governor also signed a package of bills allowing cocktails-to-go at bars and restaurants, which she said would help these businesses serve more Michiganders.\n\n– Paul Egan, Detroit Free Press\n\nNevada\n\nGov. Steve Sisolak signed an emergency directive Monday extending phase two of the state’s COVID-19 recovery plan through the end of July. Churches, salons, bars and gyms, all at limited capacity, were part of the state's second phase.\n\nThe move fulfills a promise Sisolak made last week, when he announced a statewide mask-wearing mandate and said “any discussion of entering phase three will be tabled” until further notice.\n\nThe number of Nevadans who have tested positive for COVID-19 reached 24,301 on July 8, with 553 deaths.\n\n– Brett McGinness, Jenny Kane and Marcella Corona, Reno Gazette Journal\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state will pause the next phase in reopening businesses that have been closed or are operating under restrictions. The state would begin to enforce mask-wearing in public. Violators could be fined $100.\n\nThe state recorded 253 new COVID-19 cases on July 6, bringing the state's aggregate total to 13,507 cases. Of those, 5,902 COVID-19 cases — or about 44 percent — are designated as having recovered.\n\n– Algernon D'Ammassa and Lucas Peerman, Las Cruces Sun-News\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFace masks will be required outside under an order expected to be signed July 8 by Gov. Phil Murphy. The announcement of the expected new mandate comes just a couple days after Murphy said there should be a national requirement for facial coverings “certainly when you're going out.\"\n\nThis mandate follows a postponement on reopening indoor dining , a major blow to an industry that has struggled since the coronavirus outbreak began.\n\n\"It brings me no joy to do this, but we have no choice,\" he said.\n\n— Terrence T. McDonald, NorthJersey.com\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGov. Roy Cooper moved to extend the state's current reopening phase for another three weeks, through July 17, rather than reopen further. The state is adding a new requirement that people wear face coverings in most public spaces.\n\nCooper announced he would not address reopening plans for the 2020-21 school year, which had been planned Wednesday.\n\nOn July 8, North Carolina set the sixth straight day of record-high COVID-19 hospitalizations, with 994 patients. The state registered 77,310 cases in total as of July 8.\n\n– Todd Runkle and Mackenzie Wicker, Asheville Citizen Times; Brian Wicker, USA TODAY Network\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGov. Tom Wolf announced July 1 that masks are now mandatory \"whenever anyone leaves home.\"\n\n\"Limited exceptions\" will be permitted, and anyone found violating the order will \"be tasked with education\" by officials or law enforcement.\n\nPennsylvania is grappling with 92,148 cases after 849 cases were tacked on to the statewide total July 8, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The state's death toll stands at 6,812.\n\n– Jasmine Vaughn-Hall, York Daily Record\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nStarting July 11, South Carolina's 8,000 restaurants, bars, breweries and other establishments will be ordered to stop serving alcohol after 11 p.m., Gov. Henry McMaster announced Friday.\n\nHis executive order, which he called \"the last call,\" will not affect the sale of beer, wine and liquor at grocery stores or convenience stores. Bars and restaurants that violate the order can lose their liquor licenses, McMaster said.\n\nThe move is meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the state's under-40 population, which now accounts for more than half of the over 50,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\n\"We hope that this will help all of us, particularly the younger generations, to realize just how serious this virus is and how much is at stake if we don't see these infection rates start dropping,\" McMaster said.\n\n— Nikie Mayo and Kirk Brown, Greenville News\n\nTennessee\n\nGov. Bill Lee granted authority July 3 to mayors in 89 counties in Tennessee to issue their own face mask mandates as COVID-19 cases rise statewide. The move follows a record day-over-day increase after the state health department reported 1,822 new cases.\n\nThat comes days after Lee extended his state of emergency declaration on June 29, along with a host of other provisions that were set to expire this week.\n\nTennessee will remain in a state of emergency until at least Aug. 29, according to Lee's latest order. The order expanded access to telehealth services, allowed restaurants to offer take-out and delivery alcohol, and eased access to unemployment benefits.\n\nTennessee shattered its daily record for both new coronavirus infections and active infections on July 8.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Health announced 2,472 new cases of coronavirus, along with 20 more deaths and 73 more hospitalizations. There are now 22,565 active cases in the state, the most since the pandemic began.\n\nAs of July 7, Tennessee has had at least 55,986 confirmed cases and 685 deaths.\n\n– Joel Ebert and Brett Kelman, Nashville Tennessean\n\nTexas\n\nRolling back an aggressive reopening process, Gov. Greg Abbott closed Texas bars and limited restaurant occupancy, leading to a lawsuit from a state group, and prohibited elective surgeries. He also issued a statewide mask order July 2, requiring Texans in counties with more than 20 positive COVID-19 cases to wear masks in public spaces.\n\nTexas health officials reported 9,979 new COVID-19 cases, 98 additional deaths and 9,610 total hospitalizations July 8 — the latter two single-day records for the state amid a pandemic that is showing no sign of diminishing.\n\n– Nicole Cobler, Austin American-Statesman\n\nUtah\n\nA week after mandating masks at all state facilities, troubling numbers prompted Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to require masks in regions of Utah that are home to several of the state’s famous national parks July 2. He announced a pause in reopening in June.\n\nUtah had counted 26,675 cases total, with 1,678 hospitalizations and 201 deaths.\n\n.\n\n– The Spectrum\n\nVirginia\n\nThough Gov. Ralph Northam announced July 1 the state would begin its third phase of reopening, he has decided to prohibit bar seating as of Wednesday.\n\nRestaurants and bars may still be able to house guests as long as they're eating at tables 6 feet apart, according to a statement from the governor's office. “I am watching what is happening in other states — we are taking a cautious approach as we enter Phase Three and maintaining the current restrictions on bar areas,” Northam said in the release.\n\nPhase three allows businesses to increase capacity to 75% and entertainment businesses to increase to 50%. As of July 8, Virginia has had more than 67,000 cases of COVID-19, with just over 6,600 total hospitalizations and more than 1,900 deaths.\n\nWashington\n\nDays after Gov. Jay Inslee delayed phase four of reopening amid a surge in coronavirus cases, he announced a short-term extension to the state's \"Safe Start\" emergency guidelines through at least July 8.\n\nAccording to the Seattle Times, his announcement came \"in anticipation of additional modifications\" early next week.\n\nAs of July 1, 17 of Washington state’s 39 counties had moved into phase three of Inslee’s four-part coronavirus recovery plan, allowing for gatherings of no more than 50 people, resuming non-essential travel and reopening theaters, libraries and museums, among other businesses.\n\nWashington has had nearly 38,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of July 6, according to a tally by the state's Department of Health.\n\n– Austen Macalus, Kitsap Sun\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

These states have the highest answer", "text": "What states have the best and worst tippers? And what foods were the most popular at quick-service restaurants across the U.S. and which states saw price increases?\n\nToast, a digital platform built for restaurants, provided some insights in its latest Quarter 2 2024 Restaurant Trends Report.\n\nThe report is generated using \"aggregative data analysis\" from a selection of restaurants in various U.S. cities on the Toast platform, which serves approximately 120,000 restaurant locations as of June 30, Toast said. It \"offers a comprehensive view of transactional data and consumer behavior at Toast restaurants,\" Toast Chief Marketing Officer Kelly Esten told USA TODAY.\n\nPrices for food went up across the board. Esten said that \"could be attributed to a combination of inflation and rising business costs. Our data shows a consistent year-over-year price increase for various lunch items at quick-service restaurants (QSRs), with sandwiches, bowls, burgers, and sodas seeing an average price increase of 4.6%, which may be indicative of market trends that inflation could influence.\" A quick-service restaurant is an industry term for a restaurant that is casual and provides food quickly. It also usually has limited or no table service, or servers.\n\nA shift in when people are eating out\n\nEsten said one of the things that surprised her was a shift toward breakfast in many cities.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"We found that consumer spending at quick-service restaurants using Toast saw a noticeable shift toward breakfast and away from dinner and late-night transactions,\" she said. Consumer spending at quick-service restaurants in 20 U.S. cities saw this trend, according to the report.\n\nThe city with the largest increase in breakfast transactions was Richmond, Virginia (up 15%). Oklahoma City (up 11%), Indianapolis (up 8%) and Philadelphia (up 8%) followed.\n\nCities with the largest decreases in dinner transactions were: Columbus, Ohio (down 9%), Minneapolis (down 8%), Austin, Texas (down 4%), Charlotte, North Carolina (down 4%), and Miami (down 4%).\n\nAmong late-night transactions, the cities with the biggest decreases were Oklahoma City (down 15%), Denver (down 9%), Seattle (down 9%) and Columbus (down 8%).\n\nHere are some quick bite results\n\nHere are highlights from the latest report:\n\nGuests at quick-service restaurants paid an average of $11.26 for sandwiches and wraps, $12.98 for bowls and $11.45 for burgers. Guests also paid $11.42 for salads, $10.74 for burritos, $6.04 for an order of fries and $3 for a soda. All the prices represented a 2.7% to 4.6% increase from the same time last year.\n\nSandwiches and wraps were the most popular foods at quick-service restaurants in every state except California, Nevada, Oregon, and Texas, where tacos are the most popular. Bowls were most popular in Hawaii, and salads were the most popular item in Utah.\n\nTipping dropped slightly in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter, dropping a tenth of a percent to 18.8% from 18.9%. Average full-service restaurant tips dipped to 19.3% in the second quarter, compared to 19.4% in the first quarter and average quick-service restaurant tips dropped to 15.9% in the second quarter when compared with 16% in the first quarter. Tips for the report were analyzed for tips added via a card or digital payment. Cash tips and transactions without tips were not included in the analysis.\n\nWhat's the best, worst states for tipping?\n\nThe states with the highest tips are:\n\nDelaware, tipping 21.5% (This is the second quarter in a row Delaware was on the top.) West Virginia, 20.5% Indiana, 20.4% New Hampshire, 20.4% Kentucky, 20.3%\n\nThe states with the lowest tips are:\n\nCalifornia, tipping 17.3% (This is the second quarter in a row California was on the bottom of the list for tipping.) Washington, 17.8% Nevada, 18.1% Florida, 18.2% Louisiana, 18.4%\n\nOur tipping culture: Americans are tipping less often but requests continue to pile up, survey says\n\nWhat states have the most, least expensive sandwiches/wraps?\n\nThe most expensive sandwiches/wraps are in:\n\nHawaii, $13.37 Colorado, $12.72 California, $12.66 Nevada, $12.64 Arizona, $12.20\n\nThe least expensive sandwiches/wraps are in:\n\nIdaho, $8.92 Texas, $9.36 Arkansas, $9.73 Kansas, $9.88 Indiana, $10.09\n\nCalifornia minimum wage increase affects others\n\nToast also looked at how the increase of the California minimum wage for fast-food restaurant employees to $20 per hour on April 1 affected pay for other employees across the state in the food industry. To be covered under the law, employees must work for a fast food restaurant, defined as a restaurant that offers limited or no table service, has 60 or more establishments nationwide and primarily sells food and beverages for immediate consumption.\n\n\"Many quick-service restaurants in the state are exempt from this law (including some that may technically be 'fast food restaurants'), though restaurant operators say they will likely need to offer similar rates to remain competitive,\" Toast reported.\n\nIn June, cashiers at quick-service restaurants in California made a median hourly wage of $16.98, according to the report. Average tips for quick-service restaurant employees dipped in California when the legislation went into effect from $4.98 to $4.77 per hour in April 2024, the report said. \"However, the trend line for tips per hour is similar to that of the national average, so it's unclear from this data if the legislation had any meaningful effect on tips,\" the report said.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

At that point in 2002, the Charlotte, North Carolina, native had been working as a chef in restaurants in New York City and San Francisco for about seven years, and as much as he loved it, he saw more potential on the other side of the kitchen doors.\n\n\"There are two stories I tell people,\" says Bordages, who graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in New York City. \"The real story is you work half the hours, you make double the money. The story I tell people I don't know is because I get to see the guests' interaction and I get to guide their dining experience to the best of what the restaurant can show.\"\n\nFor all the attention chefs get these days, those who bring the food to the table are enjoying an elevated status as well, particularly in finer dining establishments where experience is a premium. Long thought of as a secondary career, or a lesser one, waiting tables is now a professional endeavor, one that provides benefits and a decent wage.\n\nStatistics about server pay are skewed, since the average includes jobs across the spectrum. In South Carolina, the average server salary was $18,460 in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But servers working at local high-end restaurants report salaries closer to $35,000 to $40,000 a year. And in larger cities, professional servers make even more\n\n\"I know some personally who make $100,000 a year,\" says Mike Granta, a chef instructor with the Culinary School of the Carolinas. \"But they run it like a business, like they're leasing five tables a night, and their business is selling and serving.\"\n\nAs Greenville's food scene grows, ushering in more refined restaurant choices and attracting a wider swath of clientele, it's casting a spotlight on the the local service industry and those who work in it.\n\nRestaurant owners and managers are combating turnover through incentives such as health insurance, retirement benefits, paid vacation and, in some cases, a higher hourly wage than the $2.13 standard.\n\nThey are upping the training they provide to waitstaff, adding classes on wine and food pairing or sessions on farm-to-table sourcing.\n\n\"This market is going to continue to grow,\" says Rick Erwin, owner of Rick Erwin Dining Group. \"And with growth is going to come more restaurants, and more restaurants are going to create a need for more great servers.\"\n\nThe growing need for great servers is hitting some smaller, independent restaurants harder.\n\n\"It's tough to compete sometimes,\" says Jason Scholz, owner and executive chef at Stella's Southern Bistro in Simpsonville. \"I'd love it if we could provide benefits for everybody, but for a small operation like us you can't. So you have to find ways to compensate for that.\"\n\nThe need grows\n\nGreenville is not the place it was 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. One look up and down Main Street, or Woodruff Road, confirms it. The city has emerged as a center for international business, has appeared on Top 10 lists from Esquire to AARP Magazine, and had been featured in The New York Times travel section.\n\nThe area's restaurants are a huge economic force, generating $794,930,200 in revenue between July 2013 and June 2014, a 5.9 percent increase over the previous year, according to county economic data from VisitGreenvilleSC.\n\nErwin has watched the changes from his vantage point as owner of now four restaurants (a fifth one is set to open in the spring) for the past 10 years. With each new venture, the need for professional servers has grown, and it's gotten harder to find people who fit the bill.\n\n\"I just think the pool of service professionals is not as big as it needs to be in this market,\" Erwin says. \"But I think that will eventually take care of itself.\"\n\nErwin is doing his part to see that it does. Three years ago, he added new benefits for servers. His dining group offers full health and retirement benefits to full-time workers, as well as raises based on years of service.\n\nTable 301 Restaurant Group has the same policy in place for its service staff of about 120 to 150. Table 301 owner Carl Sobocinski calls it an investment in the business.\n\nTypically, full-time workers get paid vacation, health and retirement benefits and financial support for continuing education. All the policies go toward keeping good people, Sobocinski says.\n\n\"I think we retain people because we care about them,\" he says. \"And we try to be flexible, and we also give them the same opportunities and benefits they would have in corporate America.\"\n\nChet Green, general manager for High Cotton in Greenville and a stalwart of the food industry for many years, says it costs money and time to train people to the level needed in today's restaurants.\n\nTo attract professionals, you have to treat people as professionals, Green says. High Cotton offers benefits, paid vacation and has moved to a regular paycheck system versus the longtime standard of pocketing tips at the end of the night.\n\nInstead, High Cotton servers report tips earned each night into a computer system and receive payout in their paychecks every other week. The system means servers receive paychecks more similar to other industries.\n\n\"It allows servers to have a document for proof when they apply for a house loan or a car loan,\" Green says. \"That systematic approach and regular paycheck almost gives it more a sense of a real job.\"\n\nThe plight of smaller restaurants\n\nWhile larger restaurant groups can afford to pay for benefits packages for employees, smaller ones often cannot. This means restaurant owners must find other ways to keep good staff.\n\n\"It's not easy,\" says Jason Scholz, of Stella's Southern Bistro. The independent restaurant cannot afford to cover benefits for all employees, Scholz says. The issue has made it difficult in some cases to keep good people, particularly those who have families. Though Scholz says he hopes to see some changes thanks to Obamacare.\n\n\"It'll level the playing field out before long,\" Scholz says hopefully.\n\nIn the meantime, what Scholz can't offer in benefits, he tries to offer in other ways.\n\nStaff always get a free meal during the pre-dinner service. But beyond that, Scholz says he tries to set his staff up for success through adequate training and a comprehensive explanation of the menu and specials before every service, from farm of origin to the preparation of the sauce. The more knowledge the staff has, Scholz reasons, the better they'll be able to sell the products.\n\n\"If they don't have the right tools and training, it makes it hard to be a good salesman,\" Scholz says. \"If they're making good money and are in an environment that sets them up for success, those tools level that playing field.\"\n\nMore training\n\nSetting servers up for success increasingly means more professional training.\n\n\"Thanks to the Food Network and the multitude of shows on food and chefs, the consumer is more educated and they expect a much higher level of expertise and care,\" says Sobocinski, whose Table 301 Group includes six restaurants. \"So societal changes and changes to our industry through social media, blogging, through television shows, has led to a more educated and demanding consumer and we need to be as versed as they are, in my opinion.\"\n\nWaitstaff training at Table 301 has gone from one week to two and includes learning how the kitchen works and how ingredients are sourced, for example, as well as how to serve customers.\n\nTable 301 servers must complete a 12-week beverage program that includes everything from how to open a bottle of wine to how to select the best wine for a dish.\n\n\"When the job does require you to be more knowledgeable and when you can talk to (customers) about these wines on our list or where the food comes from and local producers, all of a sudden you feel more engaged,\" Sobocinski says. \"You're sharing information that that person at the table didn't know. So it's a lot more professional and you've got a lot more pride in what's being done.\"\n\nAt High Cotton, servers in training generally shadow seasoned servers for two weeks, Green says. And knowledge of sourcing and ingredients is imperative.\n\n\"People expect not just for someone to bring them more water and food,\" says Russell Bethea, a server at High Cotton. \"It's about having a knowledge of what you're doing. I think the quality of the food and the service is really what makes the biggest difference.\"\n\nThe Culinary Institute at Greenville Tech requires students to take a dining room management class that includes topics like how to set a proper table, the correct technique to use for serving food and the different kinds of service. There are three, Russian, French and American, each with its own rules and requirements.\n\nMore recently, the Institute has added programs on beverage pairing, in which students learn how to find tasting notes in wines, beers and even hot teas. Students also get TIPS-certified (Training for Intervention Procedures), which covers how to safely serve alcohol.\n\nAt Stella's Bistro, new servers get a manual to take home and study, with information about the restaurant and its philosophy and the farms and farmers who provide ingredients.\n\nA cheese plate at Stella's, for instance, is not simply set on the table. Servers are expected to be able to identify each of the five cheeses, along with where each is from, as well as its tasting notes.\n\n\"Your servers are your sales people,\" Scholz says.\n\n\"As the business owner, I can't maximize the profits in the restaurant without a waitstaff that is trying to sell things,\" Scholz says.\n\nA bona fide career\n\nThe changing nature of the service industry is making it a career people are not simply forced into, but are choosing. It takes skill to succeed.\n\n\"It's just as nuanced a career as anything else,\" says Mamie Morgan, who for seven years worked equal hours teaching poetry at the Governor's School for the Arts and Humanities and waiting tables at Lazy Goat.\n\nShe estimates she put in about 35 hours a week at each job and earned about $35,000 from each. But while the teaching job fulfilled Morgan's passion for writing and for inspiring young minds, as a part-time position, it did not pay her benefits. The waitressing job did.\n\n\"That's something to think about,\" Morgan says with a smile. \"It's so funny people use the phrase 'real job,' when for all intents and purposes, my waitressing job was my real job for seven years.\"\n\nToday, at 32, Morgan is working full time as a poetry teacher, but she hasn't completely left the service industry behind. She averages about 20 hours a week as a manager for Table 301.\n\nBut there are others who have chosen waiting tables over another career. Sobocinski saw a deluge of people during the economic downturn who turned to waiting tables after being laid off from corporate jobs.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you had a higher level of education, more family-oriented, less transient person looking for work,\" he says. After a year or two, they often found the pressures were less than that corporate job and they were making close to the same wage, with a better family life.\n\nEdgar Flores chose waiting tables over a career in graphic design. That's one of the biggest misconceptions about the service industry, Flores says, that it's a dead end.\n\n\"In 2009, when I was in school, everybody and their cousin was a graphic designer,\" Flores says of his career path. \"I was working so I wouldn't be in debt with school, but then at the end of the day, you tally up all the money you're spending . ...\" The better financial decision, he says, was to stay in the service industry.\n\nAs a waiter, Flores has flourished. The 25-year-old father has found a passion for serving people. He has taken advantage of some of Table 301's education programs, too. He recently became a certified sommelier.\n\n\"People still ask, When are you gonna get a real job?\" Flores says. \"But I definitely see a future in this. My long-term goal is to be fully immersed, whether to be partnered with someone at a restaurant or to be a beverage director for a restaurant group.\n\n\"You kind of think of it as a stepping stone, but you find a passion for it.\"\n\nTRENDING ON GREENVILLEONLINE:\n\nQ&Amy: New neighborhood, wider street for Roper Mountain Road\n\nSimpsonville police: Armed man robbed CVS", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2024/04/26/2024-nfl-draft-experience-downtown-detroit-restaurant-food/73466156007/", "title": "In downtown Detroit at the 2024 NFL draft experience: What I learned", "text": "Hi, my name is Amy and I am a secret Detroit Lions fan. Until now, that is.\n\nSure feels good to say that. And Thursday, it sure felt good to be surrounded by 275,000 of my new friends at the 2024 NFL draft in downtown Detroit.\n\nI am a web editor at the Free Press. The job title doesn't really sum up everything I do, but typically I'm the one you'll normally find sharing stories, photos and videos on Instagram, including making cards of our cool content. I spent the day at the draft after work with one of very closest friends, Donald Wine II, but ending up shooting some video of the amazing outfits I saw worn by football fans. And there were a ton.\n\nDonald, who was born in Michigan, graduated from Detroit Country Day School in 2000 and is one of the most loyal Detroit sports fans I know. A graduate of Duke University, he's now a lawyer in Washington D.C., but he comes back to Detroit for games any chance he gets.\n\nHaving spent the day at the draft, I have some tips/suggestions for anyone visiting today.\n\nGetting through security\n\nWhen we first headed to the NFL Draft Experience Entry 2 at Griswold and Jefferson, a huge crush of people was entering at the same time. There wasn't really a line, just a mass of people moving, and security was choosing who to pass through the metal detectors seemingly arbitrarily, but the pace was nice and steady.\n\nBy the time we reached the front, we were ushered into separate lines divided by metal barriers to go through another round of metal detectors. We had our phones out, with our NFL One Pass apps open (the only way to get into the cordoned-off draft area) open and QR code entry code on screen, but no one asked to see or scan our apps.\n\nI wore a clear bag, one that I carry to soccer matches, but no one went through it or asked me to open it.\n\nThe fan experience\n\nThe NFL Draft Experience is no joke. So much to see and do. From the oversized helmets to the uniforms, there are many photo opportunities to be had. Some of the cooler things to see — Super Bowl rings and the Vince Lombardi trophy — have long lines to see so pack your patience.\n\nEveryone seemed excited to be there. Fans from opposing teams were commenting on each other's cool outfits. We saw lots of regional teams represented — Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Cincinnati — and divisional rivals — Green Bay, Minnesota and Chicago.\n\nBathrooms, or lack thereof\n\nThere aren't enough bathrooms. Simple as that. I found it ironic that there were a long row of portable toilets outside the zone along Griswold on the way to enter the fan experience, inaccessible once you're inside the main draft area. A lot of good that will do.\n\nAnd if you leave the draft area to use the restroom, you may risk not getting back in. The NFL had pushed a notice through OnePass that the draft was at maximum capacity around 6:30 p.m. — and there's no exception for folks who just stepped out for a call of nature or food.\n\nBeverages abound, especially adult beverages\n\nWithin, however, drinks are free flowing. Everywhere you turn, there are so many options to purchase drinks, especially adult beverages. But drinks will cost you. Two peach Vodka seltzers (no jokes, please) cost me $40.70 with tip. And you can't bring in outside beverages, so don't try — staff will make you toss them out.\n\nThis way to the merch stand, please\n\nBuying merchandise is not a problem. There are a ton of trucks around to sell you some pretty cool Detroit 2024 NFL draft gear or team merchandise.\n\nThe official NFL shop is inside the building at Woodward and Michigan. If you see the line for Eminem's Mom's Spaghetti, you are close. Look for signs for the store entrance on Michigan. The exit is on Woodward. And if you buy a baseball hat (they have all NFL teams available in several options), you can get one of four cool patches added. I am fond of the Detroit record one, FWIW. Very cool nod to Motown.\n\nHow do I get out of here?\n\nWhen we were standing near the exit of the NFL store on Woodward, out-of-town folks kept asking me how to exit the zone. With my Lions gear on, they assumed I knew. Nope.\n\nEven Lions fans kept wandering by, looking for a way out. Mystified, because if you parked north of Campus Martius, if would seem natural that if you needed to exit, this would be the place. But no, fans looking to leave were met with a barrier.\n\nSomeone told me they'd entered at that spot earlier, but I couldn’t confirm that.\n\nLarger signs for the exits would have been extremely helpful. Even those with maps seemed extremely confused.\n\nFood options do not abound\n\nThere are not enough food options within the zone. Sure, there's Mom's Spaghetti (still need to get there) and Little Caesars Pizza food trucks, but not nearly enough for the amount of people.\n\nWe got hungry around 5 p.m. Thursday and stepped out of the zone to get some food. Big mistake.\n\nWe went to Athens Souvlaki in the Penobscot Building at 645 Griswold St. Their normally extensive menu was limited to a few options, but we still had amazing Greek salads and gyros (big portions).\n\nBut as we sat to eat, the One Pass notifications told us there were delays at the entrance to the NFL experience. So we started thinking of a Plan B, but closed our tab and headed back to get in line.\n\nBut back in line at Entry 2, we got another notification that the NFL experience was closed and wouldn't reopen that night. We were skeptical, because we'd heard that before, so we stood in line for another 30 to 40 minutes with other fans — hundreds at this entry kept chanting \"Let us in\" — who also seemed confused over the process before abandoning the line. It wasn't until we headed away from the line that we heard in a public address overhead that the entries were, in fact, closed and wouldn't reopen until Friday. Poor communication, I say.\n\nI witnessed folks sneaking into exits to get back in. We heard reports another entry was breached, but I am trying to confirm that rumor.\n\nOther options to watch\n\nSince we couldn't get back into the NFL draft experience, we walked up to Capitol Park, where there were huge TV screens and a DJ, and watched from that fan zone.\n\nThere were tons of seating options, but by the time we arrived, it was standing room only.\n\nIt was crowded, but turned out to be a lot of fun. The energy was just as incredible as the NFL Draft Experience.\n\nPlus, lots of food and drink options, cool pop-up shops and an adequate number of bathrooms.\n\nA good Plan B if our original plans fall through again, as Donald and I head downtown for Day 2.\n\nBut I will probably be wearing Minnesota Vikings gear for my husband, former Free Press Executive Editor Robert Huschka, since he'll hopefully be joining us this time. And wearing it for J.J.

The cities of Birmingham and Anniston called off their parades in recent days as caseloads and hospitalizations increase across the state. The cities of Bessemer, Gadsden and Madison were among those that previously called off their Christmas parades, citing safety concerns related to the virus. Some places are still planning events like tree lightings that residents can watch online, and other places are creating alternative events. Hartselle plans a contest in which residents can compete for prizes by decorating their homes. Tuscaloosa announced a “reverse” parade in which people can stay in their cars and drive past decorated floats in a park, but organizers canceled it, citing low participation.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Bars and restaurants in the city will be closed for indoor service, employers must allow people to work from home if possible, and many businesses will be limited to 25% capacity for the month of December as the state’s largest city tries to stem the increase in coronavirus cases, Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson said Wednesday. The new rules go into effect Tuesday and don’t end until Jan. 1, she said during a teleconference. “Today, we find ourselves in a situation that nobody wants to be in. There are no easy answers, but we must act because continuing on this path is the worst of all bad options,” she said. The director of the Anchorage Health Department, Heather Harris, said the agency “has been waving red flags for weeks as we have experienced record-breaking case counts.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With their annual Thanksgiving meal for disadvantaged students canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak, alumni from one local community college held a drive-thru food distribution Tuesday so people could cook their own holiday dinner. The vehicles of 100 students who signed up beforehand lined up in the Phoenix College parking lot. Masked staff and volunteers placed a bag with turkey, mashed potatoes, pie and other fixings in the back of each vehicle. It’s an example of how traditional meals for the disadvantaged have had to be reimagined this year to prevent spread of the virus even as the ranks of the needy have grown. “A lot of the students are focused on trying to figure out what they are going to eat” for Thanksgiving, said Monique Briones, a nursing student helping distribute food. She also signed up for her own family to receive food for a holiday meal donated by the Phoenix College Alumni Association. Briones is living with her boyfriend, their five children and his parents during the pandemic.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state hit another record high Wednesday, crossing the 1,000 mark for the first time since the pandemic began. The state saw an increase of 40 virus hospitalizations to bring the current number to 1,028, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. That tops Tuesday’s record high of 988 hospitalizations. Arkansas reported 1,965 new cases and 20 more deaths. One in every 243 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. “While we express our thanks across the state in smaller groups than normal years, I am more grateful than ever for the dedication of our health care workers,” Hutchinson said in a statement. “The new hospitalizations today adds to the burden, and let’s all go the extra mile to protect each other.” On Tuesday, the state’s largest school district said it would temporarily switch to virtual learning after the Thanksgiving break because so many teachers were quarantined because of the virus. The 22,000-student Springdale School District said classes will be remote until Dec. 7 because of a shortage of available substitute teachers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state reported a record number of coronavirus cases Wednesday as Los Angeles restaurants prepared to close for three weeks and as firefighters in Silicon Valley were being enlisted to enforce public health rules to try to halt the spread of infections. Cases of COVID-19 have been climbing at an alarming rate for weeks and hit a new high of 18,350 recorded Tuesday, surpassing a previous record of more than 15,000 cases announced Saturday, state officials said. The seven-day average of positive tests has gone from 5.3% to 6.5% in the past week. “We are really, really concerned,” said Dr. Marty Fenstersheib, COVID-19 testing officer for Santa Clara County. “All of the metrics that we have been following, that have done well in previous months, are now going up very steeply. Our positivity rate in our county is rising and especially in our most affected communities.” Nearly all of the state is now under a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew and subject to the strictest regulations for businesses to operate, including a ban on indoor dining and limited capacity in stores. But Los Angeles has gone even further. As cases spiked in the past week, it ordered restaurants to stop serving meals after Wednesday night and has been mulling another stay-home order.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis warned Tuesday that some restaurant owners who defy or ignore strict state health orders to stem spread of the coronavirus could lose their licenses to operate. Colorado’s restaurant sector has been hit hard during the pandemic, with many forced to close and thousands of workers laid off. In recent days, restaurants in counties designated “red” by the state in a color-coded scheme that gauges increasing COVID-19 infection cases have been forced to halt indoor dining. “Every business in the state of Colorado needs to follow our laws and, whether you agree with it or not, in red counties, not having indoor dining is the law of Colorado,” Polis said. “Any type of business that violates a health order, whether it’s hepatitis, salmonella or COVID … could lose their license to operate.” The Democratic governor’s comments came after several Loveland businesses in Larimer County signed a letter stating that they will continue operating at full indoor capacity even though the county was placed in the “red” restriction category Tuesday. Polis said government financial aid for the restaurant sector is coming – possibly in the form of sales tax breaks – when the Legislature convenes in a special session next week.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A small number of flagrant violations and concerns about the holiday shopping season prompted Gov. Ned Lamont to impose a steep, new $10,000 fine on businesses that break the state’s coronavirus rules. The new fine was to replace the current $500 maximum penalty beginning at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, the Democratic governor announced Tuesday evening. A small number of restaurants have been cited for essentially operating as bars, which have been ordered closed during the pandemic. The governor said the harsher fine was the result of concerns by municipal leaders, public health officials and people in the business community. He also cited concerns about keeping workers and customers safe during Black Friday and the rest of the holiday shopping season. The state has an array of rules on businesses during the pandemic. Restaurants, for example, are limited to 50% capacity, with a maximum of eight people per table, and must stop inside dining service at 9:30 p.m. Local health directors or other municipal officials can issue the fines with the support of police.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State officials are inviting residents to get outside Friday as an alternative to going shopping, especially amid rising coronavirus case numbers. Officials are waiving state park and Brandywine Zoo entry fees on Black Friday as part of the nationwide #OptOutside movement. State parks will open at 8 a.m., with the exception of Fort Delaware State Park, which is closed for the season. The Brandywine Zoo and its new Madagascar Exhibit featuring rare lemurs and radiated tortoises will be open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Reservations are required by calling, and members can reserve time at the zoo online. Visitors who are kindergarten age or older must bring face coverings with them to enter a park and wear them when they cannot maintain social distancing from other visitors.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As a second wave of the pandemic meets a second blood shortage nationwide, the Red Cross in the D.C. region reported a “grave” scarcity of convalescent plasma, WUSA-TV reports. The critical liquid part of the blood in COVID-19 survivors can be harnessed and used to treat coronavirus patients in intensive care. Blood plasma from coronavirus survivors contains antibodies, which may help trigger immune responses in people severely stricken by the virus. The Red Cross is now testing all blood, platelet and plasma donations for coronavirus antibodies, so if donors didn’t know they once had the virus, their plasma can help patients in dire need of treatment. “The need for convalescent plasma supersedes all the needs that we have right now,” Red Cross spokesperson Regina Boothe Bratton said. The Red Cross is imploring people looking for ways to help over the holidays to visit the organization's blood donation website and schedule an appointment. The organization said it generally experiences a blood shortage between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, but COVID-19 has compounded the problem.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A popular waterfront festival has been postponed amid a surge in confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The annual parade Gasparilla Pirate Fest that attracts about 200,000 people to Tampa’s downtown waterfront is typically held every January but is now planned for mid-April amid continuing health care concerns. Organizers said they consulted with city leaders and health care providers and decided to postpone the festival until next spring to restrict events that attract large crowds. Meanwhile, the Miami Herald said Miami Beach hotels were experiencing last-minute bookings for the Thanksgiving holiday week that may get them near full occupancy for the first time since they were forced to shut down to curb the spread of coronavirus in March. Other events in the state that attract large crowds in the winter such as Art Basel have already been scrapped. The prestigious December art fair draws collectors, socialites and celebrities from around the world.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: As the ravages of the coronavirus forced millions of people out of work, shuttered businesses and shrank the value of retirement accounts, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged to a three-year low. But for Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., the crisis last March signaled something else: a stock buying opportunity. And for the second time in less than two months, Perdue’s timing was impeccable. He avoided a sharp loss and reaped a stunning gain by selling and then buying the same stock: Cardlytics, an Atlanta-based financial technology company on whose board of directors he once served. On Jan. 23, as word spread through Congress that the coronavirus posed a major economic and public health threat, Perdue sold off $1 million to $5 million in Cardlytics stock at $86 a share before it plunged, according to congressional disclosures. Weeks later, in March, after the company’s stock plunged further following an unexpected leadership shake-up and lower-than-forecast earnings, Perdue bought the stock back for $30 a share, investing between $200,000 and $500,000. Those shares have now quadrupled in value, closing at $121 a share Tuesday.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The first coronavirus death on the island of Kauai has been reported. Mayor Derek Kawakami announced in a statement Monday that an elderly resident with no travel history died. COVID-19 has killed 232 others in Hawaii. “It is heartbreaking to report this news especially as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches this week,” Kawakami said. “As a community, we share in this painful loss together and we extend our sincere prayers, love and aloha to the family and loved ones of this individual.” Another Kauai resident died in Arizona earlier this year, The Garden Island reports. Kawakami said Tuesday that he wants to reinstate a requirement that all travelers arriving in his jurisdiction quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether they have obtained a negative coronavirus test. Kauai had no cases of community spread of the coronavirus for several months starting in July. But it’s had six cases of community spread since Oct. 15, when the state began allowing travelers to bypass the two-week quarantine if they tested negative for the disease 72 hours before arriving. Kawakami asked Gov. David Ige for permission to temporarily opt out of the pre-travel testing program.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has proposed using millions of dollars in coronavirus relief aid to have additional safety technology including “walk-through disinfectant cubes” installed at the state Capitol in Boise. McGeachin, a Republican, promoted the “very high-tech equipment” manufactured by Xtreme Manufacturing in Las Vegas to reporters Tuesday while criticizing Republican Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus response, the Idaho Press reports. “A person can walk through a cube and be disinfected from head to toe, including on the bottom of their feet,” she said. But the technology has been widely disputed. The National Institutes of Health published a study in June that found “walk-through sanitation gates” were ineffective and potentially dangerous, noting that the practice violates World Health Organization standards. “Fumigation is meant for inanimate objects and surfaces, and it should never be used on people,” the study said. The proposal calls for spending about $17 million, including $80,000 for two walk-through disinfectant cubes, three mobile units for emergency overflow and staffing for the units.\n\nIllinois\n\nLaSalle: State officials are investigating a coronavirus outbreak at a veterans nursing home in rural Illinois that has infected nearly 200 residents and staff and killed 27 veterans. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office and the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs are attempting to determine what caused the outbreak at the state-run LaSalle Veterans Home in LaSalle, about 90 miles southwest of Chicago. The department on Tuesday requested an independent probe into the facility, which was the focus of a state Senate committee virtual hearing on the outbreak. “The tragedy of what has unfolded at the veterans’ home cannot be understated,” said state Sen. Sue Rezin, who represents the district where the home is located. The current outbreak was identified in late October when a staff member and a resident tested positive for the virus. Since the beginning of November, two-thirds of residents and employees have tested positive, according to the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. State officials have increased staff testing at the facility, and the governor said an infection control team was sent to the home.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University plans to reward its faculty and staff with a $750 bonus for their “heroic work” keeping the West Lafayette campus open amid the coronavirus pandemic, school officials announced Wednesday. The university said more than 15,000 faculty, staff and graduate student staff hired before Sept. 1 will get the money in their checks in December. Part-time staff will get a prorated amount. Purdue President Mitch Daniels said staff in executive-level positions will not get the $750 bonus. Daniels congratulated faculty and staff in a campuswide letter sent Wednesday morning for getting through the in-person portion of the fall semester. He called the bonus an “appreciation award” for their work that kept the campus open during the pandemic. “I admit I was far from certain that even a collection of can-do problem-solvers like ours could pull off that achievement,” Daniels wrote in the letter. “Well, we’re here, and only because of the collective effort we could only imagine in August.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state reported its highest single-day increase in COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, topping the mark set one week prior. The Iowa of Department of Public Health reported another 47 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. In total, 2,271 people with COVID-19 have died in Iowa, according to the state’s Coronavirus.Iowa.gov website. Another 3,365 coronavirus cases were added to the state’s tally Wednesday. The increases come as Iowa hospitals struggle with the coronavirus surge. On Tuesday, Dr. Tammy Chance, the chairperson of the Iowa Hospital Association, warned that the Iowa hospital region that includes the state’s most populous area has at times in the last week been down to two or three intensive care unit beds as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of beds and staffing shortages have forced some Iowa hospitals to transfer patients to other facilities, said Kirk Morris, the president of the association. Other doctors said their regions were experiencing similar shortages.\n\nKansas\n\nGreat Bend: Resistance to masks appears to be weakening as the coronavirus surges, straining the capacity of the state’s hospitals. Gov. Laura Kelly’s latest effort to require face coverings took effect Wednesday, although Kansas law still allows the state’s 105 counties to opt out. Most counties did so the first time Kelly tried to require masks in July. But with the average new case numbers more than nine times higher now than then, there appears to be less pushback. The governor told reporters Tuesday that adoption of mask orders by counties had so far been “pretty good,” The Wichita Eagle reports. “I think it’s because people are so much more aware of how serious this is, how widespread it is,” Kelly said. “And it is no longer an urban issue. I mean, it’s clearly from border to border.” In Barton County, commissioners voted Tuesday to unanimously adopt a countywide mask mandate that went into effect immediately. The commission had rejected mandates twice before, instead appealing to the public to do the right thing. Enforcement is an oft-cited concern. “I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history when it goes down and says we did nothing,” Barton County Commissioner Jennifer Schartz said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Payments that are part of a federal program to aid those unemployed because of the ongoing pandemic will end this weekend under federal rules, affecting roughly 4,700 Kentuckians, the Kentucky Labor Cabinet said Tuesday. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Labor notified the state agency that the number of people receiving extended benefit unemployment insurance as a percentage of the labor force had fallen below the qualifying threshold for the state to continue dispersing funds under the program. As a result, the state will be barred from such payments for a minimum of 13 weeks. Kentucky’s seasonally adjusted preliminary October unemployment rate was 7.4%, the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development Cabinet announced last week. The preliminary October jobless rate was up nearly 2 percentage points from September. Gov. Andy Beshear said there was no recourse to reverse the federal agency’s decision and acknowledged that Kentucky families are hurting financially because of the pandemic. After Saturday, no new applications will be accepted, and claimants who have yet to exhaust all benefits will not receive the balance of their funds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Caddo Parish is weighing whether to pay $500 to families who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Legislation was introduced Nov. 19 by Caddo Parish Commissioner Stormy Gage-Watts at a parish council meeting that would pay $500 to 500 eligible families. Families would have to apply and meet income requirements, give proof of income, and provide a statement of how the pandemic has affected their family’s finances. The money, which would be available on a first-come basis, would come from money already set aside for emergency disaster assistance. “Just a couple of years ago, we were able to be able to provide allocations for tornado victims, so we did that through a special fund, which is an emergency ordinance, and this is the same thing. It’s no different,” Gage-Watts told KTBS. The station said there will be a public hearing on the issue Dec. 3.\n\nMaine\n\nGuilford: A local medical supplies manufacturer has been awarded more than $11 million from the federal government to produce millions of additional testing swabs. Puritan Medical Products of Guilford received the money through the federal Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Monday. The company will increase its production of swabs by 3 million per month, Collins said. Puritan has played a major role in the nation’s efforts to conduct enough testing to help corral the coronavirus pandemic. The White House announced in June that the federal government was providing more than $75 million for Puritan to double its production to 40 million swabs per month. The company’s total production of flock tip swabs and foam swabs is at least 90 million per month now, Collins said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: “Answer the call” and “download the COVID Alert app” have joined the growing list of pandemic precautions as the Maryland Health Department battles a pandemic surge this holiday season. Dr. Katherine Feldman, director of the Maryland Department of Health’s contact tracing unit, told Capital News Service it was important for Marylanders to enable the MD COVID Alert exposure notification app, answer calls from contact tracers, wear a mask, socially distance and continue to take other protective measures to “reduce transmission and have all of us stay safe and healthy.” MD COVID Alert is a passive system that users enable on their iPhone or download to their Android phone in order to receive notifications when they have come in close proximity to another user who may have tested positive for the coronavirus. The state Department of Health launched the system Nov. 10 and reported over 1 million Marylanders, about 17% of the state’s population, downloaded the app within the first week. Gov. Larry Hogan said at a press conference last week that while the number of state contact tracers has been “ramped up,” there are other challenges to address. “Our problem is that so many people refuse to give the information,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is doing its part to control the spread of COVID-19 by handing out free face coverings at several subway stations and trolley stops. The service that launched Monday is backed by athletic footwear company New Balance, which donated 100,000 masks to the MBTA. MBTA commuters have been required to wear face coverings since early May. Transit police can fine people not wearing a mask up to $300. “Wearing a face covering is one of the most effective ways to combat the virus,” MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said in a statement. “We ask that riders do their part by wearing face coverings while within the MBTA system and distancing while on public transit.” The masks will be offered during peak morning and evening commute times at the Charles/MGH, Downtown Crossing, Forest Hills, Hynes Convention Center, Maverick, Orient Heights, Park Street and Quincy Center stations.\n\nMichigan\n\nTrenton: Restaurant owner Jeremy Syrocki hit frustration overload with the latest restaurant restrictions shutting down indoor dining for the second time this year, and he’s using an inflatable Grinch to show how he feels. New rules from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services came in an announcement Nov. 15 by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and took effect last Wednesday. Syrocki decided to take a stand and do something about it. While shopping for portable patio heaters, he spotted an inflatable of the main character in the Dr. Seuss classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” The Grinch reminded Syrocki of Whitmer, he said. The 10-foot-high creature now stands on Truago’s patio in downtown Trenton – one of Syrocki’s three downriver restaurants. The inflatable has a sign hanging from its neck that reads “Gretch the Grinch.” Syrocki also added red lipstick to the Grinch. In a Facebook post the morning after the Grinch went up, Syrocki wrote that the stunt is about getting the attention of the governor. He said he voted for Whitmer but now believes he shouldn’t have.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A surge in COVID-19 cases has led to critical staffing shortages at some nursing homes and assisted living facilities, forcing the state to send the National Guard to help out and ask all state employees to consider volunteering in facilities. New data from the Minnesota Department of Health shows 90% of the state’s nursing homes and 58% of assisted living facilities have active virus outbreaks. The data includes more than 70 senior care homes that didn’t have any coronavirus-infected residents one month ago, the Star Tribune reports. Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday that 47 long-term care facilities are in “a crisis staffing situation” and are receiving active support from the state, including help from federal health nurses. Gov. Tim Walz’s administration has taken the unusual step of emailing all state employees and asking them to consider volunteering for two-week stints in long-term care facilities, particularly in greater Minnesota. The email, which was sent to the heads of all state agencies, says no prior experience is required, and the state would cover travel and temporary housing costs.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves announced Tuesday that he is expanding his mask mandate to cover half of the state’s 82 counties. Reeves had previously placed under the mandate 22 counties with the highest number of new cases of coronavirus. “It’s clear we are in the middle of our second surge,” Reeves said during a briefing at which he announced he was adding 19 counties to that list. Dr. LouAnn Woodward, vice chancellor and dean of the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s School of Medicine, had called on the governor Monday to reinstitute a statewide mask mandate. She said last week that no intensive care unit beds were available at the hospital, Mississippi’s only level-one trauma center. “I think we have reasonable evidence to believe that the county-by-county approach is not working,” she said Monday. Meanwhile, Mississippi’s top health official said this week that he is exhausted trying to convince people in the state to take the coronavirus seriously and follow public health guidelines. “It’s just going nowhere,” Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer, said Monday during a meeting with members of the state Senate. “We have chosen, very clearly, to prioritize social events over disease transmission.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state’s two largest metropolitan areas are cracking down on restaurants that violate rules designed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City’s liquor control authorities found two dozen bars and restaurants in violation of the city’s new COVID-19 restrictions after a weekend sweep of 185 establishments. The city’s Department of Regulated Industries, which governs liquor licenses, used to rely primarily on complaints to enforce restrictions. But as the latest set of rules issued by Mayor Quinton Lucas took effect Friday – limiting bars and restaurants to 50% capacity and a closing time of 10 p.m. – the city became more proactive. Meanwhile, the St. Louis County Department of Public Health sent certified letters to three dozen bars and businesses ordering them to cease indoor service or face lawsuits or criminal charges. Eleven of those establishments had already received a second notice from the county, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Many of the restaurants were among the same establishments that are suing the county seeking to block its suspension of indoor dining.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Schools will receive nearly $13 million in additional coronavirus relief funds before Dec. 30, Gov. Steve Bullock announced Wednesday. Public and private schools were allowed to request additional funding in October after Bullock directed $75 million in July from the state’s coronavirus relief funds to K-12 schools. More than 180 schools were approved for additional funding. The new funding includes about $5.7 million in unspent funding from the original $75 million allocated to schools and about $7.2 million in newly allocated funds. Federal coronavirus relief funds must be spent by the end of December, and Bullock called on Congress to pass additional school financing relief for 2021. “While this additional funding will serve our schools with continued needs through the end of this year, our schools head into the new year empty handed,” Bullock, a Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A meatpacking plant has been accused in a lawsuit of failing to take adequate precautions to protect workers from the coronavirus. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the federal lawsuit Monday against Noah’s Ark Processors in Hastings, Nebraska. The suit said the plant has made no effort to spread workers out to limit the spread of the virus, and it fails to promptly replace workers’ masks when they become soiled with blood and sweat. The plaintiffs include several former workers at the plant. “Noah’s Ark has shown a shocking indifference to its employees and the community by failing to take common-sense steps to protect them from the spread of COVID-19,” ACLU attorney Spencer Amdur said. Company officials declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday. The meatpacking industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic because workers stand shoulder-to-shoulder as they toil inside the plants and often crowd together in locker rooms and on breaks. The ACLU lawsuit said managers at Noah’s ark pressured people to continue working even when they were sick and showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The coronavirus is spreading so fast in the state that one person is diagnosed with it every minute, and someone is dying from it every two hours, state health officials said Wednesday. Nearly half of the state’s 142,239 total cases since the start of the pandemic in March have occurred since September – fully one-fourth of those in the month of November and 10% in just the past seven days, according to the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services. “We have COVID-19 exploding in our community. It is spreading rapidly,” Washoe County Health District Officer Kevin Dick told reporters in Reno. “We have exponential growth going on.” While the majority of the state’s cases and 2,071 total deaths have been reported in Clark County – the most populous county that includes Las Vegas – the Reno-Sparks area in Washoe County has been hit the hardest in recent weeks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State legislators are working on a bill to offer price protections for adult vaccines, such as those pending for COVID-19. Rep. Jerry Knirk, a Democrat from Freedom, told WMUR-TV that by expanding a New Hampshire nonprofit association that pools insurance company money to buy vaccine doses in bulk, the savings to the state and patients could be immense. The process is already done in New Hampshire for pediatric vaccines, he said. The bill would expand the New Hampshire Vaccine Association, which purchases vaccines for children under 19, to all adults. “In the pediatric program, we purchase about $38 million worth of vaccines for about $28 million,” Knirk said. “The savings is roughly about 26%. For the adults, it is estimated it should be very similar in terms of the degree of savings.” The federal government is expected to pay for a COVID-19 vaccination, but the bill could come in handy if gaps in funding arise next year or if suddenly states find themselves in the position of trying to obtain more vaccine.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: With COVID-19 cases rising at an “alarming rate,” Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday abandoned the formula to determine which out-of-state travelers should quarantine once they reach New Jersey. Instead, Murphy said anyone coming into the Garden State from beyond the four-state region of Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania should isolate for 14 days. “Given the increased risk of spreading COVID-19 for both residents who travel outside the state and for visitors into the state, New Jersey continues to strongly discourage all non-essential interstate travel at this time,” Murphy said in a statement. His announcement came on one of the busiest traveling days of the year. About 50 million people were expected to travel in the United States for Thanksgiving, according to AAA. That would be a decline from past years, but federal and state officials, including Murphy, have urged people to stay home this year and keep their celebrations to immediate family members and fewer than 10 people to avoid spreading the virus.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bipartisan coronavirus relief bill that will deliver a one-time $1,200 check to all types of unemployed workers and up to $50,000 for certain businesses. The bill also provides smaller stimulus checks to immigrants without legal status in the country and dependents, as well as additional funds for food banks, virus testing and contact tracing efforts. Republican lawmakers were unsuccessful in their efforts to provide aid for low-income essential workers. Democrats said federal guidelines would prevent such spending, and they promised to find ways during the regular session in January to address the issue. Most of the proposed spending will be made possible by federal relief funding previously assigned to New Mexico, including about $319 million in unspent funds that were expected to expire soon. An additional $10 million in state general funds was allocated for the testing and tracing efforts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City Winery, an upscale chain, is trying a novel approach to indoor dining during a pandemic: Two nights a week, all patrons and staffers at its Manhattan location have to take a rapid virus test on-site and get an all-clear before coming in. Other nights unfold without testing but with precautions including temperature checks and spaced-out tables. Costing diners $50 per person on top of their tabs, it’s an elite experiment – complete with a free glass of sparkling wine – and health experts caution that a test isn’t a failsafe. So does City Winery CEO Michael Dorf, but he thinks the idea is worth trying as restaurants try to get through a year of shutdowns and social distancing. With winter looming over New York eateries’ outdoor-dining lifeline, “how do we get people to dine inside, feel comfortable, feel as safe as possible so that they can spend money in our restaurant, and our staff can feel comfortable?” asked Dorf, who said City Winery’s business is down 85% compared to 2019. A hotel with a rooftop lounge and restaurant in Queens’ hip Long Island City neighborhood briefly tried a similar testing program this summer. But it’s not clear how many other restaurants might follow suit.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some of the state’s colleges plan to require students to show a negative coronavirus test in order to return to campus after their winter break. At the University of North Carolina System Board of Governors meeting last week, President Peter Hans said schools will do reentry testing or require students to show a negative test before they can return for the spring semester. None of the universities in the UNC System required students or employees to be tested for the virus before coming to campus in the fall. While many offered ongoing surveillance testing throughout the semester, it was mostly voluntary. UNC-Chapel Hill, N.C. State University and East Carolina University each had to send students home, close dorms and move classes online because of spikes in coronavirus cases in August. Now, each is requiring students to get tested for the coronavirus at the start of the spring semester.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The head of the largest hospital in the city is pleading for people to wear masks, warning that not following COVID-19 safety measures could have other consequences aside from spreading the coronavirus during the holiday season. Sanford Fargo President and CEO Bryan Nermoe said the failure of people to follow COVID-19 protocols could force some patients who need treatment for ailments other than the virus to be put on waiting lists or sent to facilities hundreds of miles away. In Fargo alone, the city’s three hospitals were down to four staffed intensive care unit beds and 19 staffed inpatient beds, according to state data compiled Tuesday. That included no ICU beds and 17 regular beds at Sanford, which recently opened 14 new patient rooms at its main facility in southwest Fargo. Nermoe is asking people to keep front-line caregivers in mind when deciding whether to wear masks, wash hands, maintain social distancing and avoid large gatherings. “On behalf of them, mask up,” Nermoe said. “Do it for them because they are really going above and beyond, 24/7, 365, of really trying to meet the needs of people in our region.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Seven of the state’s biggest counties on Wednesday urged residents to stay home and follow guidelines on social gatherings and wearing masks. The counties said in a joint statement that they want people only to leave home for work, school, medical appointments or buying essential items such as groceries. “Cases and hospital admissions are at the highest levels we have seen during this pandemic, by far. These county health advisories reflect the urgent need for all of us to protect ourselves and our families to stop the spread of this virus,” said Denise Driehaus, president of the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners. The counties are Franklin, Cuyahoga, Hamilton, Summit, Montgomery, Lucas and Mahoning. Cases in Ohio continue to spike. The state’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 5,049 new cases per day Nov. 10 to 8,495 new cases per day Tuesday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data provided by the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Wednesday that public schools will be allowed to offer in-school quarantines for students exposed to the coronavirus. Schools in Mustang became the first in the state to adopt the policy, the department said. “In the past, if a student had tested positive for COVID-19, any students who interacted with the case – up to the entire class – would have been required to move to distance learning for 14 days,” said Dr. Jared Taylor, Interim State Epidemiologist. “An in-school quarantine option is the best way to keep our kids in school and prevent them from falling behind.” Mustang Superintendent Charles Bradley said in a statement that the policy allows the suburban Oklahoma City district to avoid moving entirely to online teaching. Students who are quarantined will be allowed to go to school to take part in virtual classes but kept out of individual classrooms in buildings such as gyms or an auditorium, where they would be socially distanced and must wear masks. The policy will be in effect from Nov. 30 through Dec. 23.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Bars and restaurants can reopen for limited outdoor service next week, but many restrictions will remain in place until a vaccine against the coronavirus is widely available, Gov. Kate Brown said on Wednesday. She pleaded with Oregonians to stay safe during the holidays and protect others by not ignoring safety protocols, like wearing masks and limiting personal contacts. Meanwhile, the rate of infections continue to skyrocket. A total of 8,687 new daily cases occurred last week, a 34% increase over the previous record-high week. Weekly hospitalizations rose to a record 366, a 26% increase. The revamped restrictions take effect when the current two-week “freeze” expires Dec. 3. Currently, only takeout restaurant service is allowed. The restaurant industry pushed hard against the restrictions, as several eateries closed for good, and others were at risk of doing so. Asked if at a virtual news conference if she was bending to industry pressure, Brown said: “I’m in the business, frankly, of saving lives and also preserving livelihoods.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Cellphones across the state received an alert Wednesday afternoon notifying them of a growing COVID-19 emergency. The alert was shared on the day Pennsylvania surpassed 10,000 coronavirus deaths. More than 6,700 new cases were announced Wednesday, and 3,897 hospitalizations were reported. Of those people hospitalized, 895 were in intensive care units. “In PA, COVID-19 rates are rising & hospitals could soon be at capacity. Stay home if possible,” the phone alert said. “If you must go out, maintain social distance, wear a mask, wash your hands for 20 seconds. Stay up to date on the spread of COVID in your community so you can protect your loved ones with the COVID Alert PA app.” The alert was sent by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency through the national Wireless Emergency Alert system. Wednesday was the first time Pennsylvania used that system to share a message about COVID-19, and it reached phones about a half-hour before bars and restaurants were required to stop serving alcohol on what is typically the biggest drinking night of the year.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will provide an additional $100 million in relief to businesses and residents expected to suffer during a two-week period of new restrictions starting Monday meant to control the current spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. Half of the federal stimulus money will be available for businesses that must close or will be severely limited during that period, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Raimondo said she wants businesses to use the money to continue to pay employees during the two-week pause. “The program that we have developed is meant to ensure that companies who are being put out of business or severely limited by the pause can get a check in their bank account quickly to help make up for the lost revenue of these two weeks,” she said. The other $50 million will go to provide an additional $400 to Rhode Islanders already collecting unemployment insurance benefits. She also reminded state residents who are in the U.S. illegally that they can apply for $400 debit cards through Dorcas International, a nonprofit that provides services to immigrants and refugees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: University of South Carolina President Bob Caslen said Wednesday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. Caslen said he tested positive Tuesday evening and is isolating at home, according to a news release, which added that he is asymptomatic. The test was administered through the university, which offers saliva-based and nasal swab testing to students, faculty and staff. “My diagnosis reinforces the need for everyone to get COVID tested regularly to protect yourself and your loved ones,” Caslen said in a statement. He had announced earlier this week that the university would institute monthly mandatory testing for students, faculty and staff who work on campus or are enrolled in at least one face-to-face or hybrid class. Those living, learning or working on the Columbia campus will also have to show proof of testing before returning to school in the spring. After reports of large crowds of students at Columbia bars, Caslen visited some establishments on Halloween night to see the conditions himself, WACH-TV reports. He also stopped by a neighborhood where thousands of students had gathered at an outdoor party earlier in the fall.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of one of the largest regional health systems in the Midwest was replaced Tuesday, less than a week after telling employees he had recovered from COVID-19 and was not wearing a mask around the office. Sanford Health said in a release that it has “mutually agreed to part ways” with longtime CEO Kelby Krabbenhoft, who took over in 1996 and helped expand the organization from a community hospital into what is billed as the nation’s largest rural nonprofit health system. Krabbenhoft left the executive position after telling employees in an email that he believes he’s now immune to COVID-19 for “at least seven months and perhaps years to come” and isn’t a threat to transmit it to anyone. He said wearing a mask would be merely for show. Other Sanford executives tried to distance themselves from the comments. Sanford Health, based in Sioux Falls, has 46 hospitals and more than 200 clinics concentrated in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. It employs about 50,000 people. The Dakotas have for weeks had the country’s worst spread rates of the coronavirus, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that COVID-19 vaccines will be optional in the state’s K-12 public schools, once they become available. The Republican said at a news conference that vaccines will be very important for Tennessee to “ultimately really be able to handle” the virus. But he said he doesn’t foresee COVID-19 mandates for school districts in Tennessee. “Vaccines are a choice, and people have the choice and will have the choice in this state as to whether or not they should take that vaccine,” Lee said. “That will be our strategy, and that is what we think will happen all across the state.” The comment comes as the state and the country look toward initial, limited doses of vaccine that could arrive in the next few weeks, amid a surge in the coronavirus that is increasingly straining hospital systems. In Tennessee, the first doses, likely through Pfizer, could arrive around Dec. 15, with the initial Moderna vaccines expected a week later, said state Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The value of oil fields in West Texas has plummeted due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused the demand for crude to go down. Eli Huffman, a land broker and attorney at Houston-based Lone Star Production Co., said he has seen land prices fall below $1,000 an acre for property that used to be worth more than $10,000 an acre. “When (oil) prices are too low, no one is buying land,” Huffman said. “Everybody is risk-averse at the moment.” The average price of U.S. shale acreage has fallen by more than 70% in two years – from $17,000 per acre in 2018 to $5,000 per acre in 2020, according to Norwegian energy research firm Rystad. Despite that, the prices of some shale plays has held up, the Houston Chronicle reports. The Permian-Delaware basin is still valued at $30,000 per acre, and the Midland basin is valued at $17,000 an acre, Rystad said. But prices for devalued oil and gas lands will not be able to bounce back as quickly if the pandemic worsens and lockdowns keep pressure on demand for petroleum.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Dixie State University said testing will be encouraged but not mandatory despite state health orders mandating college students get tested weekly for the coronavirus. “The truth is we don’t have enough tests to even test everyone,” said Jordon Sharp, vice president of marketing and communication at Dixie State. “Now, if that changes, then then we’ll see what happens.” Republican Gov. Gary Herbert issued health orders earlier this month requiring that college students get weekly COVID-19 tests starting no later than Jan. 1, KUER-FM reports. Sharp said the university received 2,000 kits, which it hoped to administer to students before Thanksgiving break, but that it is unlikely to happen because there are not enough tests to give to its 12,000 students. “There’s just really no process in place because we don’t have enough tests,” Sharp said. “So we’ll begin testing any student that would like (one).” Herbert said the goal is to screen 250,000 students a week at all the colleges and universities in the state, but the institutions are waiting for more equipment from the federal government.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A school district in Orange County is concerned about families not complying with quarantine rules after a cluster of coronavirus cases turned up in the district that serves Randolph, Braintree and Brookfield. The Orange Southwest School District has moved to remote learning but is encountering apathy from some people contacted during contact tracing, WCAX-TV reports. Superintendent Layne Millington estimates about a third of the families that were called discounted concerns about possible exposure or exposing others to the virus that causes COVID-19. “ ‘Didn’t care’ is probably a good expression for a lot of them,” Millington told WCAX-TV. “And then we had at least one family that had positive cases that said they were going to be noncompliant with the quarantine.” Gov. Phil Scott has said the state can impose penalties for people unwilling to comply with contact tracing requirements, but he’s reluctant to do that. “We don’t want to use our limited resources in public safety to go after people,” he said. “We’re asking people to tell the truth to protect others. I don’t think it’s tattling on anyone.”\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona: Recent accounts from inmates at Middle River Regional Jail have shed light on the growing threat of COVID-19, as inmates now find themselves bunking with the pandemic. Four nurses, 25 officers and 15 inmates had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Tuesday. A number of people are still quarantining at home, waiting for their test results, according to a press release from MRRJ. While officers and nurses have the option to avoid the crowd, the inmates don’t get that luxury. MRRJ conducted a spot test only on two housing units and people who showed symptoms. Kandi Harner, 32, tested positive and was told of the results Tuesday. She had been working a laundry job in the jail and said she was sent back to her pod after she suffered from nausea, a sore chest and an excruciating headache. Her pod consists of 35 women, 10 of whom tested positive. Harner said none of the 10 women were removed from the pod. “They still haven’t done anything for us or changed anything, short of giving us a mask,” Harner said by phone from the jail Tuesday. “This morning they tried to send me to work again, but I refused to go because I’m feeling so bad.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new report shows people infected with the coronavirus in the state’s most populous county in recent weeks have been mostly exposed in homes, during social activities and gatherings, and in workplaces. Instead of a few “hot spots,” the report shows the risk of exposure is now widespread throughout King County as cases have increased in the past two months. Public Health – Seattle & King County released the report on outbreaks and exposure settings Wednesday showing where people most frequently reported being exposed. Cases related to social activities and out-of-state travel have increased over the course of the pandemic, while cases associated with long-term care and other health care facilities have decreased in the county, according to the report. It also noted differences in potential sources of exposure by race and ethnicity, geography and age. In many communities of color, for example, particularly in south King County, workplaces are more frequently reported as possible exposure sites, the report said, whereas in the north Seattle and suburban Shoreline area, the most common exposure settings are social gatherings.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice blasted critics of his mask mandate Wednesday, saying he would not follow the lead of other Republican governors rejecting the advice of public health experts. “I don’t want to be South Dakota,” Justice said at a news conference. He then played a news clip from the state, where Gov. Kristi Noem has refused to issue a mask mandate, reporting that South Dakota has the most deaths per capita linked to COVID-19 in the world. There are 13 states currently without a statewide mask mandate in effect, all led by Republican governors. “I know that we are a strong-willed people in West Virginia, and we have our rights, and no one is trying to infringe on your rights in any way,” Justice said, a reference to some conservatives in the state who criticize his pandemic executive orders. Justice has vocally defended mask-wearing and recently tightened a mandate to wear one indoors when in public at all times, as cases have skyrocketed in rural enclaves. He has resisted more stringent lockdown measures and championed for schools to stay open where outbreaks are less severe.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in the state continued to tick downward Wednesday, a rare bit of good news for health officials as they struggle to contain the deadly disease. The state Department of Health Services reported 5,469 confirmed coronavirus cases Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases has now declined for five days, an encouraging sign after the state saw a record-high 7,989 cases Nov. 18. What’s more, the seven-day average of positive tests was 28.3% as of Tuesday, continuing a downward trend from a record-high 36.6% on Nov. 11. But the disease is still running rampant across the state. According to DHS, the total number of confirmed infections stood at 369,442 as of Wednesday. The disease was a factor in 63 more deaths, bringing the death toll to 3,178, according to the department. Wisconsin remains sixth in the nation in per-capita infections, according to Johns Hopkins University. And any progress against the disease appears fleeting. Health officials are bracing for another surge in infections and deaths stemming from Thanksgiving gatherings.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials in northern Wyoming have voted to remove Dr. Ed Zimmerman from his position as Washakie County health officer, a decision Zimmerman believes is in response to his implementing a mask mandate. Washakie County Commission Chair Fred Frandson said Tuesday that Zimmerman’s departure was not a result of the local mask mandate but said he could not discuss why he was removed because the county does not publicly discuss personnel matters, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Zimmerman said there were several health officials who were worried they could lose their jobs by implementing mask mandates. “It had to do with the health order in some way,” Zimmerman said of losing his job. Zimmerman said he met with the county’s three commissioners Nov. 17 to discuss the forthcoming mandate and said the commissioners “were really, really not happy with me” about the decision. Zimmerman said he then received a call on Monday from Frandson informing him that his contract was terminated and that all his duties would end immediately.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/27"}]}

Disappointing results for the party in upcoming polls could also heap more pressure on Johnson, as Conservatives face two difficult parliamentary by-elections in late June.\n\nDespite the victory, the opposition Labour Party has said that by hanging onto power this time, Johnson makes the prospect of an early election even more likely. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer predicted to LBC that Monday’s vote would mark “the beginning of the end” of the Prime Minister’s political career – no matter which way the vote went.\n\n“If you look at the previous examples of no confidence votes, even when Conservative Prime Ministers survive those … the damage is already done,” the opposition leader told LBC Monday. “Usually, they fall reasonably swiftly afterwards.”\n\nFollowing the vote, Starmer said Johnson was “utterly unfit for the great office he holds” and accused Conservative lawmakers of ignoring the British public. “The Conservative Government now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law.”\n\nScotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Johnson an “utterly lame duck” on Twitter following the vote.\n\n“That result is surely the worst of all worlds for the Tories. But much more importantly: at a time of huge challenge, it saddles the UK with an utterly lame duck PM,” Sturgeon said in a tweet on Monday night.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'No way out': Commentator predicts Boris Johnson's future 02:10 - Source: CNN 'No way out': Commentator predicts Boris Johnson's future 02:10\n\nJohnson’s predecessor Theresa May was the last sitting British leader to face a no-confidence vote from their own party. May narrowly survived that vote, which had been called amid months of chaos over her doomed Brexit deal – but she ultimately resigned months later.\n\nMonday’s vote was triggered after more than 54 lawmakers sent letters to the chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, following a tidal wave of criticism over a number of scandals that have engulfed Johnson’s premiership for several months.\n\nLast month, a damning report by a senior civil servant found a culture of partying and socializing among Johnson’s staff during Covid-19 lockdown, while millions of Britons were banned from seeing their friends and relatives.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nThe so-called Partygate scandal plunged his approval ratings and sparked a drumbeat of dissatisfaction among several of his backbenchers. But Johnson has also been criticized for his response to a cost-of-living crisis, and his party suffered heavy losses at local elections in May.\n\nUnder Conservative party rules – which can be changed at any time – a leader who survives a confidence vote is safe from such a challenge for 12 months.\n\nBut with only 58.6% of Conservative MPs backing Johnson on Monday, the Prime Minister suffered a worse result than his predecessor May, who had the support of 63% of her lawmakers in a much smaller parliamentary party when she faced a confidence vote in 2018.\n\nDespite the worse performance, Johnson insisted it was an “extremely good” result, saying he was not interested in a snap election to gain a new mandate from the public.", "authors": ["Tara John Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta Luke Mcgee", "Tara John", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/asia/john-lee-hong-kong-chief-executive-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "John Lee, Hong Kong's next leader, is a hardline former police ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nAs night fell, chaos erupted when crowds of protesters outside Hong Kong’s legislative building hurled bottles at police, who fired pepper spray and swung batons, dragging some people to the ground.\n\nIt was a shocking descent into violence from what began as a peaceful march, attended by more than a million people by some estimates – roughly one in seven of the city’s population -- to oppose a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China.\n\nIt was June 9, 2019 – and Hong Kong was about to change forever, as it plunged into months of mass protests, bloody street battles and an unprecedented crackdown by authorities that saw Beijing tighten its grip on the city with a sweeping national security law.\n\nLast week, the man who led the crackdown stepped onto a stage to lay out his vision for Hong Kong – this time not as the city’s security chief, but its next leader.\n\nJohn Lee speaking at an interview in Hong Kong on September 17, 2021. Chen Yongnuo/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nJohn Lee, who became the face of the national security law and who oversaw the arrests of dozens of activists and raids on newsrooms, is set to replace outgoing Chief Executive Carrie Lam when she finishes her five-year term at the end of June.\n\nIn what the government billed as an “open, just and honest” election, a largely government-appointed, pro-Beijing committee of 1,461 people appointed the next leader for the city’s 7.5 million residents on Sunday. Lee was the only person in the running, in contrast to previous years that saw run-offs between multiple candidates.\n\nFor many, Lee’s ascension speaks volumes about the direction Hong Kong – once world-renowned for its robust press, flourishing civil society and democratic aspirations – is headed. Lee has already indicated that he will look to introduce further national security legislation and possibly a law against fake news.\n\nTo Nathan Law, a human rights activist and former local lawmaker now in self-exile in Britain, it seems “very obvious” why Lee is tipped for the role.\n\n“It really signals (authorities) are intensifying that heavy-handed approach to Hong Kong, and putting the so-called national security as their policy for governing the city,” Law said.\n\nA rise years in the making\n\nThe forces behind Lee’s rise to the city’s top job can be traced back nearly half a century.\n\nLee joined the Hong Kong police force as a 19-year-old recruit in 1977 as the city – then a British colony – underwent an economic transformation into a modern financial center.\n\nHe rose through the ranks and was promoted to chief superintendent in 1997 – the same year Britain handed the city to China in a pomp-filled ceremony watched around the world.\n\nSince that watershed year, activists like Law say they have watched Hong Kong’s freedoms be squeezed ever tighter. All the while, Lee continued gaining prominence, becoming deputy commissioner, the second-highest position in the police force, by 2010.\n\nA woman reacts to pepper spray as police were clearing protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday, July 1.

To some, the appointment of a high-ranking police officer to a key government office was a statement of intent.\n\n“We were already really nervous about that, because that really signaled a change in Hong Kong’s policy, changing it in a seemingly more suppressive way,” Law said.\n\nBy 2016, when Law was elected into the legislature, Lee “was already notoriously difficult to deal with” and seemed hostile to any journalists or opposition lawmakers who raised questions or challenges, Law said.\n\nLee’s supporters have disputed this characterization, maintaining his time in the police force helped prepare him for a public office.\n\nOne pro-Beijing lawmaker, Ma Fung-kwok, said Lee had demonstrated “leadership skills” in his handling of the protests and the pandemic, according to public broadcaster RTHK. Another, Jeffrey Lam, said Lee had “solved many cases” in the police force and can cooperate with “other sectors in the society.”\n\nAt a brief political rally on Friday, Lee, whose slogan is “We and us – a new chapter together,” stressed the importance of community and promised to “make Hong Kong a place of hope” once appointed.\n\nCNN has reached out to Lee’s campaign team for comment.\n\nThe 2019 protests\n\nLee’s rise continued when he was appointed security chief in 2017 – the “beginning of a changing trend,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired Hong Kong academic and pro-democracy activist now based in New Zealand.\n\n“Beijing seems to be emphasizing loyalty more, or the capability of implementing a hard line – therefore, senior officials from the disciplinary forces appear to occupy a more advantageous position,” Cheng said.\n\nIt was under Lee’s tenure that the Security Bureau introduced the controversial extradition bill that led to the protests in 2019.\n\nCritics worried Beijing could use the bill to prosecute Hong Kong residents for political reasons under China’s opaque legal system.\n\nProtesters march against a proposed extradition bill on June 16, 2019 in Hong Kong. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nWith the Hong Kong government standing firm on the bill despite public objections, the protests quickly expanded into a broader pro-democracy, anti-government movement. Fears were underpinned by widespread anxiety about Beijing’s growing influence and the perceived erosion of Hong Kong’s cherished semi-autonomous status, which allowed it the freedoms of press, speech and assembly that had long been central to its international appeal.\n\nWithdrawing the bill was just one of five popular demands by protesters; others included universal suffrage and accountability from police, who faced accusations of brutality they have denied.\n\nAt the height of the crisis, protesters and police clashed nearly every week, with demonstrators lobbing bricks and Molotov cocktails and officers responding with tear gas, rubber bullets, and at times live ammunition. The violence polarized the city, cementing the breakdown in trust between the public and the authorities.\n\nA protester throws back a tear gas canister fired by police in Hong Kong on October 1, 2019. ISAAC LAWRENCE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThrough it all, Lee praised his officers as “courageous” and condemned protesters as “radicals” who were sowing “terror.” When hundreds of protesters – many high school students – occupied a university for more than a week, police laid siege to the campus with Lee declaring: “We will arrest them all.”\n\nLee has repeatedly defended the force’s actions, insisting critics need to “think about the (preceding events), otherwise it will not be fair.”\n\n“I am proud of the Hong Kong police force. They remain Asia’s finest … Compared to what they do with law enforcement agencies overseas, I think they have exercised restraint. They have minimized the harm and injuries to everybody,” he said in September 2019.\n\nLong arm of the national security law\n\nLee gained local prominence for his role in combating the protests – but his implementation of the national security law cemented his reputation as a hardline enforcer and Beijing loyalist.\n\nThe security law was promulgated by Beijing in June 2020, during a lull in the protests brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. Described by the Hong Kong government at the time as “a crucial step to ending chaos,” the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces – and allows for maximum sentences of life imprisonment.\n\nIn an instant, Hong Kong’s social and political landscape was transformed, and within months, many of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures were either in jail or exile.\n\nPolice officers raid the Apple Daily headquarters in Hong Kong on August 10, 2020. Apple Daily/AP\n\nUnder the security law, Lee oversaw the mass arrest of opposition figures in 2021, accusing them of trying to “paralyze the Hong Kong government” by organizing a pro-democracy primary election.\n\nHe ordered a police raid on Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, which was subsequently forced to shut after its assets were frozen and several employees arrested under the security law.\n\nA week after the raid, Lee was promoted to chief secretary – the second-highest position in government – and the first time a security official has taken the role.\n\nExperts say Lee’s suppression of the protests and support for national security is precisely why he now finds himself the city’s next leader.\n\n“(This is) the reward for loyalty,” said Cheng, the activist and former academic.\n\nSupporters of the security law insist it has helped establish stability in the wake of the violence and political unrest of 2019. “People’s lives and property are protected, and they can once again enjoy their legitimate rights and freedoms,” a government spokesperson said in April in response to a question on the law.\n\nBut Lee’s association with the law has been met with increasing scrutiny abroad. He was among nearly a dozen people sanctioned by the US in 2020 for undermining the city’s autonomy and democratic processes – which Lee has scoffed at, recently calling the sanctions “unreasonable” and “acts of bullying.”\n\nHe has also continued to defend the law, as well as recent electoral changes that placed him at the head of a vetting committee to screen all candidates, ensuring only “patriots” would be allowed to run for office.\n\nThe national security law “has restored peace,” Lee told the United Nations Human Rights Council in March, decrying the 2019 protests as “evil” and lauding “the improved electoral system.”\n\n“No country has a monopoly on the model of democracy,” he added.\n\nWhat this means for Hong Kong\n\nLee has already made clear the kind of government he will shape: one with increasingly close ties to mainland China.\n\nAt the unveiling of his policy manifesto on April 29, Lee emphasized the need to integrate Hong Kong with other economically important Chinese cities. There was no English translation provided, despite English being one of Hong Kong’s two official languages – in striking contrast to most government events to date.\n\nHe also vowed to bolster security legislation and introduce “national identity” education. Both proposals have long been controversial, with previous attempts to introduce legislation foiled by protests and pushback – much to Beijing’s frustration.\n\nLee has also previously voiced support for a “fake news” law – prompting fears the reins will only tighten on what remains of the city’s media and civil groups. Last week, the city’s press freedom ranking plunged to a record low of 148 among 180 locations, compared to its ranking of 73rd in 2019.\n\nDespite this, the outgoing Chief Executive Lam continues to claim that Hong Kong’s media sphere is “as vibrant as ever,” though she warned last week that “media organizations are not above the law … including the national security law.”\n\nLee will also have to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, with patience fraying among many in Hong Kong after more than two years of stringent restrictions in accordance with China’s unbending zero-Covid policy.\n\nAt his policy manifesto event, Lee asserted that “at some point (the virus) will be under control,” and that he would design measures to allow businesses to operate.\n\nCheng, the pro-democracy activist who moved to New Zealand, sees the future as being “the continuation of the hard line of the past two years.”\n\n“There is no toleration of political opposition … there will be very little tolerance of an independent media, and very little tolerance for the operation of civil society organizations,” Cheng said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about accusations of diminished political freedoms, a government spokesperson responded that the rights of Hong Kong residents are “protected in accordance with the law” – but that “many freedoms and rights are not absolute, and can be restricted for reasons including protection of national security and public safety.”\n\nDisillusionment and emigration\n\nAmong former activists and pro-democracy supporters, there’s a sense of despair as Lee prepares to take office.\n\nThe circumstances of his selection, with Lee as the sole contender showered with praise by pro-Beijing lawmakers, cut particularly deep for many of those who once marched to demand greater democratic freedoms.\n\n“It’s definitely not, by any means or any parameters, a democratic (process),” said Law, the former lawmaker. “It’s really just an appointment. I don’t really call it an election.”\n\nLee has dodged questions about whether he was handpicked by the central Chinese government, saying in April he welcomed anybody else who wished to run.\n\nHe has since received endorsements from leading establishment figures, including two former police commissioners and two former security chiefs, RTHK reported.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the past three years, even a new administration is unlikely to bridge the broken relationship between the government and its people, said John Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n“There is a huge percentage of the population that is alienated and angry,” he said, pointing to mass emigration as “evidence of alienation … of a sick society.”\n\nLocals, expatriates and foreign companies are leaving the city in droves. More than 100,000 Hong Kongers applied for a new visa offering a path to citizenship in Britain last year; and in February and March alone this year, more than 180,000 people left the city while only about 39,000 entered, according to immigration data.\n\nWhile Hong Kong’s harsh Covid restrictions are helping drive this exodus, Lee’s critics say that so too is the crackdown on civil liberties he enforced.\n\nAsked about this on April 29, Lee brushed it off. He claimed Hong Kong had always seen high levels of mobility, and that its proximity to the mainland market would continue to attract businesses.\n\n“We are an inclusive city,” he told reporters. “Together, we start a new chapter for Hong Kong.”", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/asia/hong-kong-25th-anniversary-xi-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Analysis: China's Xi Jinping brought Hong Kong to heel. Now he's ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nChinese flags flutter above streets and red celebratory banners line the harbor front, as a beaming crowd of masked officials and school children wave and chant in unison inside Hong Kong’s high-speed rail terminus, welcoming the arrival of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nIn his first trip outside mainland China since the start of the pandemic, Xi arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to mark the 25th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on July 1 – a highly symbolic event at a pivotal time for both the city, and Xi himself.\n\nThe former British colony is midway through the 50-year promise of “a high degree of autonomy,” given by Beijing under a framework known as “one country, two systems.” It is also swearing in its newly appointed leader, hardline former police officer John Lee.\n\nXi, meanwhile, is only months away from finishing his first decade in power – and is widely expected to seek an unprecedented third term at a key meeting of the ruling Communist Party this fall.\n\nThe two-day trip is a timely declaration of political victory for Xi, who has brought Hong Kong to heel with a sweeping national security law following the 2019 anti-government protests. In just two years, critics say, the law has been used to crush the city’s opposition movement, overhaul its electoral system, silence its outspoken media and cripple its once-vibrant civil society.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has repeatedly denied the national security law is suppressing freedoms. Instead, it insists the law has ended chaos and restored stability to the city.\n\nPeople wave Chinese and Hong Kong flags as fishing boats carrying banners celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China sail through the Victoria Harbour. Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor an authoritarian leader obsessed with stability, Hong Kong may now feel more like home than ever. Unlike his previous visits to the city, Xi no longer needs to worry about any public expression of dissent – be it critical headlines on local newspaper front pages, protest slogans on billboards or mass rallies in the streets.\n\nInstead, he is set to be surrounded by only “patriotic” officials, loyal tycoons and a blanket of heavy security measures – including extensive roadblocks and a citywide ban on drones. He will be separated from the public by a meticulously maintained “closed loop” system – put in place to protect him against the city’s rising Covid-19 infections.\n\nIn a sign of the heightened security, journalists from at least seven media organizations, including CNN, were blocked from covering the ceremony days before the event, after initially receiving accreditation.\n\nBeijing’s supporters say Hong Kong has ushered in a “new era of stability, prosperity and opportunity.”\n\n“This is an important milestone for our nation and Hong Kong,” the city’s government said in a statement marking the anniversary. “(It) not only captures Hong Kong’s impressive achievements over the past two and a half decades, it also underscores our eager anticipation for and confidence in a brighter future.”\n\nBut critics fear Hong Kong is being increasingly reshaped in China’s image. To some, the “one country, two systems” experiment is already dead – 25 years ahead of schedule.\n\nIn 2019, a proposed bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China from Hong Kong plunged the city into months of social unrest. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\n“One country, two systems”\n\nProposed by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, “one country, two systems” is a political formula originally intended to help China achieve unification with Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy with a capitalist economy. But it ended up being first applied to Hong Kong, with the hope that it would set a desirable example for Taiwan to follow later.\n\nThe governance model allows a capitalist bubble to coexist within a socialist country, with a pledge that Hong Kong’s capitalist system and way-of-life will remain unchanged for 50 years.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher visited Beijing in 1984 to sign the Sino-British Joint Declaration for the handover of Hong Kong, Deng assured the British Prime Minister that “China will always keep its promises.”\n\n“When we gave the figure of 50 years, we were not speaking casually or on impulse, but in consideration of the realities in China and of our need for development,” he told Thatcher.\n\nUpon his arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, Xi called the “one country, two systems” a “good system.”\n\n“Facts have proved that ‘one country, two systems’ has strong vitality. It can ensure Hong Kong’s long-term prosperity and stability, and safeguard the well-being of Hong Kong compatriots,” Xi said inside the West Kowloon Station.\n\n“Over the past few years, Hong Kong has withstood one severe test after another and overcome one risk and challenge after another. After weathering the storms, Hong Kong has emerged from the ashes with vigorous vitality,” he said.\n\nBut critics, including Hong Kong’s last British governor Chris Patten, have accused Beijing of breaching those promises in recent years as it tightened its grip on Hong Kong.\n\n“It’s fair to say for 10 years after 1997, maybe a bit longer, things did not go too badly wrong, but they’ve gone downhill since, partly because Xi Jinping and his colleagues are terrified of what Hong Kong actually stands for,” Patten said at a press conference last week.\n\nFight for democracy\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has waged an ideological war against the influence of “Western values” such as constitutional democracy, press freedom, judicial independence and universal human rights – notions that have long been cherished in Hong Kong and formed an integral part of its identity.\n\nThe city’s pursuit of full democracy, namely ultimately electing its leader by universal suffrage – a goal written into its mini-constitution, the Basic Law – is especially viewed with suspicion by Beijing, which is worried that a freely elected leader could pose a challenge to its authority.\n\nAs Beijing dragged its feet on electoral reforms, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy advocates lost patience. In 2014, thousands of young protesters occupied key roads in the city’s financial center to demand “true universal suffrage” – rejecting a proposal by China’s parliament to have the candidates vetted in advance by a pro-Beijing committee. The peaceful protests, known as the “Umbrella Movement,” ended after 79 days, with none of their demands met.\n\nSince then, Beijing has sought to exert more control over Hong Kong. During his first visit to the city as China’s leader in 2017, Xi warned that any efforts to “challenge the power” of the central government were “absolutely impermissible.”\n\n“Any attempt to endanger China’s sovereignty and security…or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line,” he said in a speech on Hong Kong’s 20th handover anniversary.\n\nBut Beijing’s tightening grip only intensified discontent in the city, especially among its younger generation – many of whom fear they are running out of time to fight for democracy before the 2047 deadline.\n\nSome tried to push for change by joining the city’s legislature, but that failed too under increasing pressure from Beijing. A slew of pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified over an oath-taking controversy, while other candidates were barred from standing for office.\n\nLong-running tensions eventually erupted in 2019. Over that summer, peaceful marches against a proposed bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China soon snowballed into sometimes violent anti-Beijing protests, plunging the city into months of social unrest and its most tumultuous period since the handover.\n\nA year later, during a lull in the protests brought by the pandemic, Beijing bypassed the city’s legislature to impose a national security law, which took effect the day before the July 1 handover anniversary. In vaguely defined terms, the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces – and allows for maximum sentences of life imprisonment.\n\nA riot policeman sprays pepper spray at a man as they disperse a crowd during a demonstration against \"parallel traders\" who buy goods in Hong Kong to resell in mainland China on Sunday, January 5.

Dale De La Rey/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: Hong Kong unrest Prev Next\n\nHong Kong’s transformation\n\nSince then, crackdown measures that would have been previously unthinkable have arrived at a dizzying speed, drastically transforming Hong Kong’s political and social landscape.\n\nNearly all of the city’s leading pro-democracy figures, including activists and politicians, have either been jailed or forced into exile. No opposition lawmakers are left in the legislature, which now allows only “patriots” to run for office.\n\nThe city’s most outspoken newspaper, Apple Daily, has been shuttered, followed by a number of smaller pro-democracy outlets, while dozens of civil society groups, from unions and churches to activist groups, have disbanded. Memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, from statues to annual commemoration vigils, are being erased from public spaces.\n\nTens of thousands of citizens are voting with their feet, emigrating to democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\n\nResponding to CNN’s request for comment on the city’s diminishing freedoms, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said: “Many freedoms and rights are not absolute, and can be restricted for reasons including protection of national security and public safety.”\n\nBut Xi’s transformation of Hong Kong is not only about chipping away the freedoms it once had – it also seeks to reshape the city in China’s image and connect it more deeply with the motherland.\n\nStarting from this year, schools, including some kindergartens, are required to hold a ceremony to raise the national flag at least once a week, where the national anthem must be played and sung.\n\nIn classrooms, national security education has been introduced to the curriculum to “develop in students a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity,” while books by pro-democracy figures, or others that are deemed politically sensitive, have been removed from the shelves of public libraries.\n\nHong Kong police are now adopting the goose-stepping marching style of the Chinese army, abandoning the British style they have used since the colonial area.\n\nHong Kong police officers perform a new goose-stepping march, the same style used by the Chinese military, to mark the National Security Education Day in Hong Kong on April 15, 2021. ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDays ahead of the 25th handover ceremony, the Wong Tai Sin temple, a Taoist shrine popular with local worshipers, became the first religious premise to hold a flag-raising ceremony in Hong Kong, after building a permanent platform for the Chinese and Hong Kong flags. Under Xi, Chinese flags have become ubiquitous at temples, churches and mosques across mainland China.\n\nHong Kong officials speak proudly of efforts to embed Hong Kong deeper into China’s national economic master plans, including developing the Greater Bay Area – a region Beijing hopes will one day rival the bay areas of San Francisco, New York and Tokyo.\n\nIn 2018, Xi officiated the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the longest sea-crossing bridge ever built. The same year, the West Kowloon Station opened, connecting Hong Kong with the mainland by high-speed rail.\n\nSince the pandemic, however, both projects have lain mostly idle, due to strict border controls between Hong Kong and mainland China – the last places in the world still adhering to a stringent zero-Covid strategy.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Xi is expected to cross that border at least three times in his two-day trip, as he plans to spend the night in Shenzhen – without being subject to centralized quarantine like ordinary travelers.\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in Hong Kong, thousands of officials, guests and staff have begun quarantining in the city’s hotels since Wednesday, merely to attend the ceremony.\n\nXi’s visit may be historic on many fronts, but for many Hong Kongers, his presence will only confirm how much has changed in so little time.", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}]}

It is a place where glaciers and salmon abound, where massive trees born thousands of years before litter the valley floor and wild blueberry plants cover the mountainsides. By the end of three and a half days, we would find ourselves traversing through sixty miles of the some of the most isolated terrain in the contiguous United States. We would see barely a handful of people by the time we walked over the Ross Lake Dam less than a mile from our car.\n\n\n\nOn this particular day, I had decided to hike a few minutes ahead of the group out of camp in the morning and wait for them to catch up. But by the time I ascended the roughly 1,000 feet through Big Beaver Pass on a one-way trail to Ross Lake, the contemplative silence of the forest called me to just keep walking until I reached our destination on the shores of the massive reservoir. For 16 miles, I heard nothing but the sounds of my own perceptions uniting with that of the flora and fauna. I thought about Amy and the kids, who were celebrating an outdoor Mass with my extended family at a family reunion. I pondered all that had occurred up to that point in the year, and that which would come before 2016 was no more. I reflected upon those whom I had seen recently as well as those not seen in some time.\n\n\n\nBut more than anything, I contemplated the enormous beauty and silence that engrossed me. In what I surmised later was the longest (waking) time I had gone without seeing another human being, each hour brought a surge of joy and contentment that belied the painful blisters on my feet. Any worry or uncertainty from the morning had long subsided, and my body seemed to merge with the landscape.In my isolation, I was anything but alone.I was liberated into a dimension where my serenity was acutely correlated to the supreme consciousness that I felt. I was free to contemplate the point at which humanity met divinity, a place where creativity was as palpable as the artistic brilliance of the forest around me. I had found the silence in my soul.\n\n\n\nFor as long as humanity has lived, people have sought out silence in their daily lives. Whether in adventure or contemplation or prayer or rejuvenation or adoration, humans have always intuitively known that regular silence is a necessity of life. More recently, though, science has discovered that all human beings need silence more than we probably know. As illuminated in a recent Medical Daily article, benefits extend beyond the obvious opportunities silence provides for rest, creativity, awareness, and discovery. Studies find that walking alone multiple times a week increases hippocampal growth, leading to improved memory. Those who allow even just two minutes of complete silence have positive changes in blood circulation and blood pressure associated with decreased tension. Older adults who meditate in complete silence each day demonstrate improved sleep patterns and decreased depression and fatigue.Not speaking for extended periods of times is associated with heightened sensitivity in other areas, such as thinking, feeling, and overall sensory perceptions.\n\n\n\nDespite all the benefits that silence promises, though, it is easy to see that we do not live in a time and culture that supports its pursuit as a necessary venture.It is easy to see that for many people in different places, silence is a feared and uncomfortable entity, whether it is the worry that it will lead to a communication being missed or a thought or feeling least desired. Some sounds may be more difficult to control, like that of the cars rolling by my front window or the three conversations occurring as I write (although some would argue I could move to a quieter place or had fewer kids).\n\n\n\nIt is easy to blame our noisy existence on the technological changes that have occurred. But much of the noise that remains is of our own immediate choosing.In our daily choices, and those that we make for our kids, the subject of silence deserves an audible consideration. For even beyond the science and wisdom of generations past which convey its utmost importance, there is a mysteriousness that beckons us to bear in mind that it might be even more essential than we know. It begs us to consider that while the greatest risk of the technological climate might be the loss of our silent prerogative, the inverse might still be true. All of us spend much of our day understandably engaged in routinized actions, and at times we respond instinctively to situations that demand an immediate response. Still, the value of our decisions often remains predicated on how we handle, or allow for, the periods of silence that precede them.\n\n\n\nThe more people lose silence, the less they will discern the decisions they make, which increasingly threaten to become little more than a reaction to the noise around and inside of them. As Thomas Merton once said,\n\n\n\n“When society is made up of men who know no interior solitude, it can no longer be held together by love: and consequently it is held together by a violent and abusive authority.”\n\n\n\nYet when silence becomes a close friend, a greater consciousness emerges that is the seed of great growth. At times, silence breeds a painful acknowledgment; at times, a joyful surge; at times, a novel awareness long overdue. For if we are honest with ourselves, quietness precedes a necessary connection to a world that transcends an automatic response to our own fears and desires. We become liberated to do what is needed — to give what we should give, to receive what we should receive, to love whom we should love. Only in silence, are we free to be who we are called to be. Only in silence.\n\n\n\nThe next segment, Part II: Finding ways to embrace silence in our everyday lives will appear on Feb. 3.\n\nJames Schroeder is a husband and father of six children and a pediatric psychologist.

Can Samantha rationalize the impossibility of the relationship with the memory of their perfect date?\n\n“Flirting Lessons” by Jasmine Guillory (April 8)\n\nThis is the first sapphic romance novel from the author of “The Wedding Date” and “The Proposal.” Guillory’s “Flirting Lessons” is about a 30-something, fresh off the heels of a breakup and looking for something more.

An old professor of mine, Morrie Schwartz, was on the “Nightline” program, talking to Ted Koppel.\n\nAbout dying.\n\nMy mouth dropped. Morrie was more than a former teacher. He was closer to a favorite old uncle, a smiling, gentle mentor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts who saw in me a flawed but salvageable young man.\n\nWe’d been extremely close. I took every class he offered. I ate lunch with him. I visited his home. He spoke to me about life, values, love, community. He listened patiently to my silly collegiate complaints; I majored in sociology, his field, mostly so I could study with him all four years.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead excerpt from Mitch Albom's new 'Tuesdays With Morrie' afterword\n\nOn graduation day, he gave me a hug. “Mitch,” he said, “you’re one of the good ones. Promise me you’ll stay in touch.”\n\nI said I would.\n\nAnd then I broke that promise. Every day, week, month and year — for 16 years. Not a letter. Not a phone call. Why? Ambition. Self-absorption. A belief that work — like this column at this newspaper — always came first, and everything else could wait.\n\nWhat I ignored was the essence of that famous Emily Dickinson poem, “Because I could not stop for Death, he kindly stopped for me.”\n\nDeath stopped for Morrie.\n\nAnd it threw something in my direction.\n\nStill learning\n\nMorrie and I reconnected before he died. We met regularly. And two decades later, I am still telling the story. I’ve seen it turned into a TV film made by Oprah Winfrey as well as an off-Broadway play produced more than 100 times globally. On Tuesday, the 20th anniversary edition of “Tuesdays With Morrie” will be released, a tiny book I wrote about our experience that grew beyond anyone’s imagination. I’ve added a new and final chapter because I am still, decades later, trying to process what transpired.\n\nWhat transpired, in simple order, was this: I saw the “Nightline” program. I made a guilty phone call. I made a visit to Morrie’s home. Then another visit. Another visit. Then visits on every Tuesday that Morrie had left in his life. Like cold hands to fire, I was drawn to Morrie, seeking his warmth, and with each plane trip from Detroit to Boston, I felt the crust of who I’d become peeling off in favor of who I’d once been: a student, anxious to hear an old teacher’s wisdom.\n\nAnd boy, did Morrie have wisdom.\n\nLessons so far\n\nEven as his disease, ALS, chewed on his nervous system, leaving him a stiff, motionless husk needing to be carried from place to place, needing to be washed, fed, even wiped on his behind, he taught. He shared his experience. He had visitors turn his head so he could see them, and he spoke, and they listened, and he discovered a purpose to his awful affliction:\n\nA final class on the Meaning Of Life.\n\nI was his student. Week after week, I brought up a topic, and Morrie gave his views — not based on readings or footnotes, but on life experience. It proved to be the best form of research.\n\nRelated:\n\nRead excerpt from Mitch Albom's new 'Tuesdays With Morrie' afterword\n\nBecause he lost his mother as a child, and never really got over it, Morrie cherished his own children and taught me, “There is no secure ground upon which people may stand if it isn’t the family.”\n\nBecause he watched his graduates chase after advertised values, only to return to him miserable and unsatisfied, Morrie taught me, “Don’t buy the culture if you don’t like it.”\n\nBecause he lost touch with a friend over a silly argument, then wept when he learned the man had died, Morrie taught me, “Forgive everyone everything. Now.”\n\nAnd because he saw the struggles of so many, then suffered a catastrophic struggle of his own, Morrie recognized life was a “tension of opposites” with forces pulling you in conflicting directions.\n\n“Which side wins?” I once asked him.\n\n“Love wins,” he said. “Love always wins.”\n\nForce of change\n\nAt one point in our visits, I asked Morrie what he feared the most with his dying. His answer surprised me. “The debt I’m going to leave my family,” he said. He explained that the cost of dying slowly, at home, had sapped his savings, and that his wife and sons would be burdened with payments after he was gone.\n\nThat was the impetus for me writing “Tuesdays With Morrie.” Simply to pay his bills. The book idea was not well-received. Many publishers shook their heads; it was boring, they said, it was depressing. I was a sports writer. Who’d want to read it? In truth, if it hadn’t been for Morrie’s need, I would have given up.\n\nInstead, I kept knocking on doors until we found a publisher, Doubleday, that wanted to take the book. When I told Morrie he didn’t have to worry anymore about burdening his family with debt, he cried (something he did fairly often). And I felt something funny inside me, something Morrie knew very well: the joy of helping another person.\n\nI often say, for me, that was the end of Tuesdays With Morrie, because I had finally done one nice thing for a man who had done countless nice things for me. Perhaps, as thick-headed as I’d been, some of Morrie’s teachings were finally seeping in.\n\nBut if I was done with the idea, it was only getting started with me. The book that began, in 1997, with a meager 20,000-copy print run, has swelled to an unimaginable reach — nearly 50 countries and more than 40 languages. And like any good teacher who forces you to look at life differently, the book changed me.\n\nI went from being a 100-hour-a-week sports journalist to someone asked to speak at funerals, at hospice groups, at universities, at the bedside of dying patients. Instead of people stopping me at airports yelling, “Who’s going to win the Super Bowl?” I’d get stopped by questions like, “My mother just died from cancer, and the last thing we did was read ‘Tuesdays With Morrie’ together. Can I talk to you?”\n\nSuch encounters change you. They should change you. They make you realize how fleeting life can be, how precious our human connections really are, how vacuous so much of what we pursue and obsess over really is.\n\nIn that way, I guess, I am Morrie’s eternal graduate student, destined to retake his last class every year.\n\nBut it did not stop there.\n\nWhat matters, what is true\n\nMorrie’s favorite little allegory was about two waves, flopping around, having a great time, until one of them spots the coastline.\n\n“This is terrible,” the first wave says.\n\n“What is?” says the second.\n\n“We’re going to hit the shore. You don’t understand. All of us waves are going to be nothing.”\n\n“No, you don’t understand. You’re not a wave, you’re part of the ocean.”\n\nWhen Morrie’s life ended, when his wave hit the shore, he did indeed filter back into the human ocean. And his teachings have affected millions. His words are being taught in classrooms as far away as the Philippines and as near as a high school in Grand Blanc, where I recently Skyped with a class studying “Tuesdays With Morrie” as part of its curriculum.\n\nAll these lessons being learned — and Morrie isn’t even here to teach them. What I’ve realized is that the effect you have in this world is not in your wealth or your place on a magazine’s Top 100 list; it’s in every soul you touch and every young one you teach.\n\nIt is the reason you often read me writing about children in Detroit, or an orphanage/mission I operate in Haiti. I am drawn to children, as a middle-age man, the way I was drawn to Morrie as a younger one.\n\nMaybe that’s the way Morrie was drawn to me.\n\nIn the afterword for the new edition of “Tuesdays,” I mention a little Haitian girl that my wife and I have been taking care of for nearly two years. She is afflicted with DIPG, a terrible brain tumor that is virtually always fatal. It’s the same thing that took young Chad Carr in 2015.\n\nHer name is Chika, she is 7 years old, one of our kids at the orphanage, and while modern medicine was able to give her months of wonderful reprieve where she laughed and danced and sang and enthralled us, she is in very dire straits now.\n\nAnd once more in my life, I find myself sitting beside a soul who has little time left. Once more, I am missing work to be at a bedside — not just on Tuesdays, but every day of the week. And once again, I am learning about love, meaning and sacrifice.\n\nMaybe this is my role in life. Maybe it’s just coincidence. But 20 years after it was published, I reread the last words of “Tuesdays With Morrie”:\n\n“The teaching goes on.”\n\nIt is so true.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

Consequently, books for holiday gift-giving may be harder to come by this year.\n\nIronically and also because of COVID-19, many new titles were delayed from 2020 and given release dates in 2021, so there are more riches than ever in new fiction and nonfiction titles. Bookstores have been scrambling to put their purchase orders in as early as possible and are hoping for the best — that copies arrive in time for gift-buying customers.\n\n“We’ve been getting warnings from publishers: place your bets now because it’s a supply-chain issue,” said Debbie Boggs, buyer and manager of Gramercy Books in Bexley. “There are no printers, no paper, no containers coming from overseas, no trucks.”\n\nA summer shortage of lumber made paper pulp and cardboard scarce. Additionally, there are only a few physical plants in the United States that print books — (most are done overseas, especially in China) — and some of the American plants went out of business during the pandemic.\n\n“Books are sitting in shipping containers in ports halfway around the world,” Boggs said.\n\nAmazon.com will have less difficulty than brick-and-mortar stores and e-books should be OK, but statistics in a recent article in Forbes magazine show that 65 percent of adult American readers prefer physical books to e-books and audiobooks.\n\nChildren’s titles are mostly produced in physical books.\n\nBrian Loar, manager of Cover to Cover Books for Young Readers in Upper Arlington, said that many children’s books, too, were delayed in 2020 and that “we’re still seeing titles pushed back.\n\n“It becomes really difficult when you’re buying for the holidays,” he said. “If I see a title that will be released Nov. 30, I can’t guarantee I’ll have it for the holidays.”\n\nBooksellers advise customers to pre-order books due to be released in November or December and to shop early. And if the book they want is impossible to get, to be flexible and consider an alternate purchase.\n\nTo help you consider the books you might want for gifts this year, we’ve prepared a list of new and most anticipated titles in fiction, nonfiction and children’s books. Those listed without a release date have already been published and, with luck, are in stores.\n\nnegilson@gmail.com\n\n\n\nFICTION\n\n• “Apples Never Fall” by Liane Moriarty: The bestselling author’s new novel concerns the Delaney family whose members adore and sometimes detest one another.\n\n• “Cloud Cuckoo Land” by Anthony Doerr: The universally-praised new novel about the power of storytelling across centuries is by the author of “All the Light We Cannot See.”\n\n• “The Dark Hours” by Michael Connelly: The new Harry Bosch mystery/thriller costars LAPD Detective Renee Ballard.

I can’t believe how many whale-themed attractions you have in downtown New Bedford. And in honor of National Whale Day, on Feb. 21, I thought it would be fun to spend the afternoon visiting a few whale places. So, let’s dive right in!\n\nBut first a coffee\n\nBefore seizing the whale by its blowhole, my mom and I decided to visit Auntie Kath’s Bakery on Union Street. Last week, I wrote a story about this local bakery and wanted to stop in for some coffee. I am pleased to report that business has been booming, according to owner Kathleen Keeley.\n\n“Everyone keeps coming in saying they read the article,” Keeley said with a laugh. “It’s been non-stop.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhen I last interviewed Keeley, it was just her and her daughter behind the counter. Now, Keeley is training her first staff member. I even snapped a photo of her famous “mixer in the window” that she still invites any locals to come observe her make dough with at 5:15 a.m. If you haven’t been in to try her baked goods, head on over now.\n\nBy the way, during the last three SouthCoast adventures my mother and I were lucky to explore New Bedford on beautifully sunny winter days. This was the first time we journeyed in torrential downpour. And. We. Got. Wet.\n\nSeamen’s Bethel\n\nThe next stop was the Seamen’s Bethel. Unfortunately, the chapel was closed but we did walk the grounds. On Johnny Cake Hill, the chapel was built by the New Bedford Port Society in 1832. The National Historic Landmark was constructed for the sailors who called New Bedford their home and was a tradition to visit before setting sail.\n\nIt’s the same chapel referred to as the “Whaleman’s Chapel” in Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick.” And yes, it does have a bow-shaped pulpit (although I couldn’t confirm this with my own eyes). Inside attractions include the names of New Bedford whalers (and fisherman) killed, inscribed on the wall of the Bethel and the pew Melville sat in when he visited in 1840. The exteriors were featured in the 1956, John Huston movie adaptation of “Moby-Dick.”\n\nJohnny Cake Hill\n\nWe walked around the area and saw the Moby Dick Brewing Co., although we didn’t go inside. Through the window it looked like a fun place to enjoy some classic brews. The menu looks tasty, featuring seafood and other traditional New England delicacies.\n\nFurther down the road we saw the Waterfront Historic Area LeaguE building, also known as WHALE. The organization’s mission is to foster historic preservation within the city’s architectural heritage while enhancing the community.\n\nNew Bedford Whaling Museum\n\nWe made it back up toward the Whaling Museum. Of course, I had to go to the Whaling Museum for my whale column! And I have actually never been. I did have a friend get married there, but I was not in attendance. However, my parents did and my mom was very excited to return to explore.\n\nI was not prepared for this. I didn’t realize this museum was so large and action-packed. We arrived just as it opened, and there were a half a dozen people already exploring.\n\nIt felt very COVID safe\n\nMy mother is very nervous about COVID-19 and barely visits any indoor public places unless she needs to. She stayed in the museum for over an hour and felt safe. The museum does a great job with managing foot traffic. Its one-way designed pathway makes you feel safe and socially distanced from other guests as you walk through the 22 galleries. Almost every exhibit is wide open and incredibly clean.\n\n“There is a timed admission structure to keep us below capacity levels, which allows plenty of room for social distancing. Although we installed a UV air purification system, masks are mandatory,” says President and CEO Amanda McMullen in a press release. “For those who have grown comfortable with virtual exploration, we’ll continue our special programming online as well.\n\n“The New Bedford Whaling Museum ignites learning through the exploration of art, science, history, and culture, which is why we are happy to be safely welcoming visitors through our doors,” said McMullen.\n\nMeet Kobo and his fellow whales\n\nThere’s so much to do here. You can access free audio tours on your phone. There are also two new exhibits, A City for the Arts: Masterworks of Greater New Bedford and Ripples: Through a Wampanoag Lens worth checking out. I was allowed to walk onto the giant whaling ship. But the attraction that was intriguing to me was the oozing whale skeleton.\n\nApparently, for the last two decades, this whale skeleton has been slowing dripping oil onto the museum floor. I was fascinated by this strange phenomenon. One of the tour guides told us that his name was KOBO, a giant blue whale.\n\nThe 66-foot long, one-and-a-half ton skeleton is leaking oil because its carcass was left too long in the water. It was feasted on by fish that began devouring its bones. Thus, the museum funnels the whale oil into a small beaker. And the tour guide said the oil will continue to slowly drip until at least 2060. What???\n\nHow Kobo got this name: Call him Kobo\n\nMy mom and I then got lost… in the museum… which I was told by a New Bedford local is “not the first time.” We made the mistake of taking the third-floor stairwell, instead of the elevator, which forced us all the way down onto the street. But we did get to admire two more whale statues, including the giant whale tail at the corner of William and North Water streets.\n\nMoby Dick statue\n\nWe made it back to the museum, explored the gift shop, and decided to head out to the Moby Dick statue. Located on MacArthur Drive, near the Cuttyhunk Ferry Pier, the large white sculpture resembles Ahab’s infamous nemesis. In 2015, artists were asked to submit a “unique interpretation of a connection with the past, present and future of New Bedford.” Donna Dodson’s concept was selected.\n\n“In celebration of Herman Melville’s novel, Moby-Dick, I wanted to create a sculpture of the novel’s hero. Melville was a brilliant writer. He created the Captain of the ship who sought revenge on the whale who had harmed him, not from malice, but from some animal instinct. I created an anthropomorphic sculpture in celebration of Melville’s humanistic whale,” Dodson said on the Destination New Bedford web page.\n\nThe whales keep on coming\n\nWe moved on from the Moby Dick statue to explore more whale attractions, stopping to admire the giant whales painted on the outside wall of a warehouse on Route 18. Known as a “Whaling Wall,” it was painted in 2005 by Robert Wyland. It was #93 in a series of 100 whaling walls painted over three decades. Wyland began the series on a parking garage wall in 1981 and finished his 100th wall at the 2008 Olympic Games in China as a lead-in for the Beijing International Stadium.\n\nFrom there, we passed other whale spots such as the Whaling City Diner, Whaling City Expeditions, the Whale’s Tooth Parking Lot and the Whaling City Motors… wow New Bedford, you really love your whales. We traveled on until we “washed up” at the Whaling City Golf Course. That’s when my mother was starting to get a little “whaled-out.” So, we decided to head to one last whale spot.\n\nThe Black Whale\n\nThe Black Whale restaurant was created by locals to honor the seafaring heritage of New Bedford and the world-famous seafood bounty landed in its port, according to the website. Steve Silverstein, the owner, comes from New Bedford and grew up working as a scalloper. His mission is to serve fresh and innovative food and celebrate the New Bedford fisherman culture.\n\nStill nervous about COVID-19 safety, we ended up taking it to-go. Although, if the weather was nicer the outdoor deck looked safe and inviting.\n\nI had to try what they call their “award winning” New England clam chowder. I’ve had a lot of different clam chowders over the years, and this one was impressive. I enjoyed the flavorful chunks of clam and perfectly tender potatoes.\n\nMy mother enjoyed the veggie burger — made with quinoa, sweet potato, black beans, mushrooms and topped with avocado and pickled carrots. She said it was tasty and full of flavor and cooked perfectly. We split her fries.\n\nBoy, did we have a fun whaling adventure. The only thing missing was seeing an actual whale. We headed home to change out of our wet clothes and reminisce about yet another amusing adventure on the SouthCoast.\n\nI’m so proud that New Bedford still embraces what literally put this city on the map. You’re the Whaling City and you aren’t afraid to make that known. I can’t wait to join you all at the Whaling City Festival this year. I can feel the city’s “whale pride” and I’m so glad to be part of it with my job at The Standard-Times (which, by the way, sports a proud whale above the paper’s logo).\n\nHappy Whale Day!\n\nI'm the Newbie in New Bedford....and I want to see it all!

If you have any pop-culture Qs, send 'em my way at popcandy@usatoday.com or Twitter (hashtag: #CandyMailbag).\n\nLet's get started:\n\nYou can only have one medium for the rest of your life: comics, movies, novels or TV shows. What's your pick and why? — @SaltCityFanboy\n\nWhat an excruciating question! Right off the bat, I can tell you it's a choice between movies and novels. I love comics, but could exist without them (though it would be such a bleak world). And TV is such a time-sucker I generally feel angry with myself after binging on several hours of it.\n\nBut wow, I truly can't imagine living without being able to read a good book. That might have to be my choice, unless you're saying I could still read non-fiction ... in which case I'll pick movies! (I'd like to throw that same Q out to the rest of you, by the way. I've never really thought about it.)\n\nBetter movie: Valley Girl or Some Kind of Wonderful? — @YourBishop\n\nI have to put myself in the Wonderful camp. I feel like it's such an underrated John Hughes movie (though he didn't direct it), and the performances by Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson are so, so good. It's also pretty quotable, as are all Hughes films: Don't go mistaking paradise for a pair of long legs!\n\nWhen is the long-awaited follow-up to your first book? I'd love to read another book by the one and only Ms. W! — @BIGBUSINESS\n\nThat's very kind of you. I actually have (what I think is) a good book idea that I'm just starting to try to take to the next level. If you're an agent, gimme a shout!\n\nThe O.C. premiered 10 years ago this week! What are some of your favorite moments? Or rather, if Twitter had been around back then, what would have been your O.C. hashtags? — Gabriel W. in Columbus, Ohio\n\nYou know, back when The O.C. was on the air I had the irritating task of writing this weekly feature called \"The Annotated O.C.,\" in which I listed and defined every pop-culture reference on the show. (I can only blame myself, since I came up with the idea.) Anyway, as the series went on I dreamed of the day when it would be canceled so I could stop writing those pieces.\n\nLike most people, I preferred the show during the Marissa Cooper era. I never liked her, but killing her off was the wrong decision. Of course the Chrismukkah eps were pretty great, and I remember the Rooney ep being a classic. (Whatever happened to those guys?) I also dug Samaire Armstrong's character, since you don't often see comics-loving girls on TV, and I absolutely hatedOlivia Wilde's character. I never would've guessed Wilde would go on to have a bigger career than pretty much anyone else on the show!\n\nLately I've been listening to more podcasts, such as NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me and Alec Baldwin's Here's the Thing. I'm trying to find a pop culture podcast that basically embodies Pop Candy. Could you give me some suggestions? — Kristen Acosta\n\nWell, there's only one Pop Candy, but I'm happy to suggest a few more for ya: First off, you know I love Jeff Garlin's podcast, By the Way. He records long interviews with many people you read about on Pop Candy, like Zach Galifianakis, Henry Rollins and Amy Poehler. Throwing Shade is very funny and addresses a lot of women- and gay-themed news in pop culture; that's also a video podcast now.\n\nMy favorite Kevin Smith podcast is Hollywood Babble-On, in which Smith and co-host Ralph Garman chat about the week in pop culture. Kurt Andersen's Studio 360 always has at least one story I absolutely must hear. You may also love How Was Your Week?, in which Julie Klausner interviews folks and delivers the best \"podcast monologue\" out there, if there is such a thing. Let me know which one you like best!\n\nSince becoming a parent, what is the biggest \"new thing\" you've learned that you otherwise wouldn't know? (Having a 6-year-old daughter, I know way too much about Ponies and Monster High.) — Mark L.\n\nSince my daughter is only 10 months old, we haven't really delved into the world of characters yet (and she doesn't watch TV). However, I didn't really know about Maisy before I had a kid; these books have really saved the day on multiple occasions! There's also this author named Sandra Boynton, whose books are like crack for babies. And I'm now very familiar with every iteration of Eric Carle's Brown Bear (like Baby Bear, Polar Bear, Panda Bear, etc.). At this point I can probably recite 30 children's books by heart.\n\nWhenever I'm watching a cooking show such as Top Chef and the contestants go someplace where they have to cook for a bunch of people, I always wonder how those people got invited. Do you know how/where to find out when those food show tapings take place? — J.R. in Valencia, Calif.\n\nFor Top Chef, you'd probably have to live where the show was taping. (The next one is in New Orleans, so you're outta luck.) With other shows, I think it helps to have a connection to the media, food industry or cast/crew. For instance, I've been invited to Kitchen Nightmares a couple times, because of course they want some press. However, I think if you're going to be on a food show, that's probably the wrong one to pick!\n\nThis Chowhound thread has more helpful info about food-related TV tapings.\n\nThe other day you mentioned that Alan Alda and Henry Winkler were some of your best and nicest interviews. What made them so nice? What other interviews did you enjoy? — Anupama W.\n\nYes, some interviews stand out because the subject is either incredibly kind and well-spoken or egotistical and irritating. I remember Alan Alda and Henry Winkler just being so patient and gracious — and these are two actors who have been interviewed thousands of times and get the same questions over and over. When you're interviewing very famous people, the biggest issue is TIME. You often have a very limited amount, and if you go over, a publicist might come on the line and tell you to wrap it up. This didn't happen with Alda or Winkler.\n\nI could go on forever about interviews I loved, but another that stands out is Cameron Crowe. At the time, he was very busy promoting a movie, and at first I think whoever saw my request rejected it. He happened to see it, recognized my name and told that person to make it happen. Again, no time limit, and he asked me as many questions as I did of him. (That's a journalist for you.)\n\nI've also had very positive encounters with Patti Smith. I was pretty young the first time I saw her and, again, a publicist/manager tried to shoo me away when I approached her with a notebook and pen. Patti shot them down and said, \"No, let her talk.\"\n\nI get so many great book recommendations from you blog. I love hearing about what people are reading and always get excited when you list books in your Friday \"best of\" roundups. What are some novels that you've read recently that you maybe didn't mention on the blog? — Adele M.\n\nI really do try to share most of the books I read on the blog, but I can tell you that right now I'm immersed in Rob Sheffield's latest memoir, Turn Around Bright Eyes. I've been a fan of his for a long time, and I think one mark of a great writer is when he/she not only compels me to turn the page but inspires me to write more myself.\n\nI'm a Harmony Korine fan and enjoyed Spring Breakers. Can you make a top five of Harmony's work that you personally enjoyed? — BIG BUSINESS\n\nWasn't Spring Breakers great? It's definitely his most coherent work to date, although I admit some of his craziest, nonlinear stuff is my favorite. Ranking them is too hard, but I will say I liked Julien Donkey-Boy for the sheer weirdness of seeing someone wrestle a chair. I'm also unashamed to say I liked Trash Humpers. I think the Southern part of me really connects with Korine's affinity for the outsider and the absurd.\n\nOn that bizarre note, it's time to seal up the Mailbag!

She died shortly before he and his sister traveled to Florida to spend a day on the set of the film, set to be released on Jan. 12.\n\nYet at the same time, Roskos was giddy to see the quirky characters he'd created and the important themes his novel explores take three-dimensional shape, with the help of an empathetic producer, sensitive director and major Hollywood stars.\n\nThat overlay of sadness on top of whimsy and wonder is woven into the DNA of \"Dr. Bird's Advice for Sad Poets,'' on screen and printed page.\n\nThe 2013 book (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) is a semi-autobiographical work that explores the world of a 16-year-old boy living with social anxiety, panic attacks and depression. James' older sister has left both the family home and high school, and her abrupt departure sparks a quixotic quest in James to try to bring her back.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAs the protagonist, James turns to an imaginary giant pigeon therapist, a well-worn copy of Walt Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass,'' and a series of ordinary suburban trees (he likes to hug them) for comfort and ballast.\n\nRoskos, 42, lives in Collingswood with his wife Laura and 10-year-old son Dean. He began the book in 2010 in a collaboration with friend/fellow author Matthew Quick (\"The Silver Linings Playbook’’) at Grooveground, a downtown coffee shop. When Quick got interrupted by other work, he encouraged Roskos to write the book himself.\n\nThe road from publishing that novel to celebrating the film's release is a long one, made even longer due to the coronavirus pandemic. And that great disruption in the universe also means Roskos will celebrate its release on multiple streaming services next week — not at a fancy premiere but at home with his family on the couch.\n\nRoskos is not bitter — or even disillusioned. He may not be ready to let loose a barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world like Walt Whitman (who, by way, is buried not all that far from Rosko’s living room), but he’s pleased to see a dream come true, even if it doesn’t look exactly the way he envisioned it.\n\n“The film option came up pretty quickly,’’ he recalls. “And that’s not usually how these things work.’’\n\nJust months after publication, “Dr. Bird’’ was garnering good reviews, sales were solid and there was literary awards buzz, he remembers. And then an offer for a film option came from a small indie film company, Kreate Films.\n\n“You get really excited,’’ Roskos says of the process of moving from printed page to the big screen, “and then you wait around.’’\n\n'They were not alone out there'\n\nProducer Shona Tuckman had heard about the book from a friend on Good Reads, and was impressed by its sensitive portrayal of topics that she wasn’t seeing in literature for young people – serious, complicated issues like self harm, suicide ideation and panic attacks.\n\n“Having suffered from anxiety as a teenager myself, the book really resonated with me and I felt compelled to make it into a film,’’ Tuckman writes in an email. “There were no young adult novels written about mental health in the early ‘90s. I wanted to bring Evan’s story to the screen to allow today’s teenagers to not feel like they were alone out there, as I had felt.\n\n“Mental illness has to be a part of the conversation, it just has to be,’’ she continues. “I think with the pandemic hitting us all in the way that it has, people are starting to talk about mental health in a new way and that’s a good thing.’’\n\n“Shona was the right person for this book,’’ Roskos says. “She understood the idea of secrets and siblings and that whole relationship. She was in it for the content, not just for the opportunity to find a YA book to turn into a movie real quick.’’\n\nA short version of the film was made to screen for investors, which took about two years, which for Roskos meant “more waiting and hoping’’ as Tuckman worked to raise the funds to make the full-length movie.\n\n“You get to the point where you don’t want to hope and wait,’’ Roskos says, “and then you sound very ungrateful … and then you get a phone call that 17 things are happening right now!’’\n\nDirector Yani Raz signed onto the project early on and wrote the screenplay.\n\n“We had a long and wonderful conversation, and he also got it, right from beginning,’’ Roskos remembers.\n\nThe film was completed in 2018, and for Roskos “it’s a blur.’’\n\n“My mother passed away. A week later my sister and I flew down to go on set … It was kind of a hell of year… I am sure there is a story there. But basically, things got moving very quickly. They had been planning for so long and then they were trying to film a movie in 30 days. They were going from scene to scene fluidly.’’\n\nRoskos says that on set, he was impressed and star struck.\n\n“It was wild. I mean, here they are, making this movie out of something I wrote! It was a very calm set, and they clearly had a great sense of the material as they were working with it for so long. … I knew film was in really good hands.’’\n\nThe cast of the film includes Lucas Jade Zumann (“Anne with an E,’’ “20th Century Women’’) as James and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfroy in \"Harry Potter'' films) and Lisa Edelstein (\"House,'' \"Kominsky Method'') as his mother, as well as Taylor Russell, Tom Wilkinson, Odiseas Kwame Georgiadis, David Arquette and Chase Stokes.\n\nRoskos was particularly pleased by the casting of Zumann, whom he calls “kind and delightful.’’\n\nEdelstein stepped in to replace another actress at the last minute, and Roskos was able to watch her shoot several scenes – and had the opportunity to draw upon his day job as a kennel master at Rothman Animal Hospital to amuse the actress' dog while she was on camera.\n\nThe cast was shooting final scenes of the film that day, and Roskos recalls how powerful it was to watch Zumann and Edelstein share a very private, confessional scene.\n\n”I walked away from the production so confident,’’ he recalls. “I felt like we were watching the movie, not the filming of the movie. And that was a pretty big deal for us to be able to see Lisa and Lucas going through those scenes together.’’\n\nGetting out of James' head\n\nHowever thoughtfully Raz and Tuckman worked to bring the book to life, a screenplay is not a novel.\n\nAnd despite how personal “Dr. Bird’’ the book is to Roskos, he says he was prepared for the film to be different.\n\n“As a writer, emotionally, because of how long it took to be made, it was a lot easier for me to accept the changes. And it wasn’t that they didn’t understand the book. They understood the key things that needed to be in the story for it to work for me as the writer. And I knew Hollywood is going to change what they change and I didn’t have any control of over that.’’\n\nThe first half of the film follows the book pretty closely. In what seems a nod to the \"Harry Potter'' franchise, Walt Whitman counsels James from a framed portrait on his bedroom wall, and his poems become James' morning affirmations. Meanwhile Dr. Bird gently nudges the boy to recognize his own worth.\n\nBut “Dr. Bird’’ the book takes place entirely inside James’ head, in the manner of \"The Wonder Years'' and narrator Kevin, but Roskos realized “there would need to be some externalization. Now, ‘Taxi Driver,’ that’s a film that takes place entirely in one guy’s head, but you can’t always get away with that.’’\n\nAnd so the film mines new territory, involving an extended adventure James embarks upon with his love interest, Sophie, which may or may not involve everything from paintball and honey making to high school parties and gently fumbling sexual encounters to cosplay, nightclubs and even a cult.\n\n“There are some things that ratchet up the stakes as they go,’’ he says, “but I don’t want to ruin it for anybody.’’\n\nJames' parents also have much more material to work with on screen, more fully realized as a couple that has grown to blame their regrets squarely upon each other, while arguing about the family restaurant (\"No one really trusts a Caucasian sushi chef!'').\n\nWhat remains intact is the sensitive treatment of mental health issues among young people, something that was nonnegotiable for Roskos.\n\nHe feels the book was well received by teens because it wasn’t afraid to examine complex issues like anxiety and depression without trying to solve them. When James accepts help – from friends, from an actual therapist – it signals to young people that it’s OK to need support.\n\n“I did actually have a couple of instances where teachers were using it in the classroom,’’ says Roskos, who has taught at both Rowan and Rutgers universities. “It’s a tough book to pin down. It’s kind of dark even though I tried to make it lighthearted and … it’s funny but it is sort of intense.’’\n\nHe recalls an eighth-grade teacher reading it with her students as a means of opening up conversations, not just about their own struggles but how to support friends and peers should they be grappling with mental health issues.\n\n“That was a really positive experience,\" he says, \"with the teacher providing information for them on where they could go for help … such as self-harm hotlines or eating disorder organizations.’’\n\nA means of connection\n\nWhile he savors the satisfaction of finally seeing his name in the credits of a Hollywood film, Roskos has also moved well past it. He isn’t currently teaching, opting out of the challenges of virtual classrooms to spend time branching out into more adult books.\n\n“I haven’t given up writing for dogs,’’ he promises, referring to the kennel job and a dog walking side hustle that help pay the bills.\n\nAnd he wonders how young people are coping with the isolation that the pandemic has brought to all of us.\n\n“I look at my own son and he’s 10 and … the only way he’s been able to connect with friends right now is through online video games, which has been a welcome, somewhat healthy way to stay in touch with other kids.\n\n“And I do see a concern for him just personally, like how long is this going to go on and how is he going to come out on the other side? Kids and teenagers who are prone to isolation and anxiety are struggling even more. It’s hard to say this, but this is how the world is right now and you’ve got to get through it. And it’s not an easy answer, just an explanation. Even adults are dealing with the constraints of the lockdown.’’\n\nYet, much like James finds his moments of Whitman-like abandon, Roskos sees some “yawp-worthy’’ moments when people find creative ways to break through the isolation and connect.\n\n“That’s why so many TV and movies are resonating with us all right now. You do your best with what you’ve got, and it gives us something to connect over, to talk about.’’\n\nAnd soon, that will include talking about “Dr. Bird.’’\n\nThe producer Roskos trusted with his story is ready to celebrate right along with him, even if it’s from her own couch.\n\n“I’m excited for the film to be released after many years putting it together,’’ says Tuckman, “and I hope it touches people in the way I intended. Even if we are able to reach one person and they are able to get help, then we will have done our job.’’\n\nTammy Paolino is Features Editor for the Atlantic South region of the USA Today Network.

It’s a short gestation by Rossian standards — his novel, the much-lauded \"Mr. Peanut,\" was 13 years in the making. But the result is still a monumental makeover.\n\nThe changes begin with the shock of art on the front of a magazine that has never printed anything other than text, and they continue throughout the volume. Women’s voices abound. There are writers of color, including one whose narrator uses the N-word three times in his first two sentences. There are unknown writers appearing next to lesser-knowns next to hotshots and stars. And there is perhaps enough transgression to satisfy the spirit of Tennessee Williams, whose bequest to the University of the South supports the Review’s publication.\n\nRoss has, in short, imposed modernity on the nation’s oldest continuously published literary quarterly. In conversation, he seems duly awed by the legacy, where so many literary greats — Flannery O’Connor, Cormac McCarthy, T.S. Eliot, Robert Penn Warren, Saul Bellow, Sylvia Plath, and Eudora Welty — have been published. Prior to the launch of Sewanee Review’s redesign on Tuesday, Ross answered questions from Chapter 16 via email.\n\nChapter 16: George Core, your predecessor, started as Sewanee Review editor during the Nixon years, about the time you entered grade school.\n\nAdam Ross: The length of Mr. Core’s tenure makes him an outlier so far as the magazine’s history goes. Most Review editors last about a decade. On the other hand, it’s such a fantastic job I could see myself doing this until retirement, whenever that is.\n\nChapter 16: “Venerable” is a commonly used adjective for The Sewanee Review. Are there less flattering descriptions that hold at least a kernel of truth?\n\nRoss: “Irrelevant.” Too few people read the Review. There’s a reason for that. I think the quarterly drifted from participating in the broader literary conversation. That’s neither a dig on its quality nor a criticism of the conversation it was having — great writers in every genre and discipline have always filled its pages. George Core published poets like Christian Wiman, Seamus Heaney, Wendell Berry, and Howard Nemerov. But the magazine’s bandwidth got a little narrow, I think.\n\nChapter 16: Did you ever try to get published in The Sewanee Review?\n\nRoss: I submitted something in the early ‘90s, just out of grad school, and got a form-letter rejection. I was furious and vowed I’d one day take over as the editor. All has gone according to plan.\n\nChapter 16: Can you give me a taste of your first issue?\n\nRoss: One of my favorite pieces is poet Mary Jo Salter’s essay on the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mark Strand. It’s about how great artists corner a certain niche of existence and make it uniquely their own — how painter Edward Hopper Hopperizes the world, for instance, or Mark Strand Strands you.\n\nChapter 16: How do you see yourself pivoting from fiction writer to editor?\n\nRoss: Just as there are actors’ directors, there are writers’ editors. William Maxwell wore both hats. Toni Morrison was an editor at Random House. Jonathan Galassi at FSG comes to mind. Because I’ve written fiction and nonfiction, I intimately understand the struggle writers face. They want dialogue. They appreciate it when you see their work from the inside out, especially at the draft stage, which is what I’m trying to do — understand their intention when they might not yet completely — before the process of burnishing it on a line-by-line basis begins.\n\nChapter 16: Who have SR’s readers been? Do you see that changing?\n\nRoss: New voices will predominate — all but one of our first issue’s writers are enjoying their Sewanee Review debut. And I’m proud to say that this is the first issue in the quarterly’s history in which more than half its writers are women. It wasn’t even close before.\n\nChapter 16: SR’s editors, since its founding in 1892, have all been white men. Talk about diversity and what the lack of it portends.\n\nRoss: I’d shift the question’s emphasis. If its implication is that white men will only publish white men, well, I disagree. Lorin Stein, The Paris Review’s editor, doesn’t struggle to publish a magazine that reflects America’s diverse landscape. Nor does the The New Yorker’s David Remnick or The Kenyon Review’s David Lynn. John Freeman’s biannual journal Freeman’s, is amazing. Look, diversity for the sake of diversity isn’t an editorial vision. However, a view toward excellence can lead to diversity, so long as you cast a wide net, and I’m committed to that.\n\nChapter 16: What must endure about The Sewanee Review?\n\nRoss: It has always been committed to excellent writing. We have to remain fearless and exacting about that. That’s why its reputation is deserved. You don’t continuously publish since 1892 by being average.\n\nChapter 16: I’m currently trying to read a novel by a famous contemporary author and find myself thinking, “No one would publish or read this, if not for the author’s fame.” Ever have that experience?\n\nRoss: Of course. I’ll add that this novelist and short-story writer is very aware of how hard it is to write a decent book, let alone a really good one. Great books are rarer than anyone likes to admit.\n\nChapter 16: What’s the status of your own novel-in-progress, \"Playworld\"? What are your future plans besides being SR’s editor?\n\nRoss: My future plans are to finish my novel. I’m close to halfway through, I like what I have, and I’d love to be done sooner, but, man, I’ve been busy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/28"}]}

For the latest updates on Donald Trump's election victory and remaining House races, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Thursday, Nov. 7.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris conceded her defeat in an address supporters Wednesday afternoon at Howard University, her alma mater in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"When we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris told the crowd, drawing an implicit contrast to former President Donald Trump, who refused to commit to accepting the election's outcome.\n\nHarris called Trump earlier on Wednesday, conceding the historic election after a hard-fought race for the right to lead the nation. She discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans with Trump, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\nFoes of Trump, meanwhile, promised to provide his administration no honeymoon. Hours after Trump's victory, advocacy groups were setting their sights on the president-elect, who will take office Jan. 20.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many controversial Trump policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a battle plan and would take action \"the minute he takes the oath of office.\"\n\nKris Brown, president of the gun-safety group Brady, called Trump's election \"troubling\" but pledged to continue the fight to prevent gun violence: \"Even though we won’t have a friend in the White House, Brady isn’t giving up an inch.\"\n\nSierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous called Trump's first term a \"disaster for climate progress\" and pledged to \"challenge Trump’s dangerous proposals in court (and) keep the pressure on banks and big corporations to clean up their act.\"\n\nThose advocacy groups will be facing a president whose party could emerge with majorities in the the House and Senate. GOP candidates picked up several pivotal Senate seats, including in West Virginia and Ohio, to seize control of the Senate. Results were still coming in for dozens of tightly contested House seats, but Speaker Mike Johnson issued a statement saying the \"latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority.\"\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the presidential election and downballot fights.\n\nBiden congratulates Trump, invites him to White House\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and invited him to a meeting at the White House during the presidential transition period – an invitation which Trump did not extend to him just four years ago.\n\nBiden’s outreach to Trump isn’t necessarily unusual – outgoing presidents traditionally meet with their successors before the formal inauguration. But it comes after Trump refused to extend a similar invitation to Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Trump also promoted fraudulent claims that the election was stolen and skipped Biden’s inauguration.\n\n“President Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together,\" the White House said in a statement about the phone call.\n\nTrump Campaign Spokesperson Steven Cheung confirmed the call, saying in a statement that “President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.”\n\nThe White House has yet to be set a date for Trump and Biden’s encounter. Biden plans to address the country on Thursday to discuss the presidential transition efforts.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nWASHINGTON − Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he spoke with President-elect Donald Trump and congratulated him on his decisive election win as the Ukrainian leader seeks continued U.S. support for his country's war against Russia.\n\nZelenskyy, in a post on X, said he had an \"excellent call\" with Trump and \"congratulated him on his historic landslide victory,\" adding that \"his tremendous campaign made this result possible.\"\n\n\"I praised his family and team for their great work,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has pumped billions of dollars in military support into Ukraine two and a half years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of the neighboring country. But future U.S. aid for Ukraine is in doubt after the election of Trump, who has a history of flattering statements about Putin and would not say during a September presidential debate whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'We all pray for America's success'\n\nFormer House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging Trump's victory and committing to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"We all pray for America's success under the next Administration,\" she said. \"The peaceful transfer of power is the cornerstone of our democracy. After every election, we all have a responsibility to come together and find common ground.\"\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nBernie Sanders blames Democrats for their losses\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blasted the Democratic Party for its presidential and Senate election losses on Tuesday night, arguing that it had moved away from its roots supporting America’s middle and lower class.\n\n“It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” said Sanders, the most prominent progressive lawmaker in Congress. He mentioned concerns about access to healthcare, automation eliminating blue-collar jobs and the war in Israel.\n\nThe strong rebuke comes after Sanders endorsed President Joe Biden, and then Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s nominee earlier this year. When Harris unveiled her economic plan earlier this year, Sanders said he was “impressed,” and called it “an excellent start.”\n\nSanders did not mention either Harris or Biden in his statement, instead targeting it at the party’s infrastructure.\n\n“Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?” Sanders questioned. “Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris: 'When we lose an election, we accept the results'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday conceded the 2024 election, promising a peaceful transfer of power.\n\n“The outcome is not what we hoped for, worked for or voted for, but the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting,” Harris said during a concession speech at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C. \"The fight for our country is always worth it.\"\n\n\"I am so proud of the campaign we ran,\" Harris told the crowd, to enthusiastic applause.\n\nHarris called on young people to continue to fight to make the “world a better place” while vowing to continue her fight for the freedoms she laid out during her campaign, including abortion rights and gun control.\n\n“While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “We will continue to wage this fight in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square, and we will also wage it in quieter ways, in how we live our lives, by treating one another with kindness and respect.\"\n\n\"Do not despair,\" she added. \"This is a time to mobilize.\"\n\nWhen Harris said the country may be entering a dark period, a smattering of attendees responded, \"We are.\"\n\nTrump was announced the winner of the 2024 presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sweeping many of the key swing states and widening his support among young men, Black men and Hispanic voters to prevail.\n\nAs attendees filtered out, younger Harris supporters and staffers shed tears as her time as a candidate came to a close.\n\n— Rebecca Morin and Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden invited Trump to White House in phone call\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Trump earlier in the day to congratulate the former president on his victory in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nHe also invited Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future, the White House said.\n\nIn a stunning political comeback, the former president won all seven battleground states on the road to 270 electoral votes, capturing a decisive victory against Harris.\n\nThe vice president will be delivering remarks at Howard University at 4 p.m., the White House said. Harris also called Trump to congratulate him, according to a senior Harris aide.\n\n-Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTop Harris adviser says VP faced ‘deep hole’ in race against Trump\n\nHarris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe called the vice president’s loss to Donald Trump “devastating\" and pointed to a “deep hole” Harris faced after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n“It was a privilege to spend the last 100 days with Kamala Harris,” Plouffe said in a post on X, commending the “amazing staff” led by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon “who left it on the field for their country.”\n\n“We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss. Thanks for being in the arena, all of you,” Plouffe said.\n\nPlouffe, who worked as President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008, was among a group of former Obama staffers tapped for top campaign leadership positions after Harris secured the Democratic nomination. Harris mounted a condensed 108-day campaign that ultimately fell well short of victory.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nGeorge W. Bush congratulates Trump\n\nFormer President George W. Bush congratulated Donald Trump and JD Vance on their win and thanked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their service to the country in a statement Wednesday morning.\n\n“The strong turnout in this election is a sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions,” Bush said. “We join our fellow citizens in praying for the success of our new leaders at all levels of government.\n\nThe former Republican president did not endorse either Trump or Harris in the election. His daughter, Barbara Bush, knocked doors for the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and his vice president, Dick Cheney, endorsed the Democratic candidate.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWho will serve in a second Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday’s election marked the end of a long, divisive campaign that will see the Republican return to the White House just four years after voters ejected him from the job.\n\nWith the campaign behind him, Trump can now turn his attention to putting together a cabinet and a staff to carry out his agenda.\n\nA familiar cast of characters – some of whom had jobs in his first administration – stand ready to serve. Others − like the many who officials from his first administration who subsequently questioned his fitness for office − not so much.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s in and who isn't.\n\n-Michael Collins\n\nWhat is Project 2025 that outlines extreme positions?\n\nThe controversial conservative playbook Project 2025, a highly criticized \"presidential transition project\" created by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, could draw intense interest when the Trump administration takes power in January. Harris attempted to tie the former president to the 900-page document that outlines extreme policy positions, such as limiting abortion access and mass deportation, that project supporters hope Trump will implement.\n\nTrump has repeatedly distanced himself from the project, claiming in a July Truth Social post to \"know nothing about Project 2025\" despite many of the project's creators having close ties to the previous Trump administration.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will Kamala Harris speak to supporters?\n\nHarris will address supporters at Howard University in Washington, tentatively at 4 p.m. ET, a source familiar with the plans confirmed. She is expected to formally concede the race.\n\nHarris had been set to publicly address her followers at an election night party at Howard, her alma mater, but the vice president stayed at her residence as her path to victory narrowed. Trump secured the 270 electoral votes needed to become the next president after he was projected the winner of Wisconsin around 5:40 a.m. ET.\n\nSpeaker Johnson: Border, inflation issues helped keep House in GOP hands\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the narrowly divided House appears set to remain in Republican control, which he credited to widespread support for secure borders and reducing inflation. The House will participate in a unified GOP government with the Senate and White House after victories in critical swing districts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Johnson said.\n\n“The latest data and trends indicate that when all the votes are tabulated, Republicans will have held our majority, even though we faced a map with 18 Biden-won seats,” Johnson said in a statement. “I look forward to working with President Trump and a Republican Senate to deliver as speaker of the House on the mandate entrusted to us by the American people.\"\n\nRFK Jr. says he wants to clear out FDA departments\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that he plans to clear out \"entire departments\" at the Food and Drug Administration if he has the capacity to do so in the next Trump administration.\n\n\"I can get the corruption out of the agencies,\" Kennedy said in an interview with MSNBC. \"That's what I've been doing for 40 years. I've sued all those agencies. I have a Ph.D. in corporate corruption.\"\n\nThe president-elect thanked Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign to endorse Trump, during his victory speech. Last week, Kennedy said Trump \"promised\" him control of U.S. health agencies, but a member of the Trump transition team refuted that.\n\n\"He's going to help make America healthy again,\" Trump said about Kennedy early Wednesday morning. \"He wants to do some things, and we're gonna let him go to it.\"\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos congratulates Trump\n\nJeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, congratulated president-elect Trump on his victory over Harris on Wednesday.\n\n“Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities” Bezos wrote in a post on X Wednesday morning. “Wishing @realDonaldTrump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love.”\n\nThe good wishes come a week after Bezos defended the Post’s decision not to issue an endorsement of either presidential candidate – a move that broke with decades of tradition and led to resignations of multiple members of the editorial board as well as the cancellation of over 200,000 digital subscriptions, NPR reported. The editorial board had intended to endorse Harris before Bezos made the decision to nix presidential endorsements, according to the Post.\n\nIn an opinion article, Bezos defended the move, arguing it would help restore public trust by ending a practice he says creates a “perception of non-independence” and bias.\n\n− Chris Cann\n\nMitch McConnell congratulates Trump, grateful filibuster is 'secure'\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Trump on his victory in the presidential race on Wednesday, telling reporters at the Capitol that he commended the former president for “running a sharper operation this time.”\n\nMcConnell, who’s been the minority leader of the Senate since 2021 and will be stepping down from his leadership role this month, also said that he “had really hoped I'd be able to hand over to my successor, the majority.”\n\n\"Based on the fact that we haven't got all the results, and we certainly already know we're going to be in the majority, we're hopeful that that might actually grow some,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of Republicans having Senate control, McConnell said, is that the filibuster “will stand.”\n\n“There won’t be any new states admitted to give a partisan advantage to the other side, and we’ll quit beating up the Supreme Court every time we don’t like a decision they make,” he said. So I think this shifting to a Republican Senate majority helps control the guardrails to keep people who want to change the rules in order to achieve something they think is worthwhile, not successful. And so I think the filibuster is very secure.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNetanyahu, Zelenskyy speak with Trump\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a \"warm and cordial\" conversation with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday and was among the first world leaders to speak with him after his election victory. Netanyahu said they spoke about Israel's security and \"the Iranian threat.\"\n\nTrump has long been close to Netanyahu and in his first term was widely viewed as one of the most pro-Israel U.S. presidents of modern times. Trump broke with years of U.S. policy when he moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Palestinians also claim as their future capital. It's not immediately clear how Trump will deal the war in Gaza.\n\nDozens of leaders and U.S. allies released statements expressing well wishes and congratulations after Trump won the election. Among them was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose country is trying to determine whether Trump's White House will cut back on U.S. military aid for Ukraine or nudge it toward a peace deal with Russia.\n\n\"I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.\"\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nHistoric comeback for Trump, a once and future president\n\nFour years ago, Trump by most measures was a political pariah. Now he’s a president in waiting. Rising from the ashes after a bonfire of scandal fueled by four criminal prosecutions, two impeachments and a failed insurrection, Trump swept aside dire warnings that he could bring American democracy to an end and instead used the democratic system as the ultimate vindication.\n\nNow he will become the second president in history − the first since Grover Cleveland more than century ago − to serve nonconsecutive terms.\n\nA politician rejected by voters in 2020 and abandoned by many in his party after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump is poised to again become the most powerful man in the world. The convicted felon is now the incoming commander in chief.\n\nWeeks of polling had showed the candidates competing in a razor-close election, but in the end Trump won over enough pivotal states with his focus on inflation and immigration. Harris won much of the West Coast and Northeast and Trump clinched victories in the South. But Trump also picked up North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, pushing him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the race. Read more here on how Trump's historic comeback happened.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nWhat happens with Donald Trump's criminal cases?\n\nThe election victory will delay and possibly wipe out Trump’s four pending criminal cases, according to legal experts. Trump has made clear he would derail the efforts of Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith in his two federal cases. And action in two state cases in New York and Georgia are likely to be postponed until he is done serving in the White House.\n\n“I think we are in uncharted territory,” said Alexander Reinert, a Cardozo School of Law professor, said of the state cases.\n\nTrump has said he could fire Smith or pardon himself. “It’s so easy − I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Oct. 24.\n\nWhat the election results mean for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis.\n\nACLU ready to challenge Trump’s `mass deportation’ plan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which fought many of Donald Trump’s controversial policies during his first administration, said Wednesday that it already has a plan for Trump’s next term. The ACLU was the first group in 2017 to challenge Trump’s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries, one of 434 legal actions it took against the first Trump administration.\n\nThis time, Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the ACLU is ready to fight Trump’s vow to seek retribution against his enemies, to launch a “mass deportation” of at least 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization and other promises.\n\n“We are ready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office,” Romero said in a statement. “When President-elect Trump targets immigrants, dissidents and his political opponents we will challenge him in the courts, in state legislatures and in the streets.”\n\nVance, mom all smiles after victory\n\nVice president-elect JD Vance thanked supporters after he and Trump claimed victory early Wednesday morning. And his mother, Beverly Aikins, returned to Facebook on Wednesday to celebrate her son's win. Aikins took a break from social media in July after seeing \"vitriol and hate\" toward her son, including from critics in Vance's hometown of Middletown, where she still lives.\n\n\"Too big to rig,\" she wrote. \"Popular vote by more than five million. Two hundred seventy seven electoral votes and still counting. Trump Vance 2024.\"\n\n− Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nBomb threats linked to Russia did not alter election, official says\n\nBomb threats believed to be emanating from Russia interrupted voting Tuesday across numerous battleground states, but a top U.S. cybersecurity official said they didn’t have a material impact on the election or voters’ ability to cast their ballots. Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a midnight press briefing that Tuesday's election did see some \"minor\" disruptive activities, including polling station evacuations and delays.\n\nEasterly and other officials said the hoax bomb threats were sent to at least four states and were all deemed to be \"non-credible.\"\n\n“The point is this did not impact the ability of voters to cast their ballots or for their votes to be counted as cast,” Easterly said, commending the election officials on the ground in the states. “Ultimately they were able to demonstrate extensive resilience based on their preparations for it. … Overall I would call this a good news story for democracy.”\n\nEight states vote to prohibit noncitizen voting\n\nEight states approved constitutional amendments or ballot initiatives Tuesday to prohibit noncitizens from voting, a key Republican priority even though state and federal laws already prohibit it and despite studies showing it almost never happens. All the states adopted the measures by 2-1 margins or better. The constitutional amendments typically approved a very simple change of phrasing about citizens voting to add “only” citizens may vote.\n\nNorth Carolina and Wisconsin were key swing states that each adopted constitutional amendments. Other states were Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.\n\n“It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in our elections,” Michael Whatley, co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, said when filing lawsuits against states to prevent noncitizen voting. “Yet time and again, we have seen Democrat officials oppose basic safeguards and dismantle election integrity provisions, intentionally opening the door to non-citizen voting in our elections.”\n\nStudies by the Brennan Center for Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have found noncitizen voting is essentially nonexistent. A Georgia audit of voter rolls this year found 20 noncitizens among 8.2 million registered voters.\n\nCenter for American Women and Politics: `Progress is not inevitable’\n\nHarris’ candidacy demonstrated much of the advantages women have when they run for office, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. She was a formidable fundraiser. She connected with voters on issues important to her and to them. Her identify gave her a unique perspective on overlooked issues, the research center said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the race also exemplified research that shows obstacles female candidates face, primarily unequal expectations. That’s particularly true for women of color, the center said. While women have held nearly every political office in America, they still hold fewer than a third of all political seats at every level of office – and still haven’t reached the highest office in the land.\n\n“Progress is not inevitable,” the center said. “We have made great strides, yes, but there are many steps left on the path to parity.”\n\nCan Trump run again in 2028?\n\nTrump has run for president three times, winning the office in 2016 and now in 2024. So, can he run again in 2028? The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits one person from serving more than two terms as president.\n\nAll presidents served no more than two terms until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected president four times from 1932 to 1944. In 1947, two years after Roosevelt's death, a push began in the House of Representative to limit presidents to two terms. After some revisions by the Senate, the proposed amendment was approved and sent out to states, It was rtified on Feb. 27, 1951.\n\n− Chad Murphy, Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nFrom pariah to president: From pariah to president: Donald Trump rises from the ashes to reclaim the White House\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost the election\n\nAn appearance on ABC's \"The View\" last month provided a friendly forum for Harris to introduce herself to Americans unfamiliar with her story. But Harris struggled to explain what she would do differently than President Joe Biden. “Not a thing that comes to mind,” the incumbent vice president told the hosts.\n\nFollowing Trump’s victory over Harris, that television moment underscored a fatal flaw of Harris’ campaign that doomed her election bid – an inability to separate herself from an unpopular president whose approval ratings have hovered around 40% for most of his four years in the White House.

He also notched victories in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe former president also picked up Republican strongholds across the country on Tuesday, from Texas to Montana and South Carolina. He won a few states that used to be swing states but have trended further to the right in recent years, including Ohio and Florida.\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid\n\nWhat states did Harris win on Election Day?\n\nHarris picked up Democratic strongholds across the country, from California to New York and Illinois.

Kamala Harris battled over taxes, the environment and the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus in a debate that gave Americans a more policy-focused and less fiery picture of where the two campaigns stand with weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election.\n\nThe 90-minute exchange, the only vice presidential debate of the 2020 cycle, became – as expected – a battle over President Donald Trump, who remained at the White House Wednesday fighting his own case of coronavirus even as he tries to reset a campaign that polling shows is losing ground in several battleground states.\n\nFrom its earliest moments, the discussion was far more civil than the widely panned debate last week between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Though both Pence and Harris came in hot at times and drew sharp contrasts on policies they had far more time to discuss issues.\n\n\"We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people,\" Pence argued during a discussion on the pandemic.\n\nHarris fired back: \"You respect the American people when you tell them the truth.\"\n\nThe two candidates sat 12 feet apart and were separated by plexiglass, inescapable evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has infected every aspect of American life – including the White House, where Pence has been forced to explain why he has not quarantined amid an outbreak of cases among Trump's top staff.\n\nThe sparse and socially distanced members of the audience all wore masks – and kept them on – after they were admonished not to take them off as Trump's supporters did in Cleveland last week.\n\nAs had been largely expected, Harris sought to keep the focus on the Trump administration’s perceived missteps, particularly on the high number of COVID-19 deaths. Pence, by contrast, ripped a page from the Trump playbook by arguing that Biden had been co-opted by the party’s left-wing – and that Harris was an embodiment of that movement.\n\nHarris accused Trump of calling those who serve in the military “suckers” and “losers,” terms in news reports that Trump has denied using. And she attacked the Trump administration for trying to abolish the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature health care law. In one particularly poignant moment in the debate, Pence pressed Harris on whether she would support adding justice to the Supreme Court, as some Democrats have called for. Harris did not answer the question directly.\n\nThere were several notable instances when neither candidate answered directly, such as on a question about whether they had spoken with their respective presidential candidates about how to handle a transfer of power in the event that they become incapacitated. That issue has raised the stakes of the vice presidential contest for some given that Trump is 74 and Biden is 77.\n\nAnalysts said Pence held his own during the debate – and even won a supportive tweet from the president for his performance. But with fewer than four weeks to go and millions of voters already cast, some analysts said Pence needed to hit a home run at the debate to help Trump in the face of worsening poll numbers.\n\nBoth candidates probably did what they had to do, several experts said, and like most vice presidential debates, it likely won’t change many voters’ minds.\n\n\"Sen. Harris turned in the best debate performance she has given all year. She wove together policy statistics, personal stories, and well-timed barbs -- all while continuing to smile and remind Pence when he interrupted her that she was speaking,” said Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University. “Still…Pence delivered his answers in a calm and authoritative manner. The bottom line is that both reassured their respective partisans of their political competency and policy chops.”\n\nAaron Kall, a debate coach at the University of Michigan, argued that Pence walked into the debate with lower expectations and appeared to clear that bar.\n\n“There was no major moment in the debate that will move the political needle or radically move independent voters in the race,” Kall said. “Pence's solid rebound performance may be able to provide some momentum to the campaign and energize President Trump ahead of his final two debate performances.\"\n\n— John Fritze, Ledyard King, David Jackson\n\nBiden-Harris campaign on Pence: ‘He didn’t just mansplain. He man-dodged.'\n\nIn a post-debate phone call with reporters, the Biden-Harris campaign said Pence dodged questions, acted disrespectfully to Harris and failed to outline a plan to combat the nation’s coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“Tonight you saw a contrast on stage,” said Liz Allen, communications director for Harris, adding that Harris outlined how a Biden-Harris administration “would get the coronavirus outbreak under control, expand access to quality and affordable health care and address the threat of climate change.”\n\n“What we saw from Mike Pence was more of the same lies and the same interruptions in a different city.”\n\nBiden senior advisor Symone Sanders said Harris made a “strong and clear case” for why the Biden-Harris ticket “will stand up for middle-class families, unite this country and win the battle for the soul of the nation.”\n\n“She made history tonight as the first Black woman to participate in a vice presidential debate. There was a lot of talk about how she would do. Let’s just say she passed with flying colors,” Sanders said, making a not-so-subtle reference to the fly that was spotted on Pence’s head for a portion of the debate.\n\n“Mike Pence used his time to evade, to lie, to attack and talk over Kamala Harris and Susan Page. He didn’t just mansplain. He man-dodged,” Sanders said.\n\nFormer South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a onetime Democratic presidential candidate who role-played Pence during Harris’ mock debates, said Pence was “not able to do what he needed to do tonight, which was to somehow change the dynamic of the race.”\n\n“The VP kept trying to create this picture that everything’s just going along just fine in America,” he said in a post-debate interview on MSNBC. “And she spoke right through that, explaining how the failures of this presidency have led us to where we are.”\n\nHe called it a “command performance” for Harris.\n\n“The only real surprise, I would say, was the disrespect that he showed for the moderator and for the rules,” Buttigieg said of Pence. “He’s generally somebody who tries to be very gentlemanly. I don’t know if that was a factor of being spooked about what’s going on with the polls. I don’t know if he was trying to impress his boss. You know often there’s an audience of one you have to think about when you’re part of the Trump machine.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nThe question mark over a 'peaceful transfer of power'\n\nIn one of the final questions of the night, moderator Susan Page asked both candidates how they would ensure a peaceful transfer of power if Biden and Harris should win in November. President Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nHarris pointed to the broad coalition she and Biden built, which includes Republicans including Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Sen. John McCain, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n\nHarris said the Biden campaign believes \"in the American people\" and \"in our democracy.\" She urged viewers to vote.\n\n\"We have within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years,\" she added.\n\nOn his responsibility, if Trump refuses a peaceful transfer of power, Pence insisted that he believes the Trump campaign would win re-election and accused Harris and Democrats of trying to overturn the 2016 election results.\n\n\"President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life,\" Pence said. \"And I have every confidence that this the same Americans that deliver that historic victory in 2016.\n\nThe question of whether Trump will concede a close election could become moot - Polls in the last week show the president trailing Biden by double digits.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nHarris dodges whether she supports expanding the Supreme Court\n\nPence tried to get Harris to answer a question that she and Biden have been dodging: Do they support expanding the Supreme Court as many liberals are advocating?\n\nPence said the public deserves to know, calling it a classic case if trying to change the rules if you can’t win by the rules.\n\nHarris preferred to talk about Republicans’ decision to move forward with filling the current Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\n\n“I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more,” she said. Harris went back to 1864, when she said Abraham Lincoln didn’t think it right to fill a vacancy 27 days before an election.\n\n“The American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime,” she said.\n\nPence noted that Harris hadn’t said whether she wants to expand the court.\n\n“If you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is, they are going to pack the Supreme Court,” he said.\n\nHarris said Trump has been stacking the bench with people “who are purely ideological.” Of the 50 people Trump appointed to the appeals court, none are Black, she charged.\n\nIf Pence wants to talk about packing the court, she said, “let’s have that discussion.”\n\n“I just want the record to reflect,” Pence said, “that she never answered the question.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nPence on Breonna Taylor: ‘I trust our justice system’\n\nPence and Harris disagreed whether “justice was served” in the case of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old woman in Louisville, Kentucky who was shot and killed by police officers during an attempted search for drugs and cash that went horribly wrong.\n\nNone of the three officers were charged with killing Taylor, an unarmed Black woman. One officer was charged of first-degree wanton endangerment.\n\n“I don’t believe so,” Harris said when asked whether justice was served, adding that she was heartbroken talking with Taylor’s mother and family. “Her family deserves justice. Her life was taken unjustifiably.”\n\nPence said, “Our heart breaks for any American innocent life.” He added: “But I trust our justice system – a grand jury that reviewed the evidence.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nThank you, already!\n\nIt will almost certainly be the phrase that will pop up the most in the transcript of the first vice presidential debate: “Thank you, Vice President Pence”\n\nThere were far fewer interruptions during the debate Wednesday compared with the presidential debate, but Pence embraced a more common debate tactic that has often been used by members of both parties: Running way overtime to get in that last sentence or one more barb.\n\n“Thank you, Vice President Pence,” moderator Susan Page of USA TODAY said over and over again to try to move the conversation on.\n\nPence even got a laugh line on the clock, according to reporters who were in the room with the two candidates. At one point, when Pence tried to ask for more time to respond to Harris, Page reluctantly said he could have 15 seconds.\n\n\"I've got to have more than that,\" Pence said, sending a ripple of laughter through the auditorium.\n\nThough the interruptions were less severe, they did happen. Another phrase that came up frequently was from Harris: “I’m speaking,” she repeatedly said to Pence.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nHarris on Supreme Court, abortion rights\n\nHarris turned a question about the future of abortion rights into an argument overfilling a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nAsked what her home state of California should do if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Harris segued to the ongoing fight over filling the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the recent death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Noting that the election is just 27 days away, Harris argued that the seat should be filled by whoever wins on Nov. 3.\n\nOn the subject of abortion, “I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body,” she said, emphasizing that the decision should rest with the woman – not Trump and Pence.\n\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\n\nHarris attacks Trump over military\n\nSen. Kamala Harris accused President Donald Trump of calling those who serve in the military “suckers” and “losers,” terms in news reports that Trump denied using.\n\nHarris said it was important to consider for the commander in chief that Trump asked at Arlington National Cemetery: “What’s in it for them?” She noted that Trump said the late Sen. John McCain didn’t deserve to be called a hero for his military service because he was a prisoner of war during Vietnam.\n\n“This is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about what they don’t care about,” Harris said.\n\nPence, whose son serves in the military, said Trump respects and reveres the military.\n\n“Any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous,” Pence said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nDodging questions a familiar theme\n\nBoth candidates tried to stay on message, which meant they weren’t particularly eager to answer questions that they saw as potentially problematic - especially on environmental issues.\n\nFor Pence, it was whether climate change is an “existential threat” that needs to be addressed with swift and aggressive action. Trump has questioned the science behind climate change and has called it a “hoax” despite assessments from his own administration that the threat is real and exacerbated by human activity.\n\n\"As I said, the climate is changing,\" Pence said without addressing the topic in any detail. \"We’ll follow the science.\"\n\nThen he pivoted back to a more favorable subject: taxes.\n\nFor Harris, it was the Green New Deal, the ultra-progressive plan to not only address climate change but to reconstruct the economy, which included a call for free housing for the poor and a quick end to fossil fuels.\n\nHarris, who was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, declined to talk about the proposal but instead pivoted to the Biden’s plan to create millions of jobs in the renewable energy sector and eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. Biden has rejected the Green New Deal.\n\nAfter dodging on the Green New Deal, she also went on the attack, saying “we have seen a pattern with this administration that they don’t believe in science.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nPence accuses Biden of not helping slain aid worker\n\nPence invited the parents of a humanitarian aid worker who was killed in Syria to the debate to help him make a point during a discussion of global leadership.\n\n“When Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month,” he said.\n\nMueller was abducted Aug. 4, 2013, and she endured rape and torture for 18 months. Her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller have said the Obama administration vowed to do everything it could to investigate her abduction, but everything wasn’t enough.\n\nPence praised Trump for taking decisive action in killing one of Mueller’s Islamic State tormenters, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nHarris said to the family that she knows about their daughter and she expressed her condolences.\n\n“What happened should never have happened,” she said. “And I know Joe Biden feels the same way.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Bart Jansen\n\nUnsurprising review: Trump praises his vice president's performance\n\nThe world's most famous COVID-19 patient is weighing in on the debate, and, not surprisingly, President Trump is giving the nod to his vice president over Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Mike Pence is doing GREAT! She is a gaffe machine,\" Trump said in one of several items posted during the debate.\n\nAmong other posts, Trump replayed a clip from the debate and mocked Biden over China.\n\nTrump's cheerleading drew mockery of its own.\n\n\"Pence and Trump have perfected the art of bullying the moderator, avoiding the questions and fostering a clown rodeo during debates,\" tweeted commentator Tim O'Brien.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPence seeks to paint Harris as liberal\n\nOne of Pence’s top goals in the debate Wednesday was to try to paint Harris as too liberal for the blue-collar voters in battleground states who backed President Barack Obama in the past but switched to President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nPence hammered away on the point throughout the first hour of the debate – in one exchange asserting that Harris, a California Democrat, was “the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders.”\n\nBut for much of the debate, Pence focused those attacks directly at Joe Biden rather than Harris herself. Pence questioned Biden’s campaign’s position on taxes, accused the Democrats of taking environmental stances – such as on the Green New Deal -- that he claimed would “kill jobs.”\n\nThe move put Harris on defense several times, countering that Biden’s position was not to ban fracking, for instance, and not to raise taxes on Americans earning more than $400,000.\n\nBiden has a long career as centrist Democrat in American politics, but the Trump campaign has frequently sought to paint the Biden-Harris ticket as being subsumed by the left-wing of the Democratic Party. The tension on that issue led to one of Biden’s most quoted moments in the presidential debate last week when he told Trump that “I am the Democratic Party.”\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nHarris says Trump ‘betrayed our friends’ overseas\n\nHarris accused the Trump-Pence administration of being cozy with U.S. adversaries and betraying the trust of NATO allies overseas.\n\n“You’ve got to be loyal to your friends,” Harris said. “What we’ve seen with Donald Trump is he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let’s take for example Russia.”\n\nHarris said Trump “took the word of Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community” when it came to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nShe said Trump has hurt America’s standing overseas because “Donald Trump doesn’t understand what it means to be honest.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPence says climate is changing but downplays storms, fires\n\nPence, asked about whether he believes that climate change has made natural disasters worse over the years, said he believes the climate is changing but downplayed the severity of recent hurricanes and fires.\n\n\"The climate is changing. The issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it,\" Pence said.\n\nHe continued by saying that a Biden administration would put the U.S. back into the Paris Accord, a 2015 climate agreement with nearly 200 countries that Trump pulled out of.\n\nPence said continued fires that have leveled communities on the West Coast could be helped with better forest management and said of hurricanes that \"there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.\"\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nHarris: Trump and Pence lost trade war with China\n\nHarris chided Pence for referring to the recent trade war with China as one of the Trump administration’s accomplishments.\n\n“You lost that trade war,” she said. “You lost it.”\n\nHarris said the trade war with Beijing has cost the U.S. manufacturing jobs and harmed the nation’s farmers, forcing many of them into bankruptcy.\n\n“We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month,” she said. “…This is where the economy is in America right now, and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.”\n\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\n\nTrade talk\n\nOn the subject of trade, Pence tried to attack Biden on China while Harris went after Pence for opposing the bailout of the auto industry.\n\nPence first disputed Harris’ critique of Trump’s handling of trade negotiations with China.\n\n“Lost a trade war with China? Joe Biden’s never fought it,” Pence said.\n\nHe accused Biden of being a “cheerleader of Communist China through the last several decades.”\n\nHarris responded that Biden “is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it.” She was referring to Biden’s role, as Obama’s vice president, in helping auto manufacturers recover from the Great Recession and Pence’s opposition to the approach as a member of the House.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nPence and Harris spar over Obamacare\n\nHarris attacked the Trump administration for trying to abolish the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature health care law.\n\n\"If you have pre-existing conditions, heart disease, diabetes breast cancer - they're coming for you,\" Harris said.\n\nThe Trump administration has backed a Supreme Court challenge that could undo protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nAbout 100 million people in the U.S. could see higher premiums or out-of-pocket costs if the ACA’s pre-existing condition protection is repealed.\n\nPence called the ACA, also known as Obamacare, a \"disaster.\" He claimed the Trump administration has a plan to improve health care and protect people with pre-existing conditions, which is already in place under Obamacare, but offered no details on a plan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 to end surprise medical billing and protect people with pre-existing conditions, but the directive has no legal weight and did not detail how it would be implemented.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nHarris: Trump, Pence ‘don’t believe in science’\n\nHarris slammed the Trump-Pence administration on environmental policy, accusing the administration of not “believing in science.”\n\n“Joe understands that the west coast of our country is burning including my home state of California,” Harris said.\n\n“Joe believes in science,” she said. “We’ve seen a pattern from this administration – and that’s they don’t believe in science.”\n\nHarris did not directly address a question about her past support for the new Green New Deal. She pushed back at Pence’s charges that Biden wants to ban fracking.\n\n“Joe Biden will not ban fracking,” she said.\n\nModerator Susan Page then asked Pence whether he believes climate change is an existential threat to the country.\n\n“We’ll follow the science,” Pence said, but then quickly shifted, accusing Harris and Biden of wanting to raise taxes.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nPence's interruptions drawing boos on social media\n\nPence has made his share of interruptions over both Harris and debate moderator Susan Page, and it hasn't gone unnoticed on social media.\n\n\"A white man talking over two women is a very 1950s approach to debating,\" tweeted Barack Obama administration official Chris Lu.\n\nRepublicans say Pence is just trying to set the record straight, but other observers said it has set a mood.\n\n\"Pence not exactly looking like a Happy Warrior,\" historian Michael Beschloss tweeted.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHarris, Pence contrast on style, not just policy\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of the debate, the contrast between the liberal African American senator from California and the conservative vice president from Indiana wasn’t just policy, it was style as well.\n\nHarris was animated, smiling often and repeatedly shaking her head when she disagreed with Pence. Pence was more measured, interrupting at times, telling her at one point “you’re entitled to your own opinion but not your facts.”\n\nAt one point, Harris talked about the “memorable” day that Biden offered her a place on the ticket.\n\n“I though of my mother who came to the U.S. (from India) at the age of 19 … And the thought that I’d be sitting here I know would make her proud,” she said, as she briefly looked skyward. “She must looking down on us.\n\nPence graciously acknowledged her place in history.\n\n“I never expected to be on the stage four years ago so I know the feeling,” he said.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBack-and-forth on Taxes\n\nPence said the “American economy” is on the ballot, in response to a question about taxes.\n\n“You just heard Sen. Harris tell you, on Day 1, Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes,” Pence said.\n\nHarris protested: “That’s not what I said.”\n\nPence then accused Biden of wanting to also “bury the economy under a Green New Deal,” abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking.\n\nHarris retorted that she thought “this is supposed to be a debate based on facts.”\n\n“You’re entitled to your own opinion but you’re not entitled to your own facts,” she said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nHarris attacks Trump taxes\n\nSen. Kamala Harris attacked President Donald Trump for how much he paid in income taxes, after the New York Times reported he paid $750 a year for two recent years.\n\n“We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million,” Harris said in response to a question about greater transparency about the health of a president. “It’d be really good to know who the commander in chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president’s decisions.”\n\n“Donald Trump has been about covering up everything,” Harris added.\n\nVice President Mike Pence shook his head as Harris spoke. Pence said Trump has called the report inaccurate and that he paid tens of millions of dollars in payroll and property taxes.\n\nPence called Trump a businessman who created tens of thousands of jobs. Pence said Trump began four years ago to “turn this economy around, cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, fighting for free and fair trade.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nHarris says she and Biden share same values\n\nHarris said Biden chose her as his running mate because they share the same values.\n\n“Joe and I were raised in a very similar way,” she said. “We were raised with values that are about our work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people.”\n\nHarris said she and Biden “share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people.”\n\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\n\nDodging the question\n\nPence didn’t answer the question posed by the moderator who asked he’s talked to Trump about what would happen if Trump can’t adequately do his job.\n\nUnder the 25th amendment, the president can temporarily transfer power to the vice president if he can’t sufficiently handle his duties. That could happen if, for example, the president’s COVID-19 illness worsens.\n\nInstead, Pence accused Harris of playing politics by saying she wouldn’t take Trump’s word that a vaccine is safe. He also attacked the Obama administration’s handling of the swine flu.\n\n\"Harris also didn't tackle the question head-on either; instead, she talked about her qualifications for the job.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nHarris says she wouldn't trust Trump's word on a vaccine\n\nDuring a spirited back and forth with Pence over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Harris said she would only take a vaccine to treat COVID-19 if medical experts endorse it.\n\nShe made clear she would not do so if only Trump says to take the vaccine. “If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it – absolutely,” Harris said. “But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it.”\n\nPence accused Harris of “undermining the public confidence in a vaccine.”\n\n— Joey Garrison.\n\nPence says administration trusts American people to follow guidelines despite White House outbreak\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the Trump administration has \"great confidence\" in the American people to follow federal health guidelines on stopping the spread of the coronavirus despite a Rose Garden event 11 days ago that has emerged as a potential super spreader event for senior adminsitration officials and congressional officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, several White House officials and congressional allies tested positive for COVID-19 after attending an event to announce the president's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Few people were spotted in masks and were seated shoulder to shoulder.\n\nPence said that \"many of the people\" at the veent were tested for coronavirus and pointed out that the event was outdoors.\n\n\"President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health,\" Pence said.\n\nPence accused Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden of focusing on coronavirus mandates, adding: \"We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\"\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nHarris: Trump administration 'inept' dealing with virus\n\nSen. Kamala Harris accused the Trump administration of hiding information about the severity and lethality of the coronavirus after learning about it in late January.\n\nParents worried about their children getting sick. Workers worried about losing their jobs. But the administration was inept for failing to describe the risks they faced and the precautions there were necessary, Harris said.\n\n“The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration,” Harris said. “That is asking too much of the people.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nDifferent candidates, different tone\n\nMinutes into the presidential debate last month it was clear President Donald Trump came to the stage with a plan to aggressively confront Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nIt was equally clear just minutes into Wednesday’s vice presidential debate that both campaigns had reassessed their approach after that confrontation. Pence remained silent as Harris ripped into the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus.\n\n“This administration has forfeited their right to reelection,” she said.\n\nHarris was silent as Pence defended the high U.S. death toll, even as Pence took a shot at the former vice president over past scandals involving plagiarism.\n\n“The reality is when you look at the Biden plan,” Pence says, “it looks a little like plagiarism.”\n\nThat, Pence said, is “something that Joe Bien knows a little bit about.”\n\nDuring their first discussion period, both Harris and Pence quickly shot down interruptions from their opponents.\n\n\"I'm speaking,\" Harris asserted as Pence tried to jump in.\n\nThe Sept. 29 presidential debate was widely panned after it quickly went off the rails as both candidates hurled insults at each other and Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden, forcing moderator Chris Wallace to press the president to allow Biden to speak.\n\nIn a clear recognition of the earlier debate, moderator Susan Page of USA TODAY offered a warning to the candidates at the start.\n\n“We want a debate that is lively but America also deserves a debate that is civil,” she said.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nAnd they’re off\n\nThe first and only vice presidential debate of the 2020 election is underway.\n\nPence and Harris are facing off in Salt Lake City, Utah, at a critical moment in the race, as President Donald Trump is battling COVID-19, talks over a stimulus to blunt the economic impact of the pandemic has stalled (again) and several battleground polls show Democratic nominee Joe Biden with a narrow but growing lead.\n\nThe two candidates will fight it out for 90 minutes over the virus, the economy, health care and other issues. Trump’s approach to the presidency might come up, too.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nDonald Trump campaign event Monday in Pittsburgh? Campaign explores possibility\n\nAs Mike Pence and Kamala Harris debate, President Donald Trump's aides are working to satisfy his desire to get back out on the campaign trail as soon as possible – perhaps early next week.\n\nThe campaign is exploring the prospect of an event on Monday in Pittsburgh, an aide said. The aide did not elaborate, saying only it would be an \"event\" and not a \"rally\" for the COVID-stricken president.\n\nTrump, who is still recovering from the virus, also wants to make the debate with Joe Biden in Miami, scheduled for a week from Thursday.\n\nIt's uncertain whether Trump will be able to make either campaign stop.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nYou’re on your own, debate attendees\n\nGetting a seat in the audience for a national debate is usually a hot ticket.\n\nThis year, as for many events taking place during the pandemic, there’s a big caveat in the fine print.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates and the host site, the University of Utah, want ticket holders to know that when it comes to coronavirus, they’re on their own.\n\n“The ticket holder relieves the CPD and the event site host of any and all liability of any kind and character....in the event of fire, natural disaster...injury or sickness (including COVID-19),” the ticket advises in red letters.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nDebate guests assemble\n\nGuests who won the lottery for tickets to the vice presidential debate wore salmon-colored surgical masks issued by the host University of Utah.\n\nMichelle Pedersen, 44, who is studying opera performance and who has performed on the stage where the candidates will appear, said she was excited about the experience.\n\n\"It will be incredibly memorable because we have a female, who is going to be fabulous, up there tonight,” Pedersen said.\n\nJuliette Ainsworth, 40, from France, voiced some concern about the future because of COVID-19, but not health cares for the debate.\n\n\"I'm worried for the future but not for the debate tonight,” Ainsworth said. “I think everybody has been taken care of.\"\n\nJustin Ravago, 19, an undergraduate in business economics from Boise, Idaho, said he was looking forward to a more proper debate than the presidential candidates held last week.\n\n\"I want to hear what they have to say rather than a crossfire of words,” Ravago said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBackers of both sides make their case\n\nThe official protest area outside the security perimeter of the vice presidential debate seemed to be dominated not by supporters of either Mike Pence or Kamala Harris but by demonstrators upset about Turkey.\n\nStill, there were enough people there for the presidential politics that some heated debates ensued.\n\n“Make America what it was before Trump,” a Joe Biden supporter yelled back at a group of Donald Trump backers.\n\nThe Trump supporters booed as a truck drove by, blaming Pence, as chair of the administration’s coronavirus task force, for the number of people dying from COVID-19.\n\nChris Quinones, 52, of Park City, Utah, said she came to the campus to show her support for the president because she’s for “law and order.”\n\n“We don’t want to see our country look like New York City,” she said.\n\nQuinones, who wore an Army face mask and a blue Trump hat, said she voted for Hillary Clinton four years ago because, “I didn’t know any better.”\n\nQuinones said her eyes were opened during the impeachment of the president. She felt that Trump’s actions were being taken out of context.\n\n“I did a 180,” she said of her support for Trump.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nUniversity of Utah students will attend the debate\n\nThe University of Utah held a ticket lottery for students, with 60 lucky winners allocated a seat in the hall.\n\n\"In order not to detract from the live televised event for the many millions of people watching the broadcast, live audience members shall refrain from expressing approval or disapproval of events on stage as the debate unfolds,” the tickets state.\n\nKingsbury Hall, the venue for tonight's vice presidential debate, is the performing arts center on the University of Utah campus and opened in 1930. The debate seal — an eagle with the legend \"The Union and the Constitution forever\" — hangs from the ceiling.\n\nThe ticket also says members of the audience will not hold the Commission on Presidential Debates or the event host liable for any sickness including COVID-19.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nThe view from across the street\n\nSophomores Cooper McGee and Jake Larsen sat in lawn chairs on the ledge outside the second-story windows of their student rental house, taking in the vice presidential spectacle across the street at the University of Utah.\n\n“I figured we’d be missing out if we didn’t,” McGee, a 20-year-old from Boise, Idaho, who is studying business management at the university and had just finished an online class.\n\nThe Biden Harris 2020 signs in their yard made clear which side they’re supporting in the debate.\n\n“I really don’t feel like America is headed in the right direction under Trump,” McGee said. “If I were not speaking out, then I’m not doing my part.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nPence concedes on plexiglass\n\nThe spat over plexiglass is over – and the plexiglass won.\n\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence requested plexiglass not be placed on his side of the vice presidential debate stage -- arguing it wasn’t necessary to protect the spread of COVID-19 -- the Pence team conceded late Tuesday.\n\nFrank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates, told the New York Times that Pence’s staff agreed to accept the placement of the plexiglass dividers.\n\nPence and Harris will sit 12 feet and 3 inches from each other with tables in front of them. Plexiglass will be to each of their sides, photos of the debate stage show.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates made the plexiglass part of new safety guidelines installed after President Donald Trump and several Republican allies tested positive for COVID-19 just days following last week’s first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBut Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, objected, saying that it wasn’t needed because of other safety accommodations including daily testing and the extended separation between the candidates on stage.\n\n“If she wants it, she’s more than welcome to surround herself with plexiglass if that makes her feel more comfortable,” Short told The Washington Post on Tuesday before later conceding.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nWho says debates can’t be fun?\n\nCoronavirus. Bible. Systemic Racism. Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nThose are some of the words that could win a Bingo during the vice presidential debate.\n\nCustomized “Debate Bingo” cards are scattered along the tables in the media filing hall at the University of Utah.\n\nThere’s even a Bingo stamping device (which this reporter initially thought was hand sanitizer) to stamp the cards as keywords rush by Mental fitness. Electoral College. Masks. Voter Fraud.\n\nBingo!\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nHow to watch, what to watch in Harris-Pence matchup\n\nPence and Harris will meet Wednesday for their only debate. The 90-minute event begins at 9 p.m. ET and won’t be hard to find: It’ll be broadcast on every major network. Viewers streaming on USATODAY.com will have the added benefit of real-time fact-checking and political context.\n\nWhat to watch for? To begin with, the debate comes as the nation has watched President Donald Trump fight his own case of COVID-19, and a steady stream of White House officials also test positive. That issue, and the issue of how the White House has responded, is guaranteed to be front and center.\n\nThere are other top themes as well. Both candidates will try to sell themselves as a credible replacement for whoever becomes the president in an election in which both candidates are in their mid-70s (Trump is 74 and Biden is 77). That dynamic in particular makes this vice presidential debate potentially more interesting than those that have come before it.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City, and John Fritze\n\nRepublican attorneys general attack Harris\n\nRepublican attorneys general slammed Kamala Harris ahead of Wednesday night’s vice presidential debate, accusing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate of spewing “dangerous rhetoric” and showing “absolute disregard for the rule of law.”\n\nAttorneys general from Louisiana, Utah and Arkansas went after Harris’ record as California’s attorney general and as a U.S. senator, specifically citing her stance on immigration, energy, gun control, policing and other issues. The criticism could foreshadow Vice President Mike Pence’s line of attack against Harris during the debate at the University of Utah.\n\n“Kamala Harris is dangerous and divisive,” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said during a news conference in Salt Lake City. “She had no business being the attorney general of California with her disregard for the rule of law. She has no business being a U.S. senator. And Kamala Harris certainly has no business being the vice president of the United States.”\n\nHarris, who has served as California’s junior Democratic senator since 2017, was the state’s attorney general for six years before entering Congress. Republicans have heavily scrutinized her record as attorney general, arguing that it provides some insight to the kind of policies she would pursue if she and Biden are elected in November.\n\n“We do not aspire the United States to be California,” said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. “However, if we elect a Biden-Harris ticket, that’s exactly what the American people are going to get.”\n\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\n\nCampaign: Harris’ goal is not to 'eviscerate' Pence\n\nMany Biden campaign supporters are hoping to see Sen. Kamala Harris take on Vice President Mike Pence the way the former prosecutor went after Brett Kavanaugh, Jeff Sessions and others who have testified before the Senate committees on which she serves. (In fact, that was the first remark this reporter heard from her taxi driver after arriving in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.)\n\nHarris’ tough debating reputation was also cemented by her attack on Joe Biden’s past opposition to busing during the Democratic presidential debates last year.\n\nBut Harris isn’t coming to the vice presidential debate stage “to eviscerate” Pence, said Symone Sanders, senior adviser to the Biden campaign.\n\n“She is there to really talk to people at home and breakthrough about what they're feeling, their lives and their families,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nThat’s a smart strategy, according to Christine Matthews, a GOP pollster and Trump critic. Matthews tweeted that she understands Harris’ team has been studying research on how voters perceive women in these situations.\n\n“She will be fighting stereotypes of a 'nasty’ woman while she makes contrast points,” Matthews tweeted.\n\nResearch by the Barbara Lee Foundation shows voters will back a male candidate they don’t like, if they think that he’s qualified. But they won’t vote for a woman if she’s not “likeable.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nPoll: Voters more 'cold' than 'warm' on both Pence, Harris\n\nNeither of the vice presidential candidates are eliciting warm, fuzzy feelings from a majority of voters, according to a new Pew Research Center survey released before the vice presidential debate.\n\nAbout half (51%) of registered voters give Pence “cold” ratings and a slightly smaller share (48%) said the same about Harris.\n\nSlightly more than one-third (36%) feel “warmly” toward Pence; 39% do about Harris.\n\nThe ratings largely reflect partisan differences with most Republicans feeling positive about Pence but negative about Harris. The reverse is true for Democrats, according to the Sept. 30-Oct. 5 survey of 11,929 adults, including 10,543 registered voters.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nHarris’ debate guests\n\nTwo of the limited number of guests Kamala Harris can bring to the debate under COVID restrictions are Utah residents who the campaign says represent “the communities and the families that a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will fight for.”\n\nTeacher Deborah Gatrell is a Blackhawk pilot and Army National Guard veteran. She’s also the only Democrat running for the Salt Lake City council.\n\n“As we all know, down-ballot change is where we see progress made,” Liz Allen, communications director for Harris, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nState Rep. Angela Romero will also be cheering on Harris from inside the debate hall. The campaign called her a longtime community organizer for progressive causes, equality and social justice.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nPoll: Who will win debate vs. who is better prepared for the Oval Office\n\nWho voters expect to win the vice presidential debate is different from which candidate they think is better prepared to become president, according to a new Morning Consult/Politico poll.\n\nVoters surveyed Oct. 2-4 gave the debating edge to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., over Vice President Mike Pence: 43% to 37%. That’s due primarily to independents picking Harris while Democrats and Republicans backed their party’s own running mates.\n\nBut 57% of voters said they believed Pence is prepared to step into the Oval Office if necessary compared with 50% for Harris.\n\nPence did better overall because more Democrats found him prepared to be president than the share of Republicans who said the same of Harris.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\n\nWestward Ho!\n\nThe vice presidential candidates are staying in the West following their debate in Salt Lake City.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is scheduled to go to Nevada on Thursday and Arizona on Friday.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris are heading to Arizona on Thursday, where they’re expected to meet with American Indian tribal leaders and embark on a “Soul of the Nation” bus tour.\n\nHarris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is campaigning in Colorado on Thursday and Friday.\n\nBiden is expected to be in Nevada on Friday.\n\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/politics/trump-world-justice-department-subpoenas-analysis/index.html", "title": "Justice Department subpoena storm broadens Trump's potential ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA strikingly broad subpoena sweep against more than 30 former officials and campaign aides of ex-President Donald Trump represents the clearest sign yet of the seriousness of the Department of Justice’s criminal probe into events surrounding the US Capitol insurrection.\n\nThe gambit, revealed on Monday, also shows that while Trump may succeed in slowing a separate investigation into the retention of classified information at Mar-a-Lago, his potential exposure to legal consequences is deep and threatening. Trump has not been charged with a crime in either probe.\n\nBut the subpoenas show that the DOJ’s investigation, which has proceeded behind the scenes for months and caused Trump critics to express frustration with Attorney General Merrick Garland, is far more expansive than was previously known. And it appears to be intensifying, with investigators apparently narrowing their focus based on other subpoenas, evidence and witness testimony.\n\n“This is the way classic investigations are conducted, moving up the chain so to speak,” David Laufman, former chief of the Justice Department’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday.\n\n“They are now encompassing individuals closer and closer to the President to learn more and more about what the President knew and when he knew it.”\n\nThe twice-impeached former President has typically been successful at wriggling free of legal scrutiny and scandals that would long have ended the careers of conventional politicians. But it is clear that he is facing legal concerns on multiple fronts, some related to his attempt to overthrow the result of the 2020 election, and all in some ways arising from his view that as president, and even back in civilian life, his position granted him almost unlimited power free of scrutiny.\n\nNew indications of the DOJ’s interest in post-election intrigue\n\nNews of the more than 30 new subpoenas for documents and some for testimony before a grand jury suggest the DOJ is investigating a scheme to create slates of fake electors to invalidate President Joe Biden’s wins in swing states in 2020. There are also indications that prosecutors are looking at Trump’s fundraising operation and the way that the ex-President’s January 6, 2021, “Stop the Steal” rally was organized, according to new information reported by CNN, some of which was first revealed by The New York Times.\n\nThe flurry of subpoenas in recent days came just ahead of a 60-day quiet period that the DOJ generally seeks to avoid the appearance of influencing elections with politically sensitive investigations. Midterm elections in November will decide the destiny of the Senate and the House of Representatives and multiple state and local positions. Trump, touting his false claims that he was illegally ejected from power in a fraudulent election, has been a key player in the 2022 campaign.\n\nTrump acolytes who received subpoenas include his former campaign manager Bill Stepien and Sean Dollman, the campaign’s former chief financial officer, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump’s former deputy chief of staff and social media guru Dan Scavino also received a subpoena, according to a source familiar with the matter. None of the three men responded to requests for comment. Brian Jack, the last White House political director under Trump, was subpoenaed as well, according to a source familiar with the situation. Jack also did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nThe revelation comes as the House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection meets on Tuesday to discuss next steps in its investigation and possible new televised hearings following a series of scripted sessions over the summer that painted a deeply damning picture of Trump’s behavior following the last election.\n\nThe committee is expected to discuss whether to invite Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence to appear. Committee members do not expect either man to testify, sources said, but some believe they should be asked for the record given the extraordinary circumstances of the former President’s attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after a democratic election.\n\nThis subplot is also playing out amid an investigation in Georgia into alleged attempts to try to get local officials to overturn Biden’s victory in the critical swing state.\n\nTrump and DOJ trade blows in classified documents case\n\nAll these probes have in recent days been overshadowed by yet another legal duel over Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which led to a prolonged standoff with the DOJ and eventually resulted in an FBI search of his property last month.\n\nLawyers for the former President argued in a new filing in that case on Monday that a judge should reject the DOJ’s attempt to continue to review classified material as part of its criminal investigation. The department says that the judge’s original prohibition against it doing so effectively makes it impossible for the intelligence community to assess the potential damage from the former President’s apparently lax handling of classified information and presents a grave risk to national security.\n\nIn a characteristically expansive interpretation of the position of president, Trump argued in a Monday filing that in his former position, he had broad authority to declassify records and that a former president, should have “absolute right of access” to presidential records – whether they are classified or not. CNN has reported that multiple former senior national security officials dismiss the idea that the ex-President had some kind of scheme to declassify documents en masse. And even if he had, the Presidential Records Act states that presidential documents belong in the National Archives.\n\nBut in an audacious move, Trump’s legal team sought to downplay the significance of the dispute.\n\n“In what at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the Government wrongfully seeks to criminalize the possession by the 45th President of his own Presidential and personal records,” Trump’s legal team wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over the case as Trump seeks to have a third-party attorney known as a special master sift through the documents for privilege issues.\n\nEach of the Trump team’s claims is highly contentious and appear to conflict with most conventional readings of US law. The argument that Mar-a-Lago was a secure facility and that the evidence was kept in a locked room appears to ignore the fact that some of the 100 documents taken by the FBI from Trump’s home bore the highest levels of classification of the US government and would normally be permitted to be viewed only by a select level of official in the most highly secured venues. And the Washington Post reported last week that the secrets of a foreign nation’s nuclear program was among information the FBI took from his residence. Such intelligence would be among the most highly protected and restricted information in the government’s possession.\n\nTrump’s arguments might appear in many cases to be outlandish. But they could also achieve something he wants – delaying any potential formal legal moves against him for as long as possible by opening up even more appeals in layers of the court system.\n\nIn the case of the classified documents drama, that could mean the case stretches well into the 2024 campaign when Trump is expected to mount a bid to win back the White House. The former President has already slammed the DOJ’s action as an example of political persecution, a charge he would be certain to escalate during the heat of a run for the presidency.\n\nBut the new indications on Monday of the comprehensive nature of the investigations into the lead up to January 6 raise the question of just how long Trump can keep at bay the multiple investigations arising from his inability to accept his 2020 loss.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/21/coronavirus-updates-state-lockdowns-trump-immigration-cuomo/5166319002/", "title": "Coronavirus updates: Senate's $484B stimulus deal; Trump, Cuomo ...", "text": "The Senate approved a $484 billion stimulus package Tuesday afternoon via voice vote, right around the time New York Gov.

McConnell, R-Ky., lauded the deal as a \"bipartisan agreement.\"\n\nThe $484 billion bill, approved by voice vote, will inject the program, which provides loans to small businesses, with more than $320 billion, according to McConnell. A portion will be set aside for smaller businesses that don't have established relationships with banks and had a harder time accessing the funds in the first round of loans. It will also bolster the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program, which had also dried up due to the coronavirus.\n\n-- Christal Hayes\n\nCuomo: White House visit 'functional and effective'\n\nPresident Donald Trump and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made nice after an Oval Office meeting Tuesday as the administration and U.S. governors remain locked in a dispute over coronavirus testing.\n\nCuomo called the meeting \"functional and effective.\" He described the president as \"inquisitive\" about New York's timeline for reopening but said Trump did not attempt to impose a deadline for that milestone. Trump said they had a \"very productive\" session in which he and the governor signed off on a plan to double testing in New York over the next few weeks.\n\nThe unusual visit from Cuomo, which the president announced a day earlier, came as New York state works to pull out of its particularly deadly bout with the virus. Trump and Cuomo, a Democrat, have lurched between slamming and applauding each other in closely watched news conferences during the health crisis.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nTrump: Harvard will return stimulus money\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Harvard University would return coronavirus stimulus money intended for small businesses – “They shouldn’t have taken it,” he said – and added that he would ask other large entities to give back money as well. Later in his coronavirus news briefing, Trump clarified that the university has not agreed it should return the funds. \"If they won’t do that, then we’ll do something else,\" he said without elaborating. Harvard has come under fire for taking nearly $9 million in funding from the relief package, especially in light of the school's multi-billion-dollar endowment.\n\nHarvard released a statement Tuesday saying it did not request or receive funds from the Paycheck Protection Program intended for small businesses. Rather, the university said it received a portion of Department of Education funding that was distributed to thousands of schools across the country, and that it plans to use the money to help students facing urgent financial needs because of the pandemic.\n\n​-- John Fritze\n\nGreen cards halted for 60 days\n\nPresident Donald Trump said his executive order would halt new green card awards for at least 60 days and would be reevaluated after that period. Trump stressed his new move would not affect temporary workers, such as seasonal workers arriving from other countries through several visa programs.\n\nTrump said his executive order, which the White House had not yet provided, would “only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency; in other words, those receiving green cards.”\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nFDA approves home-testing kit\n\nHealth care workers and first responders who may have been exposed to the coronavirus will soon get access to a home diagnostic test.\n\nLabCorp, a global life sciences company based in North Carolina, on Tuesday received Food and Drug Administration authorization for kits that enable people to collect nasal swab samples at home and mail them to a laboratory for testing.\n\nThe FDA’s emergency-use authorization is the first for a COVID-19 in-home test. The procedure reduces the need for personal protective equipment because no clinician is required to take a sample. LabCorp said it hopes to make the tests available to other U.S. consumers in coming weeks, assuming supplies last. The company declined to elaborate.\n\n— Kevin McCoy\n\nStudy shows no benefit from malaria drug Trump has touted for treatment\n\nA malaria drug widely touted by President Donald Trump for treating the coronavirus showed no benefit in a large analysis of its use in U.S. veterans hospitals. There were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care, researchers reported.\n\nThe nationwide study was not a rigorous experiment. But with 368 patients, it’s the largest look so far of hydroxychloroquine with or without the antibiotic azithromycin for COVID-19. The study was posted on an online site for researchers and has been submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine, but has not been reviewed by other scientists.\n\n-- The Associated Press\n\nMixed response to Georgia reopening plans\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp's plans to relax restrictions are drawing mixed reactions, with business owners expressing excitement but also anxiety, and mayors saying they were blindsided.\n\nAmid a series of protests across the nation demanding immediate action to reopen states, Kemp announced plans Monday to allow gyms, bowling alleys, hair and nail salons, massage therapists and more to reopen their doors as early as Friday if they adhere to social distancing measures and hygiene requirements. Bars, nightclubs and entertainment operations will remain closed, but restaurants and theaters will be able to reopen April 27.\n\nSeveral mayors in Georgia said they weren't given any notice of the announcement and questioned the governor's decision. As of Tuesday evening, the state had more than 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 818 deaths, according to the Georgia Department of Health.\n\n-- Grace Hauck and Nicquel Terry Ellis\n\nAmazon, Target workers highlight health concerns\n\nAmazon and Target workers are planning sickouts to raise awareness about the health risks they face delivering groceries and other supplies to Americans.\n\nMore than 350 Amazon warehouse workers in 50 locations pledged to call out from their jobs starting Tuesday, according to Athena, a coalition of local and national organizations representing workers. Target workers are planning a mass sickout May 1, said Adam Ryan, a liaison with Target Workers Unite, an employee activist group.\n\n-- Kelly Tyko\n\nWHO says virus was not produced in lab\n\nAll the available evidence indicates coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory as has been alleged, the World Health Organization says. \"It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,\" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said in Geneva. The global health body's remarks follow confirmation from President Donald Trump last week that his administration was probing whether the coronavirus originated in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease first emerged.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nStocks and oil prices plunge; Trump says relief may be on the way\n\nWith oil prices tumbling again Tuesday, U.S. stocks took their worst loss in weeks as economies worldwide continued to get battered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe cost for a barrel of U.S. oil to be delivered in June plunged 43% to $11.57. That’s the part of the market that oil traders are focused on and trading most actively. For oil to be delivered next month, which is when storage tanks could top out, the cost of a barrel stood at $10.01. A day earlier, it fell below zero for the first time.\n\nThe crumbling oil market helped drag stocks to their second straight day of losses, and the S&P 500 lost 3.1% for its worst drop since April 1. It followed up on similar declines across Europe and Asia.\n\nNurses protest outside White House\n\nRegistered nurses marched and waved signs in front of the White House on Tuesday, calling attention to the tens of thousands of health care workers nationwide who have become infected with COVID-19 because of the lack of personal protective equipment. The nurses, members of National Nurses United, were practicing social distancing and read aloud the names of U.S. nurses who are known to have died of COVID-19. The union wants, among other things, for President Trump to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to order the mass production of N95 respirators, face shields, gowns, gloves and shoe coverings, as well as ventilators and COVID-19 testing kits.\n\nDoubts about Tokyo Olympics in 2021\n\nLast month's postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until the 2021 summer was a painful but expected move amid the coronavirus pandemic. Perhaps more stunning: The event might not take place next year either.\n\n“I don’t think the Olympics is likely to be held next year,” Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious disease at Kobe University in Japan, said on a teleconference. “Holding the Olympics needs two conditions; one, controlling COVID-19 in Japan, and controlling COVID-19 everywhere.”\n\nToshiro Muto, CEO of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has not sounded optimistic either. “I don’t think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not,” Muto said. “We certainly are not in a position to give you a clear answer.”\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nNational Spelling Bee, running of the bulls, Oktoberfest canceled\n\nThe Scripps National Spelling Bee has been canceled for the first time since 1945 due to the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced. The event is typically held in June, but organizers determined there was \"no clear path to safely set a new date in 2020.\"\n\nIn Germany, Oktoberfest was canceled, Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said. The beer festival, scheduled to open Sept. 19 and run through Oct. 4, expected nearly 6 million guests.

But his trial of nerves with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is holding Ukraine hostage in a bid to reverse the West’s expansion after the Cold War, is far from his only global headache.\n\nOn the other side of the globe, a strategic ballet of military might is playing out as the US and China maneuver armadas and warplanes amid tensions over Taiwan, and other disputed territories, in a long-term duel for dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. While the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is fixating the world right now, a future Chinese strike against the self-governing democratic island is the more likely trigger for a disastrous superpower conflict.\n\nThen there is the Middle East, from which America has been trying to extricate itself for years. US forces at a base in Abu Dhabi leapt into action early Monday, using Patriot missiles to shoot down several missiles flung at the Gulf emirate by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The emergency was a reminder that despite some hopes of renewed nuclear talks with Iran, the Islamic Republic’s regional power plays are a grave risk to US personnel. And the vicious war in Yemen, prosecuted by Washington ally Saudi Arabia with terrible civilian consequences, endangers the US by association.\n\nAnd if Washington was tempted to forget the frightening prospect of a nuclear North Korea, its leader Kim Jong Un has other ideas. One of a string of recent missile tests by Pyongyang triggered extraordinary ground stops at some US West Coast airports, which underscored the nightmare scenario for any US President that the extreme hermit state could have the US mainland in its sights.\n\nPutting American power to the test\n\nEach of these challenges concern foreign states and nationalistic leaders making hard-eyed decisions to advance strategic goals, seeking to increase their power, expand or cement anti-democratic political systems and dominate their spheres of influence outside their own sovereign territory. They also know that with the US under pressure elsewhere, they may have an opening.\n\nPutin, for example, is well aware that Biden wants to pivot to the China threat – so it makes sense to probe to see whether the US is distracted. Beijing, for one, would be happy for the US to get bogged down in Europe. The US probably needs China to help cool North Korea’s provocations. And Russia is a key player in the Iran nuclear talks. It didn’t go unnoticed in Washington that Iran, Russia and China held a third set of naval drills in the Indian Ocean last week.\n\nSince the US is, still, the world’s dominant power, with allies across the globe, and the leader of the democratic bloc of nations, each thrust by one of its adversaries draws it deeper into a confrontation and preventive diplomacy.\n\nThe building challenges to US authority come at a moment when there is a widespread perception abroad that Washington is not the power it was for the second half of the 20th century. Despite Biden’s assurances that “America is Back,” the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year raised questions about US competence and commitment. US adversaries know Americans are exhausted by 20 years of war abroad, a factor that may lead some to calculate that Washington could waver on its strategic obligations for political reasons.\n\nAnd foreign leaders understand domestic US politics too. With a significant percentage of the country convinced Biden is illegitimate thanks to former President Donald Trump’s election lies, and Republicans lambasting him as weak under Putin’s challenge, there’s rarely been a better time for foreign nations to test a modern President’s character and stamina. The possibility that Trump, who was a four-year force for global instability, could return to office, meanwhile, has some allies doubting that the US can keep any commitments it does make.\n\nSome foreign leaders might look at events in Washington on Monday and wonder whether the stress is beginning to weigh on the President. After a White House event, Biden was asked about inflation by a Fox reporter and in a stunningly unguarded moment on an open mic, he responded: “What a stupid son of a bitch.” The President later called the reporter to apologize.\n\nPutin’s infuriating maneuvering\n\nEach of the geopolitical factors listed above are on display in Putin’s challenge to the West over Ukraine as he seeks to restore some of the strategic sway once held by the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe around the symbolic 30th anniversary of his beloved empire’s collapse.\n\nAfter massing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, the Russian leader made a series of demands for US concessions, including an assurance that the Kyiv government will never join NATO and for the alliance to pull back troops and armaments from ex-Warsaw Pact states that joined the West since they feared the kind of Russian resurgence that Putin is trying to engineer.\n\nBiden has responded by seeking a gradual escalation of pressure designed to convince Putin that the cost of invading Ukraine would be too high, promising sanctions that could cripple the Russian economy and cause knock-on political threats to his rule.\n\nNow, the President is mulling a reinforcement of NATO’s eastern flank with possible troop deployments. The alliance on Monday announced some smaller deployments to the Baltic and Eastern European member states. For the first time since the Cold War, a US carrier strike group will be placed under NATO command in the Mediterranean for a high-level maritime exercise this week.\n\nThis is all meant to project resolve, deterrence and to show that Putin’s attempt to get the US out of Europe will fail. It is incumbent on Biden to show Washington has the back of its allies. If he doesn’t, NATO will count for nothing. But it’s a high-risk plan since US deployments could prompt the Russian leader to pull the trigger he has to Ukraine’s head and to argue he must invade to protect Russian security.\n\nPutin is an infuriating, unpredictable adversary, and has forced the US to react to his provocations for weeks. It’s impossible to read his intentions. US diplomacy so far, including a Biden-Putin meeting in Geneva last year and more recent online encounters between the presidents, have yielded no breakthroughs. It has, however, handed Putin the prestige of Cold War-style summits that led Republicans to accuse Biden of that dreaded word – appeasement.\n\nIn the latest demonstration of Putin’s penchant for mind games, he and Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel spoke by phone on Monday and agreed to deeper cooperation. Some Russian military officials have suggested deploying military assets to Cuba and Venezuela during the crisis over Ukraine. The allusions to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 – the US-Soviet standoff in which the world came close to nuclear war – are hard to miss.\n\nMore showdowns lie in wait for Biden\n\nSome analysts believe that Putin has put himself in a box and will be unable to exit the showdown without at least a limited penetration into Ukraine that would save face. This is why Biden whipped up so much controversy last week when he suggested that a “minor incursion” by Russia would not draw the full sanctions broadside. But the US President was also telling the truth, apparently referring to divisions among allies in Europe about how to handle Putin.\n\nThe Russian leader’s timing is no accident as he tries to probe divisions between European powers internally and with the United States over the crisis. This is a transitional period for the three major European powers. Germany has a new governing coalition that is split on foreign policy, knows it is reliant on Russian gas in the winter and remains wary of offensive military operations owing to its historic scar of militarism. French President Emmanuel Macron faces reelection in April, and is using the crisis to push for a more aggressive European Union role that might weaken US authority. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is mired in boozy scandals and struggling to cling onto power. The government in London is also locked in a bitter estrangement with its near allies over its exit from the EU.\n\nBiden made a public point of addressing divides in Europe on Monday, gathering leaders in a video call and orchestrating a series of statements on both sides of the Atlantic promising unity on the crisis and the costs that Russia could face.\n\n“I had a very, very, very good meeting – total unanimity with all the European leaders,” Biden told reporters afterward.\n\nBut there’s reason to doubt his confidence. The European Union, for example, saw no need to follow the US in authorizing the departure of nonessential staff and family members from Kyiv. Officials on the other side of the Atlantic have not used the same kind of alarmist language as the Biden administration about the imminent threat of a Russian invasion.\n\nThe European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Monday that though unity and pressure on Russia was vital, the situation was not irretrievable.\n\n“Certainly, I have reason to be concerned but I don’t want to go in a nervous attack,” Borrell told Hala Gorani on CNN International.\n\nManaging different threat perceptions with Europe is just one of the challenges that Biden faces in navigating the Ukraine showdown, one of the most testing moments in the recent history of NATO.\n\nAnd he knows that even if he can engineer a peaceful resolution, China, North Korea and Iran are up next, posing more intractable challenges for a presidency never free from crises.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/trump-presidential-bid-analysis/index.html", "title": "As he launches presidential bid, Trump offers a dark vision voters ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s American carnage, round three.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump on Tuesday dragged Americans back into his dystopian worldview of a failing nation scarred by crime-ridden cities turned into “cesspools of blood,” and swamped by immigrants. He added a scary new twist at a time of global tensions, claiming the country was on the verge of tumbling into nuclear war.\n\nLaunching his bid for a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, Trump conversely painted his own turbulent single term, which ended in his attempt to destroy democracy and a mismanaged pandemic, as a “golden age” of prosperity and American global dominance.\n\nThe new Trump – for the 2024 campaign – is the same as the old Trump.\n\nHe pounded out a message of American decline, highlighted raging inflation and slammed President Joe Biden as aged, weak, and disrespected by US enemies, while highlighting his own chummy ties with global dictators, like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who seek to weaken American power.\n\nWhen the 76-year-old former property tycoon, reality star and commander in chief promised a new “quest to save our country,” he encapsulated the challenges that his new campaign poses for his own party and the rest of the United States.\n\nTo begin with, in the gold-leafed ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump steered clear of the election denialism that helped doom multiple Republican nominees in the midterm elections and that has inspired skepticism of his viability among GOP lawmakers in Washington.\n\nBut as usual, his self-discipline didn’t hold, as he descended further into his personal obsessions the longer he went on, portraying himself as a “victim,” raising new suspicion about the US election system and slamming ongoing criminal probes against him as politicized and deeply unfair. The speech lacked the riotous nature and energy of his campaign rallies. But Trump’s material was a familiar rhetorical cocktail of grievance certain to enthuse his base supporters.\n\nHowever, it may have come across to many of the swing voters in the states that he lost in 2020 as authoritarian demagoguery. Many of those voters deserted Republicans yet again last week, as the party failed to win back the Senate and as it still waits to confirm it will win only a slim majority in the House. Many GOP lawmakers squarely blame the lack of a red wave on Trump – for foisting extreme, election-denying candidates on the party in key states. That’s why there is increasing interest in potential alternative candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who roared to reelection last week, and has recently proved, unlike Trump, that he can build a broad coalition with Trump-style policies but without the chaos epitomized by the 45th president.\n\nAnd yet by launching his campaign so early – before the 2022 election is even finalized – the ex-president is seeking to freeze the GOP field. And there is so far no evidence that his devoted supporters will desert him.\n\nWhat could be the opening acts of a new election clash between Trump and Biden unfolded over multiple time zones. As Trump was speaking, the current president – who confounded historic expectations of a midterm election drubbing – was at another beach resort, in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nBiden spent the moments leading up to Trump’s speech huddled with other world leaders seeking a united response to a possibly alarming escalation in the war in Ukraine after an explosion on the territory of NATO ally Poland. There was some irony to the fact that Biden was leading the same Western alliance at a moment of peril that Trump frequently had undermined while in office. (Biden said after a day of rising global tensions that first indications were that the missile that fell onto a Polish farm, killing two people, did not originate in Russia.)\n\nEpitomizing the gulf between a president’s duties and the frivolity of the campaign trail, Biden, when asked if he had a comment on Trump’s launch, replied: “No, not really.”\n\nTrump seeks a historic comeback under the threat of criminal probes\n\nTrump referred briefly to the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago for his hoard of highly classified documents and subpoenas sent to his family members. It was a reminder that his campaign raises the extraordinary scenario of a candidate for president running for a new term while facing multiple criminal investigations and the possibility of indictment by the Justice Department. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, is being investigated over the classified documents, the run-up to the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, and in Georgia over his attempt to steal Biden’s win in the crucial swing state in 2020.\n\nTrump has already claimed that he is being persecuted because Biden wants to stop him from becoming president again – an accusation likely to be embraced by his millions of supporters. Thus, the clash between his campaign and various investigations into his conduct promises to inflict even more damage on political and legal institutions that he kept under continuous assault as president.\n\nOne thing noticeably missing from Trump’s speech was acknowledgment of his unprecedented attempt to interrupt 250 years of peaceful transfers of power between presidents. But the Capitol insurrection is an indelible stain that is sure to haunt his campaign. CNN has exclusively reported that top DOJ officials have considered whether a special counsel would be needed during the Trump campaign to avoid potential political conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump is trying to pull off a historic feat accomplished by only one previous president – Grover Cleveland, who became the only commander in chief to serve nonconsecutive terms after he won a return to the White House in 1892.\n\nA Trump victory in 2024 would represent a stunning rebound given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice – once for trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden, and secondly for inciting the mob attack on the Capitol, one of the most flagrant assaults ever on US democracy.\n\nA test for the GOP\n\nA return to the Oval Office for Trump would stun the world. His record of disdaining US allies and coddling dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un fractured decades of US foreign policy and made the United States – long a force for stability in the world – into one of its most erratic powers.\n\nTrump left office in disgrace in 2021, after the assault on the Capitol, not even bothering to attend the inauguration of his successor and insisting ever since that the election was corrupt – despite no evidence and against the findings of multiple courts and his own Justice Department.\n\nEver since, the ex-president has made his lies about the 2020 election the centerpiece of a political movement that still has millions of followers – as was seen with the primary victories of some of his handpicked candidates in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nBut many Trump-backed candidates failed to win competitive general elections. And Trump’s 2024 campaign will test whether there are Republicans who, while they may be drawn in by Trump’s bulldozing style and populist, nationalist instincts, will tire of the drama and chaos that surround him. It will also pose a question of whether a new generation of Republicans, who have tapped into his political base and the “America first” principles of Trumpism – like DeSantis, for example – are ready to challenge the movement’s still wildly popular founder.\n\nTrump was already rejected by a broad general election audience once – he lost by more than 7 million votes in 2020. The same pattern appeared to exert itself as the GOP fell short of expectations in the midterms, which ironically will give Trump-aligned lawmakers strong leverage in what’s likely to be a narrow House Republican majority.\n\nAnd even if he secures the nomination again, it’s an open question whether he’ll be able to recreate his 2016 winning coalition after alienating moderate and suburban voters or whether a combination of motivated base voters and previously disaffected Republicans returning to the fold will be able to make up the difference.\n\nA norm-busting first term\n\nTrump’s first term between 2017 and 2021 was one of the most tumultuous periods in American political history.\n\nHe shattered the traditions and restraints of his office, subjecting political institutions – designed by the Founders to guard against exactly his brand of autocratic egotism – to their ultimate test.\n\nThe 45th president’s reputation was also stained by his negligent denial and mismanagement of a once-in-100-years pandemic. He skipped over his failed leadership in the emergency during his speech on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump’s flouting of science and public health guidelines came back to haunt him as he contracted Covid-19 in the fall of 2020. He survived a serious bout with the help of experimental drugs before theatrically ripping off his mask in a White House photo op when he returned from the hospital.\n\nOne important aspect of his pandemic strategy was a success, however. An early White House bet to invest big in vaccine development by private firms and scientists, under the title of Operation Warp Speed, put the US in better position than many other industrialized nations.\n\nThe coronavirus destroyed the roaring economy Trump had hoped to ride to reelection, leaving as his most important achievement the shaping of a conservative Supreme Court majority, which has already dramatically altered American society with its overturning of Roe v. Wade and could last a generation.\n\nBut history will most remember him for his two impeachments, both following abuses of power designed to manipulate the free and fair elections that are at the root of America’s democratic system in order to prolong his tenure in office.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the insurrection has uncovered damning evidence in Trump’s inner circle about his behavior in the run-up to January 6 and during the insurrection. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for instance, testified that chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump thought Vice President Mike Pence deserved the calls for him to be hanged by insurrectionists. There was also evidence of Trump’s vicious pressure on local officials and election workers in states such as Georgia.\n\nYet there remain questions about whether the committee will be able to hold accountable a man who has always dodged responsibility in a wild and whirling life in business, reality television and politics.\n\nEven if the committee advises the Justice Department that prosecuting Trump is merited, it’s unknown whether the evidence it has collected would be sufficient to secure a conviction. And Attorney General Merrick Garland would be faced with a massive dilemma given the extraordinary implications of bringing criminal charges against an active presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/06/donald-trump-world-reaction/76087198007/", "title": "Trump's returning to the White House.

He will end that \"in a day.\" And he will, he says, bring peace to the Middle East, too.\n\nNevertheless, the immediate reaction to former President Donald Trump's election victory Wednesday was that Iran's currency hit an all-time low against the dollar. There was no rush to praise him by American adversaries such as Russia or North Korea. In Gaza, Hamas said it still intends to take the fight to Israel.\n\nYet news of Trump's impending return to the White House did see leaders and allies unleash a wave of warm wishes and congratulations − and what appeared to be a little polite nudging − in the direction of a future U.S. president who in his first term was regarded by many as a turbulent and unpredictable figure on the world stage.\n\nMany of these good wishes arrived even before most media outlets called his win.\n\nHow Trump won the White House (again): How Trump won the White House (again): These key issues propelled election win\n\nHow Kamala Harris lost: How Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump claimed El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele wasn't doing such a \"wonderful job\" on preventing immigration to the U.S. and was sending his country's \"murderers\" over the border. Bukele early Wednesday nevertheless appeared to be the first world leader to welcome a new Trump presidency.\n\n\"May God bless and guide you,\" Bukele said in what seemed to be a veiled reference to their spat.\n\nSlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who was nearly assassinated in May, said Trump's victory was a \"defeat of liberal and progressive ideas.\" The election was, he added, a confirmation to \"never trust the media and polls.\"\n\nThere was also praise for Trump from Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban who mirrored some of Trump's own signature phrasing in a Facebook post by talking about his \"beautiful victory.\"\n\nItaly's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said Trump’s victory was a win for \"patriotism, border control, tax cuts, Christian roots, freedom of speech (and a) commitment to world peace.\" British lawmaker and Brexit provocateur Nigel Farage said in a text message Trump's win was a \"great result for the world. He is a genuine friend of the U.K.\"\n\nWhat does Trump's victory mean for Ukraine?\n\nBeyond off-the-cuff remarks, Trump hasn't fully articulated his foreign policy.\n\nHe hasn't, for example, specified how he could settle the war between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBut Ukraine has been watching the vote closely to see what the outcome could mean for American support for its attempt to beat back Russia's invasion. The president-elect and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, have both cast doubt on their commitment to give Kyiv more arms and financing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released a flattering statement Wednesday that appeared to acknowledge some of the unease now being felt in his country.\n\n\"I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" Zelensky said. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.\"\n\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ending conflict in Ukraine overnight was \"impossible.\"\n\n\"I’m sure many European leaders will tell themselves in the coming weeks that they can win Trump over, sweet talk him, pump up his inflated ego, etc etc.,\" wrote Phillips P. O'Brien, a professor of strategic security studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, in his Ukraine-focused newsletter on Wednesday.\n\n\"Maybe they can − but also maybe they can’t. And this is the rub.\"\n\nTrump beats Harris. Now what for the world?\n\nWhen Trump last occupied the White House from 2017 to 2021, serving and former international officials and foreign affairs experts from Berlin to Sydney routinely accused him of slashing and burning his way through global agreements and commitments on climate change, trade, overseas troop deployments, public health, nuclear weapons and more.\n\nTrump roiled U.S. foreign partners with his inflammatory language and disregard for diplomatic protocol. This included repeated threats to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, widely considered the bedrock of transatlantic security for 75 years.\n\n\"There will definitely be anxiety in many European capitals this morning as they wake up to the news Trump is back,\" said Michael Martins, the founder of London-based Overton Advisory, a political consultancy. \"Although some will think four years is a short time that they can wait out, the reality is that Trump's foreign and trade policies are much more well defined now and his team are experienced enough to execute it quickly.\"\n\n'Dismay and disbelief': What US allies said about the chance of another Trump presidency\n\nBacking from Trump may be something Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is counting on as he weathers intensifying domestic and international pressure to end a war in Gaza that has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, without leading to the return of all of Israel's hostages. As Americans were voting Tuesday, Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, triggering protests across Israel.\n\nMore than a year of frustrated American diplomatic pressure aimed at getting Netanyahu to curb Israel's destruction and high death toll in Gaza and allow in more humanitarian has failed. Netanyahu has long touted his close relationship with Trump and Israel's leader appears to believe that his win is good for Israel.\n\n\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a huge victory!\"\n\n'Maximum pressure': World reacts to Trump win\n\nIn his first term, Trump used what his administration called a \"maximum pressure\" policy to try to force Iran, mostly though economic sanctions, to abandon its nuclear program. He also pulled the U.S. out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that independent nuclear monitors said was largely working.\n\nThe Biden administration has not re-entered that agreement and U.S.-Iran relations have spiraled as Tehran and militant groups it backs such as Hamas and Hezbollah have became further entangled in fighting U.S. ally Israel after Hamas invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7 last year, killing 1,200 people and taking hostages back to Gaza.\n\nA spokesperson for Iran's diplomatic mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment on Trump's election win and what it could mean. The two countries that narrowly avoided a war in Trump's first term after Trump ordered the assassination of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general in an air strike on Baghdad airport.\n\nElsewhere, there are signs Trump could seek to threaten adversaries and allies alike, for different reasons.\n\nIn fact, he already has.\n\nAndrew Law, the founder The Mexico Brief, a news and analysis platform, described Trump's election as a \"sobering and uncertain moment for Mexico.\" He said Mexico’s most crucial relationship is with the U.S. and that recently elected President Claudia Sheinbaum will probably intensify efforts to halt migrants heading to the U.S. from their shared border, not least because Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on Mexico if she doesn't.\n\nLaw said Mexico just about \"weathered\" Trump's first term. His second one may be just as challenging for the U.S.'s southern neighbor. Trump has said Sheinbaum will be the first world leader he calls when taking office.\n\nIn Europe, Peter Beyer, a conservative German lawmaker who is a member of that country's parliamentary foreign relations committee, said he expected a fresh Trump administration − Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2025 − to \"deliver\" on an agenda that will push for more NATO-member defense spending and \"heavy\" trade protectionism.\n\nTrump has floated the idea of imposing tariffs of 10% or 20% on all goods imported into the U.S. and even higher tariffs of 60% or more on Chinese-made products.\n\n\"Trump 2.0,\" said Beyer, will be \"quicker and dirtier\" on trade and NATO.\n\nIn China, Henry Huiyao Wang, a former senior adviser to China's government and the founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, appeared to agree with that assessment.\n\n\"If he selects a hawkish team to dominate U.S. policy, his administration likely will not only force Chinese enterprises to reduce exports to the U.S. but may also reduce non-governmental contacts between the two countries, such as educational and academic exchanges, thus impacting public perceptions on both sides.\"\n\nWang said he expected to Trump to adopt \"pragmatic attitude\" toward Taiwan, the self-governing island territory that Beijing views as part of China, and has vowed to reunite with the mainland − and that the U.S. had pledged to defend.\n\n'America strong at home and abroad'\n\nDaniel DePetris, a foreign affairs fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said it's \"very hard to predict the policies of a man who values unpredictability.\"\n\n\"The general assumption is Trump 2.0 will be far less restrained this time around,\" said DePetris.\n\n\"Foreign governments, allies and adversaries alike, will certainly be planning for the worst. But the worst was anticipated when Trump first won in 2016 and his term, despite the rhetoric and sloppy policy process, was actually more rooted in the status-quo than one might expect,\" he said.\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling center-left Labour Party are not natural Trump allies.\n\nBut Starmer said he looked forward to working with Trump. \"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.\"\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was more direct.\n\nRosy outlook: What Boris Johnson thinks about a Trump election win\n\n\"Huge congratulations to Donald Trump on his amazing victory. I have no doubt he will now set about making America strong at home and abroad,\" he said.\n\nA few hours after those statements were released British police arrested two men − environmental activists − who sprayed orange paint on a section of the U.S. embassy building in London, an apparent protest at Trump's victory.\n\nBreaking down the election results: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter for updates and exclusive analysis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-russia-republicans/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Joe Biden cranks up pressure as Vladimir Putin mulls ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Western allies are signaling a stiffened stance in the showdown with Russia, piling on pressure designed to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine in a strategy that nevertheless risks quickening a dangerous cycle of escalation.\n\nThe White House pivot comes with Biden now under searing pressure from Republicans to show more strength in the confrontation and follows a week in which he was heavily criticized for hastily walked-back comments that played into the Russian leader’s hopes of dividing NATO.\n\nSeveral Republicans accused the President of showing weakness and appeasing Putin in talk show appearances on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a jarring tone by describing the Kremlin strongman as a “very talented statesman” who knew how to use power. GOP critiques of Biden ignored the party’s tolerance of ex-President Donald Trump’s craven deference to the Russian leader and some came across as an attempt to use a national security crisis to damage Biden politically ahead of midterm elections in 2022 and the 2024 presidential election.\n\nA series of moves, comments and signals from Washington and Europe over the weekend underscored the deepening peril of the situation at a time when there appears little meaningful diplomatic activity to stop its rapid deterioration.\n\nThe State Department said Sunday it was authorizing the departure of non-essential staff and family members from its embassy in Kyiv and warned that in the event of a Russian invasion its capacity to help Americans in the country would be limited. In another significant development, administration officials said the President had discussed options that include deploying between 1,000 and 5,000 troops plus aircraft and ships to US allies in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe.\n\nNATO said early Monday that several member states, including France, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands were either sending or considering small deployments of ships and aircraft to the Baltic and eastern European states. The mostly symbolic maneuvers appear calibrated to send a signal of resolve to Putin while avoiding the impression of a larger-scale mobilization that could send tensions spiraling out of control.\n\n“We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense,” alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that if a single Russian unit entered Ukraine it “would trigger a swift, a severe and a united response” from the US and Europe.\n\nBritain, meanwhile, warned that it had intelligence that Putin was trying to install a puppet leader in place of the democratically elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And the head of Germany’s navy was forced to resign after comments sympathetic to Russia in a drama that suggested an effort to cover-up deep divisions within the West about how to handle Putin.\n\nA potential US tactical shift\n\nUntil now, the US has concentrated on sketching the dire consequences, in the form of debilitating sanctions, that it says would effectively cut Russia off from the Western economy in the event of an invasion. But the latest tactical decisions darkened an already foreboding atmosphere after Biden said last week that he believed that the decision on whether to invade Ukraine was Putin’s dilemma alone. Talk of deploying troops also came across as a direct challenge to the Russian leader while at the same time being apparently designed to protect Biden’s political flank at home.\n\nWhile the State Department said that it was acting out of an abundance of caution, drawing down embassy staffing is also a classic act of diplomatic symbolism that denotes a worsening crisis. Officials said any move to reinforce NATO flanks would be intended to “provide deterrence and reassurance to allies.” It was not immediately clear whether deployments would come before or after any Russian invasion of Ukraine. But even talking about such steps puts Putin on notice that the entire premise of his hostage hold on Ukraine – to force NATO to withdraw forces from ex-Soviet states – would backfire.\n\nYet the increasingly robust Western gambit is also a risk. It could convince Putin that he is right to warn that Russian security is threatened by the West. At the very least it could give him a propaganda pretext to invade Ukraine. And Biden must consider whether high-profile troop deployments before an invasion that the US says could come at any time could make it even harder for Putin to back down without securing a tangible payoff for his troop buildup.\n\nThe latest US signals came after Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders and initiated a new deployment of forces to Belarus, further surrounding its former Soviet client state, and after the government in Kyiv said that Moscow would soon have enough forces for a full-scale invasion. But Biden’s latest steps will not satisfy Republicans who have demanded a much more aggressive US mobilization and are using the crisis to portray Biden as a feckless leader.\n\nTop Republican: ‘Weakness invites aggression’\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday urged the White House to use sanctions against Russia before any invasion as requested by the government of Ukraine.\n\n“If we don’t do something strong right now, I’m afraid that he’s going to invade Ukraine, which will have global ramifications here,” the Texas Republican said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nBut Blinken rejected such an approach, warning that it would diminish the chances that concerns about consequences could influence Putin’s decision. “When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression,” Blinken said on “State of the Union.” “And so, if they’re triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect.”\n\nMcCaul also laid into Biden over the administration’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, saying that it had convinced the Russian leader that the United States would not stand up for its interests.\n\n“I think this all started … with Afghanistan, and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness. Weakness invited aggression,” McCaul said on CBS. “We’re seen as weak right now … because of President Biden.” (The administration argues the evacuation from Afghanistan was a huge success, but the initial debacle shocked US allies, left some to question the US’ global commitment and helped hammer the President’s approval ratings). The administration counters GOP criticism by saying that an agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban gave it no choice but to leave the country.\n\nPompeo insisted on Fox that the previous administration had won Putin’s respect by being strong, the result being that he “didn’t use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO.” It’s true that some members of the Western alliance did increase military spending after Trump’s complaints about the US being ripped off by its allies – though perceptions of a rising Russian threat and his antipathy to the idea of defending allies also contributed. And the ex-President did allow lethal US aid to be sent to Ukraine, unlike former President Barack Obama. But his desire for Putin’s approval often seemed to undermine his own administration’s policy. His withdrawal from Syria, constant berating of NATO allies and denial of Russian election meddling advanced Putin’s foreign policy goals.\n\nPompeo: We should ‘respect’ Putin\n\nBut Pompeo also offered gushing praise of the Russian leader’s intellect that seemed tonally odd given that he’s a US adversary currently threatening an armed takeover of a democracy supported by Washington.\n\n“We had respect for him and his power. He’s a very talented statesman,” Pompeo said on Fox. “He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness’ sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that.”\n\nThe idea that the United States should respect a leader who rules with an iron fist, who crushed democracy and freedom of the press, imprisons political opponents and presides over a corrupt economy that empowers oligarchs is notable coming from an ex-secretary of state.\n\nForeign policy experts often divide on the question of whether Putin is playing a tough hand with aplomb or whether his international gangsterism is more the act of a weak leader terrified of legitimate opposition and being forced from power. It’s also questionable whether massing troops on the border of a vulnerable democracy and making outlandish demands of NATO is the behavior of a “talented statesman.”\n\nAnd any arguments that Putin was cowed by Trump from using coercion against the West are confounded by US intelligence assessments that Moscow interfered in US elections. The then-President stunned the US espionage community by disowning assessments of Putin’s 2016 meddling when he appeared side-by-side with him at a press conference in Helsinki. Cyberattacks emanating from Russian soil also took place throughout the Trump presidency, including the SolarWinds operation that breached US federal agencies when the former President was in power. Supposed respect for the US didn’t stop Russian agents using a biological weapon on British soil to poison a defector, according to the UK government.\n\nThe willingness of the GOP to criticize Biden, despite these huge blemishes on Trump’s record, shows that for many of its members, with a few exceptions like McCaul, politics take priority over national security in the pursuit of future power. Such an approach only widens the divides on which Putin relies as he seeks to tarnish American prestige.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/biden-macron-state-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden and Macron affirm commitment to Ukraine but diverge on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday demonstrated a united front in addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine but offered divergent answers over their willingness to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relaying that they spent much their recent meeting discussing the invasion.\n\nBiden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with Macron that he “has no immediate plans” to contact Putin, but added that he’s prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he’s looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees. New Orleans native Jon Batiste is performing musical selections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris welcomed President Macron to NASA to celebrate the cooperation of both nations in space. The first family also held a private dinner with the Macrons ahead of Thursday’s formal state dinner.\n\nDuring the last leg of their US visit, the Macrons will travel to New Orleans on Friday to highlight new efforts to expand French language education in the US.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Betsy Klein Sam Fossum", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/sotu-biden-2022/index.html", "title": "'Now is our moment': Biden confronts Putin and tries to kickstart his ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden closed his first State of the Union address Tuesday night with a resounding sense of optimism and unity as the world watches Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying his confidence in the American people is what gives him assurance that democracy will prevail at this critical moment.\n\n“Now is the hour, our moment of responsibility. Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged,” Biden said in closing.\n\n“Well, I know this nation. We will meet the test. To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. We will save democracy. As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life,” he continued.\n\nThe President said, “The state of the union is strong, because you, the American people, are strong.”\n\n“We are stronger today than we were a year ago,” Biden said. “And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. Now is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. And we will, as one people. One America. The United States of America.”\n\nSpeaking to political leaders in Washington, Biden began the address by underscoring unity against Russia within the US and among its allies.\n\nAmid such a crucial time for global politics, Biden sent a message to the world: The West is united in its response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and condemns the Russian leader for his aggression. And he also encouraged all in the chamber to show that support with a resounding standing ovation and said the US and its allies have “an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.”\n\nBiden argued that Putin’s aggression had only made the world’s democracies strengthen their resolve to counter rising autocracies.\n\n“Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated,” Biden said. “He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.”\n\nThe President also boasted of the West’s unanimity in the face of Russia’s aggression, saying their united front is “inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine” and “choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.”\n\n“Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated, repeated, efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and in this nation. Putin was wrong. We were ready,” Biden said.\n\n“We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression. We countered Russia’s lies with truth. And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.”\n\nThe President celebrated the impact actions will have on “Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.”\n\n“We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” he said.\n\nHe also asserted that “Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.”\n\nPutin, for his part, was not expected to watch the speech, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “The President usually does not watch TV addresses,” Peskov said in response to a question from CNN.\n\nAs Tuesday unfolded ahead of Biden’s primetime speech, the President, his administration and its allies have made it clear that Ukraine has been top of mind.\n\nThe US and its allies announced early Tuesday that they have agreed to a release of 60 million barrels from their reserves, the White House and International Energy Agency, as leaders seek to dampen the effect of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on gas prices at home. Vice President Kamala Harris held five separate calls with European leaders and Biden held a half-hour call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBiden acknowledged that many Americans are worried about how gas prices are being affected by the war.\n\n“I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. But I want you to know that we are going to be OK,” he said. “When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.”\n\nA return to domestic concerns\n\nThrough the remainder of his speech Biden delivered a more traditional State of the Union address – pitching his domestic agenda to the American people for the upcoming year and calling on Congress to approve a number of his proposals which have stalled despite Democrats’ control of both chambers.\n\nHe tried to highlight areas of bipartisan unity across a number of policy issues, and in the context of the pandemic and the state of the economy – two of the largest issues on Americans’ minds – the President sought to relay a sense of empathy and understanding.\n\nThe President used the speech to celebrate last year’s passage of his first two major legislative agenda items, the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law, as well as their effects on Americans. In addition, he repeatedly called on the audience of lawmakers in the room to move on his stalled priorities, such as passing the laundry list of items from the Build Back Better social spending bill and confirming his Federal Reserve nominees.\n\nBiden outlined his plan to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, calling for a bipartisan “reset” from the polarization of the last two years as the nation begins the return to normal.\n\nHe acknowledged that Americans are “tired, frustrated, and exhausted” with the pandemic, highlighting the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recently updated mask guidelines, which show that “most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free,” and outlining steps the US will take to “move forward safely.”\n\n“Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, Covid-19 need no longer control our lives,” he added. “I know some are talking about ‘living with Covid-19.’ Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with Covid-19. We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.”\n\nIn another area that has affected everyday life, the President sought to recalibrate his economic message to acknowledge the hardships many Americans are facing, saying, “The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. I understand.”\n\n“(W)ith all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills,” Biden said. “Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.”\n\nIn remarks meant to address a concern of Americans across the nation, Biden said his plan to fight inflation would include investing in jobs at home, allowing Americans to get back to work while also making more of the products needed domestically.\n\n“Lower your costs, not your wages. Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America,” Biden said. “Economists call it ‘increasing the productive capacity of our economy.’ I call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.”\n\nThe President revealed what he called “a Unity Agenda for the Nation” – a broad-sweeping list of efforts with four main points: beat the opioid pandemic, take on mental health, support veterans and end cancer.\n\nBiden announced new efforts to combat identity theft and criminal fraud in pandemic relief programs, including the appointment of a Justice Department prosecutor tasked with identifying and prosecuting pandemic fraud. He’ll also announce higher penalties and more resources to prosecute fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Unemployment Insurance (UI). Biden, the White House says, will sign an executive order in the coming weeks tasking federal agencies to address fraud and theft in their respective purviews.\n\nBiden highlighted efforts his administration has taken to reduce gun violence, reiterate his call on Congress to pass “common-sense gun violence legislation that will save lives,” and urge Congress to pass his proposed budget, which includes hundreds of millions in funding for community violence intervention programs and community policing, according to a White House official.\n\nDespite the President’s efforts to unify Americans in his speech, the night was not without politically contentious moments.\n\nSeveral Republicans boycotted the speech over a Covid testing requirement. As Biden was discussing the border and immigration, at least one person in the chamber was heard chanting, “Build the wall.” And as he paid tribute to members of the armed forces who were sickened by burn pits, Biden was interrupted by Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who audibly interrupted, “You put them there – 13 of them” – an apparent reference to soldiers killed during the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. She was quickly shushed by lawmakers.\n\nAs is tradition, first lady Jill Biden has invited guests that represent policies and themes the President will talk about during the speech, her office said. This year’s invitations included Ukraine Ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova, along with educators, a union representative, members of the tech community, an organizer of Native American causes, a health care worker and a military spouse have also been invited to sit with the first lady in her box above the dais.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was the designated survivor for Tuesday’s address, meaning she was the member of the Cabinet assigned to remain outside the House chamber during the State of the Union in case disaster strikes.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}]}

All but five cases were in unvaccinated people or people with unknown vaccination status, and most (107) occurred in far West Texas in Gaines County, which had a 13.6% rate of non-medical vaccine exemptions in K-12 students, according to 2023-2024 state data.\n\nTwenty-two people have been hospitalized as of Tuesday and one, an unvaccinated child, has died.\n\nIn New Mexico, the number has held steady at nine, according to the New Mexico Department of Health on Tuesday, all in Lea County, which is just across from the Texas state line and Gaines County. Four of those infected were under the age of 18 and unvaccinated, while the other five were adults, also unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia officials confirmed to USA TODAY Tuesday that the state still had three confirmed cases.

According to the World Health Organization, it infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body.\n\nThe virus is one of the most contagious infectious diseases to exist; so contagious, in fact, that 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed end up contracting it. Additionally, one in five of those people end up hospitalized, according to the CDC.\n\nMeasles is spread through contact with infected nasal or throat secretions, according to the WHO. It is airborne and most commonly spread through actions like coughing, sneezing or breathing. The measles virus can remain contagious in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of measles?\n\nAccording to the CDC, measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and typically include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Measles rash appears three to five days after the onset of the first symptoms.\n\nOther signs and symptoms of measles include:\n\nWhen the rash appears, a person’s fever may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nHigh fever\n\nCough\n\nRunny nose and sneezing\n\nRed, watery eyes\n\nLoss of appetite, diarrhea\n\nReddish-brown rash that can spread across the entire body\n\nKoplik spots, tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin\n\nSmall raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots (the spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the rest of the body)\n\nRFK Jr. urges parents to consider measles vaccine\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's top health official, asked parents to consider measles vaccinations for their children but did not outright suggest them.\n\nReferring to the deadly outbreak as a \"call to action,\" Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece published Sunday on Fox News Digital that parents should consult with physicians about the MMR vaccine, which also covers mumps and rubella.\n\nDespite RFK Jr. saying he isn't anti-vaccine during confirmation hearings, he has in the past falsely linked vaccines to autism and urged parents to not vaccinate their children. Though the current outbreak resulted in the first measles death in a decade, RFK initially called the surge in cases \"not unusual.”\n\n\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" Kennedy wrote. \"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\"\n\nContributing: Janet Loehrke, Eduardo Cuevas, Fernando Cervantes Jr., USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/26/first-death-reported-in-measles-outbreak-in-texas-new-mexico/80498646007/", "title": "First death reported in measles outbreak in Texas, New Mexico", "text": "AI-assisted summary New Mexico lawmakers urged the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to take action against a measles outbreak affecting the state and Texas.\n\nThe outbreak has led to one confirmed death and over 120 cases in Texas, with most cases being children.\n\nNew Mexico has reported nine cases, prompting calls for increased vaccination efforts and public health measures.\n\nThe lawmakers emphasized the importance of the measles vaccine and maintaining CDC recommendations for vaccination.\n\nNew Mexico's Congressional delegation asked U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F.

New state health data show two more cases in Broward County, of a child younger than 5 and another between ages 5 and 9.\n\nThe newly reported infections bring the total to eight, just days after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo contradicted federal and medical professional guidance to contain the spread of the highly contagious and preventable disease that's resurging globally and in the U.S. Florida is one of 11 states that have seen cases this year.\n\nIt's unclear if Florida's two new cases are connected to the school outbreak. Broward County Public Schools haven’t identified new cases since Tuesday, when there were six, district spokesperson John Sullivan said.\n\nThe state Department of Health said there was no additional information at this time.\n\nMeasles outbreak in Florida grows: What to know about virus flare-ups across the US\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, Ladapo said Manatee Bay parents and guardians could decide whether to send their children back to school, a statement that conflicted with federal and medical professional recommendations that children from the school should remain at home to prevent the spread of measles. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that unvaccinated children exposed to measles be isolated for three weeks. Ladapo appeared to agree with this assessment before he concluded that children’s attendance was up to parents or guardians because of the “high immunity rate” and the burden of healthy children missing school, but he said the state's recommendation could change.\n\nHealth experts are concerned by his lax attitude.\n\n“This is a state surgeon general saying that he is not going to enforce any of the tenets of public health in the name of freedom,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which has worked to contain a recent measles outbreak among children in the Pennsylvania city. “He wants freedom at the expense of putting children in harm’s way.”\n\nThe only freedom Ladapo is upholding is the \"freedom to harm,\" Offit said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis tapped Ladapo to be surgeon general in 2021, in part because of his vocal opposition COVID-19 vaccine mandates and school closures. Last month, Ladapo said the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines pose health risks, defying federal approvals and scientific consensus.\n\nWith the measles outbreak, Ladapo again stands apart. Experts say that isolation and vaccination are the best way to stop the spread.\n\n“This is a vaccine-preventable disease,” Dr. Thresia Gambon, president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told USA TODAY. “There are very strict guidelines as to what to do in an outbreak in order to contain it quickly.”\n\nGambon’s organization, which represents pediatricians in the state, supports CDC’s recommendation that children at the school should have been told to isolate.\n\nMeasles map: See where measles cases are being reported across the US\n\nMeasles can come with serious risk. About 1 in 5 children who become ill end up in the hospital, the CDC said. And 1 in 1,000 can develop encephalitis, or brain swelling that can have neurological effects. Between one and three children in a thousand will die.\n\nA full-dose regimen of the vaccine is about 98% effective against measles. About 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with the virus will get it. Measles can be transmitted without physical contact. A person can catch it from droplets lingering in the air or on surfaces.\n\nAt Manatee Bay Elementary, 33 of the school's 1,067 students don’t have the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, said Sullivan, of Broward County Schools. That means about 97% have been given some percentage of their measles vaccine. Sullivan declined to say whether the six students who contracted measles had previously been vaccinated, citing privacy concerns.\n\nLess than 92% of Broward County kindergartners had been immunized as of 2022, in line with state figures. This is below national averages, which have shown declines in recent years, and the U.S. goal of 95% coverage with the measles vaccine.\n\nIn the meantime, parents at Manatee Bay have pulled their children out of school. On Tuesday, 219 students did not attend class in person, Sullivan said. By Friday, some had returned and 159 students remained at home.\n\nIn January, the CDC warned health providers they needed to do more to detect a potential measles spread in their communities amid a global rise in cases. The lack of large U.S. outbreaks so far signals there is still good immunization against measles through vaccines, said Dr. William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's International Vaccine Access Center.\n\nBut outbreaks could worsen in the right circumstances, Moss said, if enough unvaccinated children are exposed to the virus and they spread measles into a community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/03/06/texas-measles-outbreak-vaccines/81612632007/", "title": "Texas measles outbreak: Young doctor quickly becomes' nation's ...", "text": "Dr. Leila Myrick had only read about measles in medical school before a girl with the telltale rash turned up in her West Texas emergency room in late January.\n\nThe child, who had no immunity to the highly contagious disease but had an underlying respiratory condition, would become one of the first known cases in Gaines County, the epicenter of the nation’s largest outbreak, in six years. Nearly 160 known people have been infected since, including 22 people who have been hospitalized. And last week, a school-aged child with no underlying conditions died, marking the first measles death in a decade. The outbreak spread across rural counties and is now suspected to have caused an outbreak nearby in New Mexico.\n\nMyrick, a 38-year-old family medicine and obstetrics physician in the tiny town of Seminole, looked back to medical texts to learn more about the disease, once thought to be nearing eradication in the U.S. Now, she's treated nearly a dozen cases and counting. In just over a month’s time, the rural doctor has become one of the nation's only doctors with firsthand experience of how infectious, and serious, measles is. And she is an unwitting expert in a disease she never thought she'd treat.\n\n“Now we’re literally seeing when you don’t vaccinate, this is what happens,” Myrick said.\n\nSince vaccination rates have dropped across the U.S., doctors and health staff across the country are rethinking preventable diseases such as measles that hadn't been seen in generations.\n\nThe U.S. declared measles eliminated in 2000. But American immunization rates have decreased in schools — which normally require vaccines for attendance — below the 95% herd immunity threshold needed to prevent outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drops have been attributed to distrust and misinformation around public health and vaccination that led to increases in medical or religious exemptions.\n\n“Measles is the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the infectious diseases division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School. “There are other vaccine-preventable illness that we could see recurring, which could also have catastrophic consequences.”\n\nIn Gaines County, just over 80% kindergartners were vaccinated against measles last school year. In the county, Loop Independent School District, with about 150 students, had less than half of students vaccinated.\n\nAs of Tuesday, over 100 of Texas' 159 cases were in Gaines County. Most cases are in children, predominantly among those who are school-aged. All but five cases were among people who weren't vaccinated or had no known vaccination status.\n\nFrom Atlanta to rural health\n\nFive years ago, Myrick moved from her hometown of Atlanta — after studying at Emory School of Medicine and earning a doctorate in neuroscience in addition to her medical degree — to Seminole, where peanuts, oil, natural gas and cotton dominate the Texas plains. Instead of Atlanta’s famed research institutions, including CDC headquarters, Myrick sought to practice treating families as a rural doctor. She moved her family to Seminole, population 7,231, where she liked the diversity. It is a mix of white, Mexican and Mennonite families and sits about 80 miles southwest of Lubbock.\n\nShe and her husband are raising two children, ages 5 and 8, who attend local schools. Her in-laws live across the street. Seminole is like a village, she said. People look out for each other and their children.\n\nHer commute to work is a 3-minute drive with one traffic light − short enough that she doesn't even bother to turn on the radio. At her local grocery store, people stop her in the aisles with medical questions. She urges them to schedule an appointment so she can examine them.\n\nBefore the outbreak, Myrick heard many concerns about vaccines, including in Gaines County’s Mennonite community, where the measles first appeared in late January. At the family clinic, parents told Myrick that no one got measles anymore, so there was no need to vaccinate their children. And it only caused mild illness, they said. Others argued vaccines cause harm, despite the vaccine showing decades of safety. As their family doctor, she recommended they get the vaccine, which is safe and effective.\n\nHesitancy, misinformation on measles vaccine\n\nSuch claims have helped to allow measles to return with force. Health experts cite statements made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously advocated against the measles vaccine for years and has contradicted guidance from his own health agencies.\n\nIn the current outbreak, Kennedy has downplayed measles outbreaks and the severity of disease and has made incorrect statements about the current outbreak, said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC who is now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A recent op-ed by Kennedy called for parents to consult with health providers about vaccination, adding the decision to vaccinate is a \"personal one.\"\n\n“We have conditions here that are so, so highly preventable that we're going to see come back because we have some leaders who don't believe in science,” Besser said.\n\nPediatricians and family doctors now should learn about diseases relegated to history, Besser added. They should ensure they know what measles, polio and different types of meningitis look like. They should also understand isolation protocols for these illnesses.\n\nAround a fifth of unvaccinated people who get infected with measles end up hospitalized. Children who contract measles can develop pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles, or brain inflammation that can lead to hearing loss or developmental delays. Death occurs in around 1 to 3 in 1,000 infected children.\n\nThe best defense against measles, by far, is vaccination, said Besser, a trained pediatrician. The full two-dose series, first administered around a year old, is 97% effective against measles. Just one shot provides 93% protection.\n\nMeasles is highly infectious, spreading through contact with droplets released from coughing, sneezing or talking. Measles can stay in a room or on surfaces two hours after a sick person has left. One contagious person can infect 18 others around them who aren’t immunized.\n\nWhat's the truth? Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter for all the answers.\n\nWith a measles diagnosis, timing is critical\n\nA fever, cough or a rash can be a variety of different issues. But doctors can't afford to miss a measles diagnosis, said Dr. James Cutrell, an associate professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas.\n\nGiven how contagious measles is, he said, the importance of identifying it early in order to isolate the patient, test them and confirm if it’s measles is crucial to stopping the spread. Another concern is that symptoms develop typically a week or two after exposure. People can spread measles even when they’re not showing symptoms.\n\nMyrick saw this firsthand. In late January, the infected girl arrived in the emergency room with an underlying respiratory condition that put her at increased risk from the potentially deadly virus. After an emergency physician diagnosed her with measles, Myrick went to her medical texts to look up the disease to treat the girl.\n\nShe recalled the blotchy, red spots covering the girl's body from head to toe. The child was placed in isolation, with hospital staff in full gowns and masks. Through the course of the child's stay, her rash changed to smaller red dots. Myrick thought she would be the only case.\n\n“We took every precaution we could to try to contain it and keep it isolated to just that one patient,” she said. “And it didn’t work. It didn’t work at all.”\n\nAt first, the outbreak centered in the region’s Mennonite community, which had been under-vaccinated with entire families infected. Myrick and staff have now seen cases among Latino infants too young to be vaccinated but facing serious illness. Pregnant women, who are at particular risk of miscarriage or premature birth from infection, are also at risk.\n\nShe expects more cases in the community. Many families call describing measles symptoms, but they won't get tested, and they won't get treatment unless infections worsen.\n\nOutside of Gaines, the outbreak has spread in eight other counties, with exposures hundreds of miles away in and around San Antonio. Officials in New Mexico suspect their outbreak, among nine people infected, is linked to the Texas outbreak just across state lines.\n\n‘Hope and prayer’ won't end outbreak\n\nBeyond Texas and New Mexico, nearby states have much lower vaccination rates than herd immunity needed to prevent outbreaks. By comparison, Texas and New Mexico had two-dose vaccination rates among kindergartners at 94.3% and 95%, respectively. But surrounding states — including Arizona, Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma — had immunization rates below 90%, CDC data from last school year showed.\n\n“A hope and a prayer doesn’t just make it go away,” said Dr. Kisha Davis, a board member of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a health officer in Maryland. Her health department, in Montgomery County, saw one measles case a year ago in an unvaccinated person. Thanks to high immunization rates, an outbreak didn’t occur, she said. “We need to continue to be vigilant.”\n\nIn Seminole, a wooden sign read “MEASLES TESTING” across from the local health department. In addition to testing, officials have expanded vaccination sites. More people are showing up to get vaccinated, including those that once swore off the shots, said Myrick, who recently became chief medical officer for the town's hospital. Others still don’t believe in vaccines.\n\nMyrick said her children worry about catching measles. Their classmates have contracted the disease, and her children are scared about getting a rash. Both of her children are vaccinated, she reminds them.

None of them are in Florida, but there were cases reported in Georgia.\n\n“As of February 20, 2025, a total of 93 measles cases were reported by 8 jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas,” the CDC says.\n\n“There have been 3 outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) reported in 2025, and 92% of cases (86 of 93) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated.”\n\nOn Feb. 25, USA TODAY reported that the total number of cases grew to 130, with most cases in rural Texas and New Mexico.\n\nIs there a measles outbreak every year?\n\nIt is true that there are measles cases and minor outbreaks reported almost every year, according to the CDC’s chart of year-to-year measles numbers since 2000, but measles was much more common in the 1980s and ‘90s.\n\nAccording to the CDC’s history of the measles, the “widespread use of the measles vaccine drastically reduced the disease rates in the 20th century.”\n\nMillions of Americans caught the measles each year before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963. Back then, hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were hospitalized every year.\n\nNow, measles outbreaks happen on a much smaller scale, due to the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, which most children get two doses of before they reach first grade.\n\nAccording to CDC data, there were 285 cases of the measles in 2024. In 2019, the U.S. saw the largest outbreak of the measles since 1992, with 1,274 cases reported (there were 2,126 cases reported in 1992).\n\nWhen was the last death from measles in the US?\n\n“Sitting in the Cabinet Room of the White House during his first public appearance as the nation's top health official on Wednesday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said two people had died in an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas,” USA TODAY reported Thursday, Feb. 27.\n\n“But national and local health officials − including the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency Kennedy heads − say only one person has died.”\n\nBefore this year, the last time someone in the U.S. died after contracting the measles was in 2015, according to the CDC and Reuters.\n\nIs it safe to be around someone with measles?\n\nMeasles is highly contagious and can be easily contracted if you get close to someone who’s been infected, especially if you are unvaccinated.\n\n“Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n“Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.”\n\nHow do you get measles? What is the main cause of measles?\n\nAccording to the CDC, measles is so contagious that you could contract it just by being in a room where a measles infected person had been up to two hours earlier.\n\n“Measles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes,” the CDC says.\n\n“You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. This can happen even up to two hours after that person has left.”\n\nWhat are 5 symptoms of measles?\n\nMeasles is most often associated with a rash and fever, but the CDC says it “isn’t just a little rash” and can lead to dangerous complications, especially in children and babies.\n\nThe five main symptoms of the measles are fever, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes, tiny white spots in the mouth and a rash.\n\nHere’s theCDC’s timeline for measles symptoms:\n\nSeven to 14 days after a measles infection : First symptoms show High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit) Cough Runny nose (coryza) Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)\n\n: Two to three days after symptoms begin: Koplik spots Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin.\n\nThree to five days after symptoms begin: Measles rash Measles rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline. They then spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. The spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the rest of the body. When the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, ear infections and diarrhea are the most common complications among those infected with measles.\n\n“Ear infections occur in about one out of every 10 children with measles,” the CDC says. “Diarrhea is reported in less than one out of 10 people with measles.”\n\nWhat is the best treatment for measles?\n\nThe best treatment for measles is technically prevention through vaccination, since there’s no medical treatment for the disease once a person has contracted it.\n\n“There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles. Medical care is supportive and to help relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacterial infections,” the CDC says.\n\n“Since 2000, the annual number of cases has ranged from a low of 37 in 2004; to a high of 1,282 in 2019. The majority of cases in the United States have been among people who are not vaccinated against measles.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/28/arizona-measles-disneyland-outbreak-phoenix-children/22452491/", "title": "Arizona measles outbreak reaches 'critical point'", "text": "Connie Cone Sexton and Paulina Pineda\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nTwo more cases of measles were confirmed in Arizona on Tuesday, and public health officials have warned that hundreds more people in the state may have been exposed this month.\n\nBoth of the cases confirmed Tuesday — a man in Pinal County and a woman in Phoenix — were linked to a family of four whose measles cases were confirmed last week following travel to Disneyland in California.\n\nThe outbreak of measles has reached \"a critical point,\" according to Will Humble, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services.

Officials also said exposed adults who were born after 1957, have not had measles or have had only one MMR vaccine, should not go to work or public places for the same 21-day period.\n\nHealth officials say two doses of the MMR vaccine provide full protection against measles.\n\nThe Pinal County case also raises the possibility of exposure for other residents or visitors in the area, as the man who is now recovering visited various public locations while still infectious. Officials have compiled a list of businesses where the man visited Thursday and Friday, including a Kearny, Ariz. gas station and post office.\n\nHumble said the state has been in contact with health workers across Arizona, alerting them to measles symptoms.\n\n\"For many clinicians, it's an illness they've never seen,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Pinal County health officials, measles begins with a fever, red and watery eyes, a cough and a runny nose, followed by a red, raised and blotchy rash that begins on the head at the hairline and moves to the lower extremities.

The other is an infant who is not a US resident. Public health officials are investigating how the children were infected.\n\nBoth have symptoms but are in good health and receiving treatment with an antiviral medication named tecovirimat or TPOXX, which the CDC recommends for children under the age of 8 because they are considered to be at higher risk from infection.\n\nSince the monkeypox outbreak began in May, most of the cases have happened among men who have sex with men. However, anyone can catch the virus through close skin-to-skin contact. In the case of children, the agency said this could include “holding, cuddling, feeding, as well as through shared items such as towels, bedding, cups, and utensils.”\n\nThe CDC says the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine is being made available for children through special expanded use protocols. The agency has also developed new guidance for health care providers about identifying, treating and preventing monkeypox in children and teens.\n\nDr. Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, said Friday that the cases in children were not surprising and that the US should be ready to respond to more.\n\n“The social networks that we have as humans mean that we have contact with a lot of different people. And while this outbreak is spreading in a particular social network right now, I think we’ve messaged from the start that there could be cases that occur outside those networks and that we need to be vigilant for it and ready to respond and message about it,” she said.\n\n“I know that in Europe and other places where this outbreak is also expanding, they have reported cases in children, in women. And I think the same thing is happening and expected to happen here in the United States,” she said.\n\n“There is no evidence to date that we’re seeing this virus spread outside of those populations to any degree,” McQuiston said.\n\nVaccine supply improves\n\nThe US government has shipped 300,000 monkeypox vaccines to US states and territories as of Friday afternoon.\n\n“That means hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to be getting vaccinated in a matter of days or weeks,” Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said Friday. “Jurisdictions, states territories, cities are getting their vaccines typically about 30 hours after ordering them.”\n\nJha said Friday that New York City had received enough monkeypox vaccine to provide at least one dose to about half its eligible population, while DC had gotten enough to provide one dose to 70% of its eligible population.\n\nThe newly released doses increase available supply, but they cover just a small portion of the eligible population. The CDC estimates that more than 1.5 million people are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine.\n\nThe prescribing information for the Jynneos vaccine says a full course is two shots given four weeks apart. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration have said that people need both doses to fully prevent disease.\n\nBut in New York City and some other places seeing a high degree of viral spread, officials have been giving out a first shot to as many people as they can, even before second doses are available.\n\nThat strategy makes sense, Jha said Friday.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The FDA and CDC clearly believe that people need two doses. And the reason that New York and many other places have been able to move forward with a first dose out to everybody, is because we’ve been able to show them that more doses are coming and that second doses will be able to be given to people,” he said. “So given that, we encourage people to go ahead and use up all their doses as first doses.”\n\nPeople are eligible to be vaccinated for monkeypox if they know that they were exposed to the virus or if they suspect that they were exposed because they had multiple sexual partners or were at an event where monkeypox is known to have spread.\n\n“We continue to see the majority of cases in the United States as being reported among individuals who identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men,” McQuiston said. More than 99% of the US monkeypox cases for which the CDC has information have involved male-to-male sexual contact.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman Deidre Mcphillips", "Brenda Goodman", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/11/20/whooping-cough-resurgence-in-washington-a-reminder-of-vaccine-importance/76411618007/", "title": "Whooping cough surges, vaccination rates have declined across ...", "text": "Washington is likely to see more cases of whooping cough in 2024 than any year in the last decade. The state has already reported more than 1,300 cases, up from 54 at the same time in 2023.\n\nThe surge of the highly contagious bacterial infection, also known as pertussis, has been a stark reminder of how critical vaccinations are for protecting the most vulnerable, particularly infants, Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, Chief Science Officer at Washington Department of Health, said in a statement.\n\n“To protect babies from whooping cough, people of all ages should get up to date on pertussis vaccination,” he said.\n\nBut Centers Disease Controls data now shows a decline in vaccinations among school-age children. The CDC reported that about 2% fewer new kindergarteners are up to date on state-required immunization compared to pre-pandemic totals.\n\nCommunities on the Kitsap Peninsula – including schools in Kitsap County, Gig Harbor and the Key Peninsula – saw a small decline in immunizations post-pandemic, according to a review of Washington Department of Health Data.\n\nAlthough they vary by district and disease, 88.8% of Kitsap County kindergarteners completed all required vaccinations last year. That was down 0.7% compared to the year before the pandemic, but remained historically high.\n\nIn the Peninsula School District, which covers Gig Harbor and the Key Peninsula, vaccination rates were at 91% last year. That was down 1.4% from the 2019-20 school year.\n\nIn Washington, 87.6% of kindergarten students completed the required vaccinations last year. That is down 2.4% from pre-pandemic reports.\n\nDr. Gib Morrow, health officer for the Kitsap Public Health District, said Kitsap families had done a good job of receiving “routine, life-saving,” childhood vaccinations. Most Americans understand the importance of vaccines, he said. But a decrease nationally has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles, mumps and pertussis after the pandemic.\n\n“Skepticism, misinformation, and conspiracy theories have increased post-pandemic,” he said, “fueled by national leaders who ignore scientific evidence.”\n\nVaccine hesitancy and exemptions\n\nConcerns about vaccine hesitancy have been a national topic of concern among public health officials for the past several years. Conspiracy theories and misinformation – occasionally prompted by high-ranking elected-officials – have led to a growing skepticism of routine immunization.\n\nThis month, President-Elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former independent presidential candidate who has a long record espousing vaccine misinformation, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“Donald Trump’s selection of a notorious anti-vaxxer to lead HHS could not be more dangerous – this is a deep concern for every American,” Sen. Patty Murray, D-WA, said in a statement urging her fellow senators to reject his appointment.\n\nThat appointment comes as record levels of children are receiving exemptions to routine vaccination. In 2023, 3.3% of kindergarten students in the U.S. had an exemption to one or more vaccines, according to the CDC, the highest ever reported.\n\nFourteen states had exemption rates exceeding 5%. In Washington, 4.8% of students received an exemption to at least one vaccine.\n\nWashington law allows parents to exempt their children from required vaccines for four reasons: personal/philosophical; religious belief; religious membership; or medical. Only the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine cannot be exempted for a personal or philosophical reason.\n\nParents are not required to validate or provide their personal religious belief. The only requirement is that they receive a signature from a state-licensed health practitioner, including a physician, naturopath, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner.\n\nLast year 4.1% of kindergartners in Kitsap County and 6% in the Peninsula School District had an exemption to at least one required vaccine.\n\nDistrict results show largest declines in Bremerton, CK\n\nVaccines remain the most effective way to prevent illness, like whooping cough, and vaccination rates remain high in the region, but have declined.\n\nKitsap County rates for whooping declined by 1.9% from pre-pandemic levels. Immunization rates for the MMR vaccine also fell by about 3%. Rates declined in five of the six school districts on the Kitsap Peninsula last year compared to pre-pandemic levels. The largest drops were in Bremerton and Central Kitsap schools.\n\nStill, an overwhelming number of students in most districts are getting vaccinated. Excluding Bremerton, which was at 79.6%, the other five districts had rates of at least 92%.\n\nFewer students, however, had received a required whooping cough booster, said Wendy Inouye, communicable disease epidemiologist for the Kitsap Public Health District. Adolescents are advised to get a booster shot at 11 or 12 years old, prior to entering seventh grade. One out of six are not up to date, and of those over 80% are listed as out of compliance, Inouye said.\n\nBremerton was the only district in which less than 90% of kindergarten students received all required vaccines last year, according to DOH data. Over 22% of students were out of compliance with vaccination requirements.\n\nKaren Bevers, the district’s director of communications, said in an email she was unable to confirm the accuracy of those results. The district is in the middle of transitioning to a new system and current data reporting, she said, and data may not reflect current vaccination rates.\n\n“We are diligently working to update our records to provide the most accurate information possible,” she said.\n\nWhooping cough's resurgence\n\nCases of whooping cough have been low in recent years. Measures from the pandemic, including masking and distancing, may have suppressed its transmission. As those precautions have fallen off, whooping cough is returning to pre-pandemic patterns, the CDC says.\n\nIn a typical year, Washington sees anywhere from 100 to 1,000 cases, with spikes every few years, according to the DOH. Washington last recorded more than 1,300 cases in 2015.\n\nKitsap County has largely avoided contact with the outbreak this year. The county has only reported four cases as of Nov. 9. Pierce County had 85 cases, Jefferson had nine, Mason had one and King had 159.\n\nThe disease, caused by the bordetella pertussis bacteria, usually begins with cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, but can cause severe coughing fits.\n\nTeens and adults usually experience mild symptoms. But whooping cough can be potentially deadly for infants, who encounter life-threatening respiratory problems that frequently lead to hospitalization.\n\n“Pertussis can affect people of all ages, and can be very serious, even deadly, for babies less than a year old,” said Lynn Pittsinger, Community Health Director for the Kitsap Public Health District. “Babies younger than three months have the highest risk of severe disease and of dying from pertussis.”\n\nImmunization is available for people of all ages, although it is not effective for newborns who are less than 2 months old, Pittsinger said. As a result, pregnant people should get a booster shot as early as possible between the 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy to offer protection, Pittsinger said.\n\n“It is also important that all family members and caregivers are up to date with their vaccines,” she said.\n\nThe Kitsap Public Health District is hosting a free immunization clinic for kids on Dec. 11 at its office in the Norm Dicks Government Center, 345 Sixth Street, Suite 300 in Bremerton. Free, routine vaccinations are available for those 18 and younger with no insurance required.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/06/meningitis-illness-epidural-steroid/1616653/", "title": "Epidural steroid shots debated amid meningitis scare", "text": "Duane Marsteller, The Tennessean\n\nPotentially tainted steroid blamed for outbreak\n\nThe number of Medicare patients receiving such injections grew\n\nCritics say the growth in such injections is based more on money\n\nNASHVILLE -- As authorities continue to focus on a potentially contaminated steroid as the source of a widening outbreak of fungal meningitis, some patient-safety advocates are calling for greater restrictions on the type of injection involved.\n\nThey say epidural steroid injections, like the ones given to the meningitis victims, are far too dangerous and should be limited or even banned. But those who give the injections say they are safe when done properly and note the current outbreak appears to have originated from the medicine, not the procedure itself.\n\nThe debate was being waged long before the meningitis outbreak began with the Sept. 17 death of a 78-year-old man in Nashville. Since then, at least 46 other people in Tennessee and six more states have come down with the rare and noncontagious infection, federal health officials said Friday. Five, including three in Tennessee, have died.\n\nAll received spinal injections of a steroid solution prepared by New England Compounding Center, a compounding pharmacy in Framingham, Mass. The pharmacy has voluntarily ceased operations and recalled the steroid, which health officials suspect was contaminated with one or more fungi. Almost 17,700 vials were shipped to about 75 facilities in 23 states as far away as California.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the pharmacy also has recalled nearly a dozen other medications it produced that have not been linked to the outbreak.\n\nJohn Dreyzehner, Tennessee's commissioner of health, said investigators have found no indication that the three Tennessee clinics that administered the steroid injections did anything to cause the outbreak.\n\n\"Evidence indicates this is a product issue, and we emphasize that,\" he said, repeating the first part twice for effect.\n\nBut some critics say the steroid solution shouldn't have been injected in the first place, saying the procedure's risks far outweigh any medical benefits. They say the outbreak is just the latest example of how dangerous the injections really are.\n\n\"I hate that this happened, but it was inevitable,\" said Terri Lewis, a psychological rehabilitation specialist from Cookeville, Tenn. \"This procedure is not safe.\"\n\nLewis said her 29-year-old son was injured by epidural steroid shots unrelated to the menigitis outbreak. She claims the shots caused him to develop arachnoiditis, an incurable condition in which scar tissue slowly builds in the spinal column, compressing nerves that lead to debilitating pain and, ultimately, death.\n\nShe said more people like her son are being hurt as the number of injections grows.\n\nThe number of Medicare patients receiving such injections grew by 159 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to a recent study by Dr. Laxmaiah Manchikanti, chairman of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.\n\nManchikanti, who operates pain-management clinics in Paducah, Ky., and Marion, Ill., estimated 8.9 million such injections were given in 2010. He did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nSuch widespread use with relatively few reported cases of adverse side effects, plus coverage by Medicare, Medicaid and other major insurers, are evidence in support of the procedure's safety, an industry official said.\n\n\"The risk of complications from these epidural injections is very small,\" said Dr. Ray Baker of Kirkland, Wash., president of the International Spine Intervention Society, which has about 3,000 members. \"We're not talking about a very risky procedure. We're talking about a very safe procedure that has been performed for a very long time.\"\n\nWhile there are no definitive figures available, he estimated that serious complications occur in only one of every 100,000 injections.\n\nYet critics contend the growth in epidural steroid injections is based more on money than on medical need.\n\n\"It does make a lot of easy money for pain clinics,\" Lewis said.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid guidelines call for paying between $200 and $600 per injection, depending on whether it is given in a doctor's office, an outpatient facility or a hospital. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it paid providers $106.4 million for 252,288 injections last year, an average of $421.74 each.\n\nYet a 2010 audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general found a third of the 433 injections from 2007 it studied didn't meet Medicare requirements. They either were not medically necessary or had insufficient documentation about the need for the shot, the audit said.\n\nPhysicians' groups say they don't view the injections as a money-maker but as a proven, effective way to relieve their patients' back pain and suffering. But Baker acknowledged that often the drugs injected are not approved for epidural use.\n\nSome have been approved for injection elsewhere on the body but are being used \"off-label\" -- or in a way that is not specifically approved -- for epidural injection. Others were compounded, or created by combining, mixing and/or altering active ingredients to make custom medications, a process that is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBut the growing numbers of reported complications from the injections prompted the agency to launch a review panel last year.\n\nThe FDA review is focusing on the transforaminal approach, in which steroids are injected into the foramin, a small area just outside the spinal canal where nerve roots exit. This method brings needles within millimeters of crucial spinal arteries.\n\nThe review is limited to FDA-approved epidural steroid injections, which does not include those implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak, FDA spokeswoman Erica V. Jefferson said.\n\n\"These compounded steroid injections (methylprednisolone acetate) being investigated as part of the outbreak were NOT approved by the agency,\" Jefferson said in an email. \"Compounded products are not reviewed by FDA for safety, efficacy, and quality prior to marketing.\"\n\nPatient advocates such as Matthew Clark say more needs to be done.\n\nClark, of Rogersville, Tenn., received several epidural steroid injections when he lived in Michigan. He stopped after one shot resulted in his sphincter muscle relaxing, causing his intestine to temporarily protrude from his anus.\n\nHe now has arachnoiditis, which he blames on the shots.\n\n\"It's like having the pain of cancer without the relief of death,\" he said. \"Those shots should be banned.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/06"}]}

The move was met with particularly harsh criticism from some who noted the company's reputation for inclusiveness has helped it attract a younger, more diverse consumer base.\n\nThe boycott action comes as other groups of consumers and activists have been engaging in broader one-day boycotts against a wider array of companies, as well as Target and a separate boycott by Minnesota activists against Target, which began Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History month.\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target Fast?\n\nJamal-Harrison Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia and an activist and author, has called on the Black faith community to start a 40-day fast from shopping at Target during Lent starting on March 5, which is Ash Wednesday. The website targetfast.org has been created to offer information.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations – companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise,\" said the Targetfast.org website. \"As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity.\"\n\nThe site continued, saying Black America are \"strong consumers with astounding brand loyalty. To see companies we've supported heavily – like McDonald's Ford Motors, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart – betray our long-standing relationship is beyond disheartening.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Bryant said \"we called on a fast from Target because we believe that the company's change in position is a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"Black people, on average, spend $12 million a day at Target,\" Bryant said. \"The fact of the matter is that Target made a pledge to our community after the killing of George Floyd of $2 billion into Black business and when the administration changed, they disavowed as if it never happened. The pledge was never made under DEI or affirmative action. It was out of decency and to humanity. To walk away from it is insult to injury.\"\n\nBryant's group is calling on 100,000 Black Americans to take the pledge not to shop at Target for 40 days. So far, Bryant said 110,000 people had signed the pledge and \"legions more\" have also shared about the boycott on social media.\n\nConsumers who have signed a pledge on the website will receive a digital business directory from the Black Chamber of Commerce with 300,000 Black-owned businesses along with a 40-day prayer journal. Participants are also encouraged to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nThe action is making four demands of Target:\n\nHonor the $2 billion dollar pledge to the Black Business community by purchasing products, services, and making Black media buys. Deposit $250 million among 23 Black banks. Completely restore the retailer's commitment to DEI. Create community centers at 10 HBCU (Historically Black colleges and universities) to teach retail business at every level.\n\nThe 40 days of the fast is a benchmark and could be extended, Bryant said.\n\n\"Because Target is publicly traded, we'll be able to gauge what the economic impact of 110,000 people not going and diverting their funds in a different way,\" Bryant said. \"If the board and the CEO of Target remains steadfast, then we're committed to sojourn until there is an adjustment.\"\n\nTarget reports drop of sales in February\n\nThe 40-day fast of Target comes at a tough time for the retailer. On Tuesday during an earnings call, Target reported that its sales had dropped slightly in February. A nationwide boycott of Target by Minnesota activists protesting Target's rollback of DEI initiatives began Feb. 1 and another consumer group had a broader one-day economic blackout on Feb. 28.\n\n\"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year,\" Target said in a press release. Company CEO Brian Cornell also warned that prices could increase within days, due to new tariffs imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTarget has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment about boycotts against the retailer.\n\nFoot traffic has dropped at Target, according to one firm. Placer.ai, uses a panel of tens of millions of devices and utilizes machine learning to make estimations for in-store visits to locations across the country.\n\nFoot traffic at Target, Walmart, Best Buy, McDonalds and Starbucks fell for the month of February compared to January. Target's decline in foot traffic was the largest with a 9% drop, compared to a 3.6% increase in January. That was followed by an 8.7% drop for McDonald's, which was up 2.1% in January.\n\nWalmart's foot traffic dropped in February by 5.8% compared to a 3.0% increase in January, while Best Buy's foot traffic dropped 6.8% in February compared to a 0.4% increase in January.\n\nCostco, which has seen some extra support from some consumers after its board of directors voted down an effort to drop diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, had an increase in foot traffic in February of 2.2%, following an increase of 7.9% in January.\n\n“Placer.ai’s data reveals that many retailers experienced year-over-year declines in weekly visits throughout February 2025, driven by post-holiday spending pullbacks, decreased consumer confidence, economic and tariff uncertainty, and unseasonably cold weather,\" R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told USA TODAY.\n\nJoseph Feldman, an analyst with Telsey Advisory Group, in a note to clients last week, said the Placer.ai data regarding Target’s foot traffic “shows a clear drop in traffic in late January into mid-February following the company’s step back from DEI.”\n\nFeldman said that while other retailers have also reported a slower start to February, Target has become particularly susceptible to the boycott actions, on top of worries about consumer confidence and increases in prices due to tariffs.\n\n\"I do think that you could make some connection that they're getting hit with all this chatter on social media among a big cohort of their customer base,\" Feldman told USA TODAY.\n\nCould the boycott against Target work?\n\nIt makes sense that Target is being targeted because \"in 2020, Target specifically ramped up their DEI efforts in the wake of the George Floyd murder because it was in Minneapolis and their base is there,'' said Diane Merians Penaloza, doctoral lecturer in the Online Business Programs at City University of New York School of Professional Studies. \" They took it very personally and there was a reaction, which was they saw a huge increase in revenue.\"\n\nTarget's market share for Black consumers is around 18% and its core audience is millennials at around 38%, Merians Penaloza told USA TODAY. Those two groups tend to shop companies that align with their beliefs, she said, “so Target eliminating their DEI efforts takes them out of alignment with their core audience. This is something that can do some serious damage to the revenue in the long run.”\n\nBecause Target took such a significant stance on DEI efforts, the retreat from them “almost feels like it’s a personal afront in many ways,” Merians Penaloza said.\n\nTarget is also under additional pressure from tariffs and shrinking consumer demand, she said.\n\nWhat other boycotts are planned?\n\nThe 40-day fast is one of several planned by different groups. A national boycott of Target started Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History Month. It was launched by civil rights activists in Minneapolis who were upset that Target has rolled back its DEI programs.\n\nAnother boycott that lasts through the end of the year was outlined on Instagram by comedian and actress Leslie Jones. It encourages consumers to buy directly from Black-owned businesses and outlines planned protests in certain months against Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe Latino community has also been active on social media using the hashtag #LatinoFreeze, encouraging supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, reduced funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network also have held a few \"buy-cotts\" to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company's board of directors, which voted down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nThe National Action Network also said in a news release that it would lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThe People's Union USA, an organization started by John Swartz, who organized the Feb. 28 one-day blackout, has since expanded its boycotting efforts. It includes boycotts of various companies and retailers during different time periods including Amazon (March 7-14), Nestle (March 21-28), Walmart (April 7-14) and a second broader one-day economic blackout on April 18, which may be expanded to a weekend-long event, Swartz has said, among others. A website, thepeoplesunionusa.com, has more information on the group's efforts.\n\nDo boycotts work?\n\nBoycotts can have mixed results.\n\nConservative activists have successfully rallied in recent years to force retailers and companies to rein in their DEI efforts by staging boycotts to hurt sales.\n\nProfessors have previously told USA TODAY that boycotts can be successful in shaming a company into reversing decisions or taking action, but they don't always work. There needs to be clear demands outlined, they say. But consumers do like being able to take action against something they feel strongly about.\n\nThe Feb. 28 one-day economic blackout was interesting because it was coming from so many different audiences simultaneously, but Merians Penaloza said she is unsure if it had any real impact, other than a symbolic one.\n\n“I think that an entire community of people getting together and saying ‘We’re not going to shop for 40 days this brand’ is impactful,” she said. “It will expand outside of just that audience and everybody who is sympathetic to that audience is also going to participate, so it has the ability to make a bigger impact.\n\nThe outcome will also depend however on the action getting lots of public and media attention, Merians Penaloza said.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

More boycotts are planned against Amazon and Walmart in the coming days.\n\nHere's what we know about it.\n\nWho is leading the Target boycott?\n\nThe consumer spending pause, led by Atlanta Pastor Jamal Bryant, encourages shoppers to refrain from purchasing anything from Target during the \"40-day fast\" to coincide with the start of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting and prayer leading up to Easter.\n\nWhy has Target been singled out for a boycott?\n\nBryant named several major retailers — Walmart, McDonald's and Amazon — who have rolled back DEI policies but said they chose to Target in part because it's headquartered in Minneapolis, the same city where police officers killed George Floyd.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target boycott about?\n\nBryant and other Black faith leaders have voiced their frustration with Target, they said, for reneging on a $2 billion promise to invest in Black-owned companies by the end of 2025.\n\n\"When George Floyd was killed, Target came out and made an announcement that they're going to invest $2 billion into Black business,\" Bryant said Wednesday during an interview on The Breakfast Club.\n\n\"When Trump made the announcement of January 2025, (Target) dishonored their commitment,\" Bryant said, alluding to President Donald Trump's threats in January the federal government would investigate corporations with DEI programs.\n\nWithin two days of Trump threatening legal action, Target announced it was ending its Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) initiatives, under which it had pledged to invest $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, as well as add more than 500 Black-owned brands and a funding program from its in-house media company.\n\nIn addition to boycotting Target, investors have been asked to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nDid the Feb. 28 boycott work?\n\nAccording to Forbes, several retailers including Walmart and Amazon, saw a slight dip in web traffic during the 24-hour Economic Blackout last week, but Target was hit hardest with a 9% drop. Meanwhile, the publication says that Costco, which stood by its DEI initiatives, experienced a boost in web traffic of 22%.\n\nTrump's tariffs could also harm Target, lead to increased prices for shoppers\n\nTarget's recent earnings report indicated a \"decline in February net sales.\" Along with consumer uncertainty, the company says tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will yield more \"profit pressure\" and warns shoppers to expect price hikes on certain goods, such as fruits and vegetables.\n\nHow long is the Target boycott?\n\nThe no-spend period began Wednesday, March 5, and will continue for 40 days to align with Lent, which takes place March 5-April 17, 2025. The NAACP urged customers to instead support Black businesses as well as businesses that maintain its DEI programs.\n\nHow many Target stores are in Indiana?\n\nThere are upwards of 32 Target locations in Indiana, according to the retailer's official website, including two in Carmel, five in Indianapolis and three in Fort Wayne.\n\nAvon\n\nAvon: 10209 E US Highway 36.\n\nBloomington\n\nCarmel\n\nClarksville\n\nWaterford Park: 1125 Veterans Pkwy.\n\nColumbus\n\nColumbus: 1865 N National Rd.\n\nEvansville\n\nFishers\n\nFishers: 11750 Commercial Dr.\n\nFort Wayne\n\nGoshen\n\nGoshen: 3938 Midway Rd.\n\nGranger\n\nMishawaka: 155 University Dr E.\n\nGreenwood\n\nGreenwood South: 895 S State Rd 135\n\nHighland\n\nHighland: 10451 Indianapolis Blvd.\n\nIndianapolis\n\nKokomo\n\nKokomo: 1037 S Reed Rd.\n\nLafayette\n\nMerrillville\n\nLake County: 2661 E US Highway 30.\n\nMuncie\n\nMuncie: 3601 N Barr St.\n\nMunster\n\nMunster: 8005 Calumet Ave\n\nNew Albany\n\nNew Albany: 2209 State St.\n\nPlainfield\n\nPlainfield: 2673 E Main St.\n\nSaint John\n\nSaint John: 9885 Wicker Ave.\n\nSouth Bend\n\nSouth Bend: 1400 E Ireland Rd.\n\nValparaiso\n\nValparaiso: 2420 Laporte Ave.\n\nWest Lafayette\n\nWest Lafayette State Street: 300 W State St.\n\nAre more boycotts planned?\n\nYes.

Here's what they plan for ...", "text": "Consumers are rallying to speak through their wallets − or lack of spending – as a way to protest the retreat by some companies from diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and President Donald Trump's actions to eliminate federal DEI programs since taking office. They are calling on consumers to boycott specific retailers and for one day later this month to refrain from spending any money at all.\n\nNumerous social media accounts are sharing the message of a 24-hour consumer spending blackout planned for Feb. 28. Consumers are encouraged not to spend money in stores or online for the day, and if they have emergencies or essentials they need, they are encouraged to support a local small business.\n\nIt is unclear which organization started the Feb. 28 blackout campaign, but several Instagram posts by a group called The People's Union and its founder, who goes by the Instagram handle \"TheOneCalledJai\" have been reshared and circulated about the one-day blackout.\n\nFrom Bud Light to Target: Boycotts take off\n\nThe strategy has worked for the political right.\n\nIn campaigns using hashtags and slogans like “go woke go broke,” boycotts waged by conservative activists have taken aim at some of the nation’s largest consumer names, including retail chain Target. Some have succeeded in slashing sales and forcing policy changes.\n\nFollowers of Robby Starbuck pressured the likes of Walmart, Ford, Harley-Davidson and Tractor Supply to rein in their DEI efforts.\n\nBud Light, owned by beer giant Anheuser-Busch, struggled after conservative blowback over a social media campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nTarget moved its Pride displays from the entrances to the back of stores after shoppers confronted employees and vandalized displays. Last year, Target scaled back its Pride collection and did not carry the collection in all stores.\n\nA growing number of companies have retreated on DEI commitments as those efforts come under greater scrutiny in a rapidly changing legal and political climate.\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump ordered federal agencies to crack down on DEI and investigate the DEI programs of private companies.\n\nNow Target and other companies find themselves under attack from the other side, facing calls for boycotts from DEI supporters angry over the rollbacks.\n\nThat's an increasingly common dilemma for corporations − and one of their own making, said David Primo, professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. He blames years of \"haphazard policymaking\" by companies on contentious issues like DEI.\n\n“Companies need to figure out what they will take positions on, what they won’t take positions on, and then stand firm,\" Primo said. \"Holding your finger to the political winds is not an effective way to run a company in a polarized world.”\n\nWhat is the Feb. 28 consumer economic blackout?\n\nIn one of several videos about the Feb. 28 blackout, the Instagram handle \"TheOneCalledJai\" said the day of economic resistance is to show that \"we the people are the system.\"\n\n\"For decades, they have told us that we are powerless, that we have no control, and that this system is too big, too strong, too unshakable.\n\n\"We are going to remind them who has the power. For one day, we turn it off for one day. We shut it down for one day. We remind them that this country does not belong to the elite, it belongs to the people, and this will work.\n\n\"Some of you might say one day won't make a difference and that's exactly what they want you to believe,\" the video said. \"If enough of us participate, they will feel it and if they don't listen, we escalate.\"\n\nA second economic blackout aimed at blocking purchases from Amazon from March 7 through March 14 has also been announced by the same group.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, John Schwarz, who is the man behind the Instagram handle, said what started as a bold idea while he was posting a video to express his frustration has gained traction quickly.\n\n\"I'm trying to use my platform right now to organize and gather people who can see past what divides us and potentially maybe down the road legally find some way to unionize ourselves, to create a powerful voice within the system to create change,\" Schwarz said.\n\n\"But for now, the economic blackout is about getting people together, up off the couch, so to speak, to do something together.\"\n\nSchwarz said the blackout isn't intended to protest one specific thing, but the timing is right.\n\nSchwarz said he will start with the one-day economic blackout and March Amazon boycott to get people gathered and then expand to monthly boycotts of other businesses \"that are really the biggest offenders within the system.\" Schwarz said he is running the effort alone but is looking for people to join him.

The boycott started Feb. 1 in response to Target's decision to phase out DEI initiatives. It is an indefinite boycott until Target changes its actions, said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network.\n\nThe DEI retreat \"really felt like a slap in the face,\" Levy Armstrong told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Target was a beloved community that seemed to build its model around embracing diversity and being intentionally inclusive of having Black brands on the shelves, having beautiful Black History Month displays. For them to essentially bow down to the mandates of the Trump administration was unacceptable.\"\n\nThe boycott coincides with Black History Month. Organizers, which include several other civil rights organizations in Minnesota, have since encouraged consumers to support Black-owned brands in Target by buying directly from the businesses' websites after some Black-owned businesses expressed concern about the boycott.\n\nLevy Armstrong said support for the boycott has been good, and she sees other boycotts planned against Target and other companies as \"complementary.\" Her groups' efforts for now will be focused on Target, she said.\n\n\"People feel empowered in a moment in which they felt powerless and somewhat helpless.\"\n\nLatino community also boycotting with #LatinoFreeze\n\nThe Latino community also is encouraging a freeze on spending. Using the hashtags #LatinoFreezeMovement and #LatinoFreeze, social media posts for the movement have encouraged supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe website latinofreeze.com has a list of companies that have been supportive or critical of DEI efforts.\n\nMore consumer boycotts planned\n\nAt least two other consumer boycotts are planned.\n\nComedian and actress Leslie Jones announced on her Instagram account planned boycotts and buying actions starting in February and continuing through the end of the year. That plan explained in the video starts and ends with encouraging purchases directly from Black-owned businesses and then planned boycotts for one to two months at a time against Walmart, Target and Amazon.\n\nPastor Jamal-Harrison Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia and an activist and author, has called on the faith community to start a 40-day fast from shopping at Target during Lent starting on March 5, which is Ash Wednesday. The website targetfast.org also has been created to offer information.\n\nTarget and Amazon did not return messages seeking comment about potential boycotts. A Walmart spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nBoycotts can be successful, but for different reasons\n\nBoycotts can be effective, but not in the way that consumers think, said Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe boycotts create attention for the cause, including from the media, which \"puts a negative spotlight on the companies they're boycotting, and that could in the long run have reputational consequences,\" King told USA TODAY. \"What boycotts don't seem to do is have much of an impact on consumer behavior.\"\n\nConsumers can usually handle a boycott for a day, \"but over longer periods of time, most boycotts don't have any kind of impact on sales.\"\n\nThat's because consumer purchasing, especially for online shopping, \"tends to occur in private where others can't see or judge them.\"\n\nKing said a boycott of Bud Light in 2023, sparked by conservative consumers upset that the beer maker had teamed up with a transgender influencer, was successful because of a couple of key reasons.\n\nPeople tend to consume beer in public, so they could be held accountable, King said. There also were easy substitutes of other beer brands that consumers could choose instead.\n\nFor a boycott to be successful, organizers also have to figure out what success means: \"Is it that customers can feel better about expressing their values, or is it intended to change corporate behavior?\" said Gerald Davis, a professor of management and sociology at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\nA boycott needs a clear goal, a clear target group and an identifiable representative of that group who can negotiate with the target on their behalf, he said.\n\n\"Simply asking customers to stop buying a product to express disapproval is not likely to produce any recognizable change in what business does,\" he said.\n\nConsumers can express their voice through a boycott\n\nStill, a boycott can be a positive way for consumers to express themselves through action, King said.\n\n\"Saying you're going to boycott something does feel like you're casting a vote that you hope makes a difference down the road,\" he said. It is a way for people upset about the Trump administration's actions or companies' responses to DEI initiatives \"to convert grievances into action.\"\n\nToo many protest actions can cause confusion\n\nThere are also several social media messages that outline other boycott efforts in different time frames against specific retailers. That is usually \"one of the biggest difficulties activists face, which is they're not just competing with all the other events and things that are happening with the world, but also competing with each other and for attention,\" King said.\n\nThe most successful boycotts are ones where \"there's a lot of unity among the various strands of people who count themselves ... in that camp.\"\n\nShopping in support of a business can also work\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network have recently taken action at two Costco locations in New York City and in Union, New Jersey, to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company board of director's actions to vote down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nNational Action Network also said in a news release about the \"buy-cott\" that it will lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

The company has about 280 locations in California alone.\n\nOther California companies that have been named in the boycotts are:\n\nTesla\n\nGoogle\n\nMeta\n\nCoca-Cola is another big company that has faced social media backlash after a rumor spread that it was assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. However, no such evidence has been verified, and as of 4 p.m. Friday, the company has yet to release a statement.\n\nThe list of companies that are not California-based but have a large presence in the state include:\n\nHome Depot\n\nChick-fil-A\n\nHobby Lobby\n\nTarget\n\nWalmart\n\nAmazon\n\nBoycotts can be successful, but for different reasons\n\nBoycotts can be pretty effective, but not in the way that consumers think, said Brayden King, a professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.\n\nThe boycotts create attention for the cause, including from the media, which \"puts a negative spotlight on the companies they're boycotting and that could in the long run have reputational consequences,\" King told USA TODAY.\n\n\"What boycotts don't seem to do is have much of an impact on consumer behavior,\" King said.\n\nConsumers can usually handle a boycott for a day, \"but over longer periods of time, most boycotts don't have any kind of impact on sales.\"\n\nThat's because consumer purchasing, especially for online shopping, \"tends to occur in private where others can't see or judge them.\"\n\nKing said a boycott of Bud Light in 2023, sparked by conservative consumers upset that the beer maker had teamed up with a transgender influencer, was successful because of a couple key reasons.\n\nPeople tend to consume beer in public, so they could be held accountable, King said.

The shift attracted particularly harsh criticism from some who noted the company's reputation for inclusiveness has helped it attract a younger, more diverse consumer base.\n\nThe boycott action comes as other groups of consumers and activists have been engaging in broader one-day boycotts against a wider array of companies, as well as Target and a separate boycott by Minnesota activists against Target, which began Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History month.\n\nHere's what we know about the Target boycott.\n\nWhat is an 'economic blackout'? Why people in Texas are boycotting businesses for 24 hours\n\nWhat is the 40-day Target Fast? What to know about the national boycott\n\nThe national Target boycott is led by Black faith leaders like Jamal-Harrison Bryant, who are urging members of their congregation to protest the rollback on DEI initiatives.\n\nBryant is a senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia as well as an activist and author. He has called on the Black faith community to start a \"40-day fast\" from shopping at Target. The period coincides with Lent, which began on March 6 and continues through April 20.\n\nMore information about the boycott can be found at the website targetfast.org.\n\n\"In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations – companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise,\" Targetfast.org states. \"As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity.\"\n\nThe site continued, saying Black America are \"strong consumers with astounding brand loyalty. To see companies we've supported heavily — like McDonald's Ford Motors, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart — betray our long-standing relationship is beyond disheartening.\"\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Bryant said \"we called on a fast from Target because we believe that the company's change in position is a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"Black people, on average, spend $12 million a day at Target,\" Bryant said. \"The fact of the matter is that Target made a pledge to our community after the killing of George Floyd of $2 billion into Black business and when the administration changed, they disavowed as if it never happened. The pledge was never made under DEI or affirmative action. It was out of decency and to humanity. To walk away from it is insult to injury.\"\n\nBryant's group is calling on 100,000 Black Americans to take the pledge not to shop at Target for 40 days.So far, Bryant said 110,000 people had signed the pledge and \"legions more\" have also shared about the boycott on social media.\n\nConsumers who have signed a pledge on the website will receive a digital business directory from the Black Chamber of Commerce with 300,000 Black-owned businesses along with a 40-day prayer journal. Participants are also encouraged to sell any Target stock they may own.\n\nThe action is making four demands of Target:\n\nHonor the $2 billion dollar pledge to the Black Business community by purchasing products, services, and making Black media buys. Deposit $250 million among 23 Black banks. Completely restore the retailer's commitment to DEI. Create community centers at 10 HBCU (Historically Black colleges and universities) to teach retail business at every level.\n\nThe 40 days of the fast is a benchmark and could be extended, Bryant said.\n\n\"Because Target is publicly traded, we'll be able to gauge what the economic impact of 110,000 people not going and diverting their funds in a different way,\" Bryant said. \"If the board and the CEO of Target remains steadfast, then we're committed to sojourn until there is an adjustment.\"\n\nTarget reports drop of sales in February after change in DEI policy\n\nThe 40-day fast of Target comes at a tough time for the retailer. On Tuesday during an earnings call, Target reported that its sales had dropped slightly in February. A nationwide boycott of Target by Minnesota activists protesting Target's rollback of DEI initiatives began Feb. 1, and another consumer group had a broader one-day economic blackout on Feb. 28.\n\n\"In light of ongoing consumer uncertainty and a small decline in February net sales, combined with tariff uncertainty and the expected timing of certain costs within the fiscal year, the company expects to see meaningful year-over-year profit pressure in its first quarter relative to the remainder of the year,\" Target said in a press release. Company CEO Brian Cornell also warned that prices could increase within days, due to new tariffs imposed on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTarget has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment about boycotts against the retailer.\n\nCould the boycott against Target work?\n\nIt makes sense that Target is being targeted because \"in 2020, Target specifically ramped up their DEI efforts in the wake of the George Floyd murder because it was in Minneapolis and their base is there,'' said Diane Merians Penaloza, doctoral lecturer in the Online Business Programs at City University of New York School of Professional Studies. \" They took it very personally and there was a reaction, which was they saw a huge increase in revenue.\"\n\nTarget's market share for Black consumers is around 18% and its core audience is millennials at around 38%, Merians Penaloza told USA TODAY. Those two groups tend to shop companies that align with their beliefs, she said, “so Target eliminating their DEI efforts takes them out of alignment with their core audience. This is something that can do some serious damage to the revenue in the long run.”\n\nBecause Target took such a significant stance on DEI efforts, the retreat from them “almost feels like it’s a personal afront in many ways,” Merians Penaloza said.\n\nTarget is also under additional pressure from tariffs and shrinking consumer demand, she said.\n\nHow many Targets does Texas have?\n\nTexas has the second-highest number of Target stores among states, according to ScrapeHero. With 157 locations, Texas is home to 8% of all U.S. stores. California claims 318, or 16% of stores.\n\nWhat other boycotts are planned? See list\n\nThe 40-day fast is one of several planned by different groups. A national boycott of Target started Feb. 1 to coincide with Black History Month. It was launched by civil rights activists in Minneapolis who were upset that Target has rolled back its DEI programs.\n\nAnother boycott that lasts through the end of the year was outlined on Instagram by comedian and actress Leslie Jones. It encourages consumers to buy directly from Black-owned businesses and outlines planned protests in certain months against Amazon, Target and Walmart.\n\nThe Latino community has also been active on social media using the hashtag #LatinoFreeze, encouraging supporters to \"hold your money'' amid freezes on DEI initiatives, reduced funding for the National Institutes of Health and actions on immigration.\n\nThe movement encourages Latino Americans to shop only for essentials and to be thoughtful about where to buy with a focus on supporting \"Latino American, Black American and Allied American Businesses that are supportive to this movement.\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network also have held a few \"buy-cotts\" to bring supporters to Costco to spend money in support of the company's board of directors, which voted down an effort to drop DEI initiatives.\n\nThe National Action Network also said in a news release that it would lead \"a strategic boycott in the next 90 days of two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments amid public pressure.\" No details have been released.\n\nThe People's Union USA, an organization started by John Swartz, who organized the Feb. 28 one-day blackout, has since expanded its boycotting efforts. It includes boycotts of various companies and retailers over different weeks:\n\nAmazon: March 7 - 14\n\nNestle: March 21-28\n\nWalmart: April 7 - 14\n\nAnother broad one-day economic blackout, like the one on Feb. 28, is planned for April 18 — which may be extended through the weekend, Swartz said.\n\nMore information on the group's efforts can be found at the website thepeoplesunionusa.com.\n\nHow effective are boycotts?\n\nBoycotts can have mixed results.\n\nConservative activists have successfully rallied in recent years to force retailers and companies to rein in their DEI efforts by staging boycotts to hurt sales.\n\nProfessors have previously told USA TODAY that boycotts can be successful in shaming a company into reversing decisions or taking action, but they don't always work. There needs to be clear demands outlined, they say. But consumers do like being able to take action against something they feel strongly about.\n\nThe Feb. 28 one-day economic blackout was interesting because it was coming from so many different audiences simultaneously, but Merians Penaloza said she is unsure if it had any real impact, other than a symbolic one.\n\n“I think that an entire community of people getting together and saying ‘We’re not going to shop for 40 days this brand’ is impactful,” she said. “It will expand outside of just that audience and everybody who is sympathetic to that audience is also going to participate, so it has the ability to make a bigger impact.\n\nThe outcome will also depend, however, on the action getting lots of public and media attention, Merians Penaloza said.\n\n— USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/02/21/target-lawsuit-florida-dei-pride-consumer-boycott/79412672007/", "title": "Target DEI, Pride lawsuit in Florida: Some customers feel betrayed", "text": "Florida's new attorney general James Uthmeier is going after Target for its Pride merchandise and displays, alleging in a class-action lawsuit filed Thursday that the national retailer \"knowingly misled and defrauded\" investors by concealing the risks of its \"radical LGBTQ activism,\" according to a release.\n\nLast year, Target's Pride Collection triggered backlash and boycotts from conservatives and a run of people posting videos of themselves knocking over displays and confronting employees before the company pulled some of the items, saying they did it to protect the safety of their staff.\n\nThe LGBTQ-themed merchandise included cheerful, affirmative statements on clothing, sandals, pins, mugs and glasses along with the most controversial item, \"tuck-friendly\" swimwear for trans women.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that due to the backlash, Target's stock price plummeted $10 billion in market value in 10 days and $25 billion in shareholder value over six months, saying it was the Minneapolis-based retailer's \"longest losing streak in 23 years.\"\n\n“Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,\" Uthmeier said. \"My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre. We appreciate America First Legal’s assistance in the fight to keep Florida’s investments safe.”\n\nTarget's share price is currently down more than 50% from its peak in November 2021, Reuters reported.\n\nIn an earnings call in August 2023, Target executives admitted that the backlash to its Pride line was a “signal for us to pause, adapt and learn,” but Neil Saunders, managing director for retail at analytics company GlobalData, told the Washington Post that rising inflation was also an issue and the company's sales were \"on a downward slope long before Pride became an issue.\"\n\nUthmeier and private attorneys filed the 163-page lawsuit in federal court in Fort Myers on behalf of the State Board of Administration, the agency that manages Florida’s massive pension fund. The lawsuit is one of at least three similar cases against Target in Florida, including one a Florida ruled in December could go forward.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer has said in court papers that it repeatedly warned investors about the risk of consumer boycotts from its social and environmental initiatives.\n\nTarget facing new backlash from LGBTQ, civil rights activists\n\nAlong with the lawsuits, Target is now facing backlash from a different direction.\n\nThe company announced it was ending its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) program in January just a few days after President Donald Trump issued executive orders eliminating DEI in the federal government. But after spending years building up its reputation as a leader in LGBTQ issues — publicly supporting gay marriage before it was legal, allowing transgender employees to choose their bathrooms — and minority hiring initiatives, many customers are feeling betrayed.\n\nEven the daughters of one of the company's co-founders, Anne and Lucy Dayton, called the DEI rollback a \"betrayal\" in a letter to the Los Angeles Times. \"By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success,\" they said.\n\nBlack faith leaders have called on their congregations to join a 40-day boycott of Target, and consumers on social media have been calling for a national boycott of specific retailers, including Target, and a complete consumer spending blackout on Feb. 28 to protest those retailers from backing up on their DEI programs.\n\nWhat was Target's Pride Month celebration?\n\nBefore the 2023 backlash, Target celebrated LGBTQ Pride Month every year for a decade with more than 2,000 products including colorful, affirmative clothing, books and furnishings for adults and children.\n\nSome of 2023's items included:\n\nPlanters labeled \"Grow at Your Own Pace\"\n\nA \"Bodies Aren't Binary\" scented candle\n\nA \"Queer All Year\" wall calendar\n\nTote bags, pet hoodies, socks, rainbow sandals, welcome mats, gingerbread houses\n\n\"Cheers Queers\" drinking glasses\n\nMugs that say, \"Gender Fluid\" and \"Your Story Matters\"\n\nGreeting cards that say \"Glad You Came Out\" and \"I'm Happy That You're Queer\"\n\n\"Tuck-friendly\" swimwear designed for trans women\n\nSome of the products were labeled as \"Thoughtfully fit on multiple body types and gender expressions.\"\n\nThe tuck-friendly swimwear received the most derision. Critics also incorrectly claimed that Target was selling Satanic-themed shirts and pins.

Of man and machine coming together to engineer something that's never been done before at a price point that's that seems unachievable.\"\n\nHe said that Intuitive Machines will decipher Athena's exact precision by going through the photos transmitted back to Earth. After that the company will continue its planned 10-day water-hunting and research mission on the lunar south pole.\n\nAthena is company's second spacecraft to land on moon\n\nAthena, which is on a $62.5 million mission for NASA known as IM-2, is now the second spacecraft manufactured by Intuitive Machines to make it to the lunar surface.\n\nThe aerospace company, based in Houston, previously etched its name in the history books in February when its spacecraft, Odysseus, became the first commercially built lunar lander to make it to the moon. The lunar mission also marked the United States' return to the moon for the first time in more than five decades since NASA's Apollo era came to an end.\n\nThe landing marks a historic moment when two lunar landers manufactured by separate companies could be operating on the moon's surface at the same time. On Sunday, Firefly Aerospace, also based in Texas, landed its own spacecraft, Blue Ghost, on the moon's Earth-facing side.\n\nThe work ahead for both landers is vital, according to NASA, which aims under its Artemis program to use a slate of uncrewed lunar missions to lay the foundation for a permanent lunar settlement when humans return as early as 2027. Ahead of those crewed lunar landings? America's next giant leap: sending the first astronauts to Mars potentially in the 2030s.\n\n\"Our goal is to look at what resources actually exist on the moon so that we can get ready to have our sustained human presence, and then prepare to send astronauts onto Mars,\" NASA Associate Administrator Nicola Fox said at the Thursday news conference. \"We always think of the moon lighting our way to Mars.\"\n\nWhen did Athena enter moon's orbit?\n\nThe touchdown comes after the spacecraft, part of a class of lunar landers known as Nova-C, entered the moon's orbit Monday just days after launching on and separating from the Falcon 9 rocket to begin its independent voyage. Since entering lunar orbit, the solar-powered lander has been circling the moon once about every two hours while waiting for the sun to rise on the permanently shadowed south pole to power surface operations.\n\nAthena then completed a maneuver at 5:33 a.m. Thursday to position itself as close to the surface as possible, about 62 miles above, to attempt a descent.\n\nThe landing site near a plateau known as Mons Mouton is even further south than Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander reached more than a year ago, according to the company. The crater-ridden region is one of nine possible lunar landing sites identified by NASA for its crewed Artemis III lunar mission.\n\n\"It's 20,000 feet higher than any of the neighboring features around the lunar south pole, and it's believed to be untouched by any lunar impacts for billions of years,\" Fox said Thursday.\n\nThe mesa-like lunar mountain towers over a landscape carved by craters, including the Shackleton Crater – a cold, dark region where water ice and other volatile materials that turn easily into gas are thought to be abundant.\n\nWhat's next for the IM-2 mission?\n\nAs the mission name suggests, IM-2 is the second mission NASA hired Intuitive Machines to carry out following IM-1 in 2024.\n\nThe mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS, which the U.S. space agency implemented to find lower-cost methods to finance privately-managed lunar deliveries without having to develop spacecraft of its own.\n\nExpectations have been high for Intuitive Machines to pull off a second landing after Odysseus made it to the moon last February, though the lander tipped over when it touched down. But landing Athena on the moon's south pole is just the first step in its mission.\n\nAboard the lunar lander is a fleet of technology that NASA and other private companies paid to have delivered to and deployed on the moon. Those scientific instruments would next be put to use, doing everything from hunting for water beneath the surface to testing Nokia's high-speed, long-range communications systems.\n\nThe main experiment onboard Athena is NASA's PRIME-1 (Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1,) which will search for resources like water in the lunar soil that could be extracted and used by future explorers to produce fuel or breathable oxygen.\n\nAlso on board are several small vehicles that will expand the area capable of being explored during the mission. That includes Intuitive Machine's propulsive drone known as the Micro Nova Hopper, which can hop across the lunar surface, and the first-ever commercial rover to land on the moon, the MAPP rover (Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform) manufactured by a Colorado company named Lunar Outpost.\n\nAdditionally, an instrument known as a laser retroreflector array (LRA) on the top deck of the lander will be able to bounce laser light back at any incoming spacecraft – a vital capability to determine the locations of lunar landers more accurately.\n\nWhat's on board Athena? Intuitive Machines' spacecraft is packed and ready to explore the moon\n\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lands Sunday\n\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost spacecraft took a much longer route to make it Sunday to the moon after lifting off Jan. 15 from the same launch site and atop the same model of rocket.\n\nBlue Ghost's landing site is near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille on the moon's Earth-facing side. The region is located within Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide basin on the moon's near side, that is believed to have been created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago.\n\nNow that it's on the surface, the lander has commenced its $101.5 million mission of deploying a fleet of 10 NASA science instruments to test the lunar environment. The technology will next be put to use for a complete lunar day, equivalent to about 14 Earth days.\n\nBoth the Blue Ghost and Athena landers will also be able to document a total lunar eclipse, which will be visible March 13-14 across the United States and the rest of North America.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Firefly Aerospace, the Texas-based company that built and is operating the spacecraft, was hired by NASA to carry a fleet of scientific instruments to the moon's Earth-facing side to study its environment ahead of plans for astronauts to return in the years ahead.\n\nThe landing precedes by just four days the planned arrival of a second uncrewed American spacecraft built and operated by Intuitive Machines. The space exploration company, also based in Texas, etched its name in the history books a year ago when its spacecraft, Odysseus, became the first commercially-built lunar lander in the U.S. to ever make it to the moon.\n\nIntuitive Machines' second lander, Athena, is targeting a Thursday, March 6 touchdown on the lunar south pole following a Feb. 26 launch from Florida.\n\nWere astronauts to step foot on the moon as early as 2027 under NASA's Artemis campaign, they'd be the first Americans to do so in five decades since the space agency's Apollo era came to an end in the 1970s.\n\nBut as nostalgic as humanity's return to the moon would be, NASA's lunar interests are far from being merely sentimental. Once astronauts can return to the moon – and uncrewed landers like Blue Ghost and Athena are considered vital in laying that groundwork – they'd then fuel up and prepare to continue onward to Mars.\n\n“This incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and American companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all,” NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro said in a statement. “The technological and science demonstrations onboard Firefly’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 will improve our ability to not only discover more science, but to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments for future human exploration – both in the short term and long term.”\n\nFirefly Aerospace lands Blue Ghost spacecraft on moon\n\nAfter arriving more than two weeks ago to lunar orbit, the Blue Ghost lander, standing more than 6 feet tall, took about an hour to descend in the early Sunday hours. The landing, which NASA and Firefly both livestreamed, concluded by 3:34 a.m. EST with the spacecraft landing in an \"upright, stable configuration,\" Firefly Aerospace said on its mission blog.\n\nPowered by three solar panels, the spacecraft was designed to stick the landing with shock-absorbing feet, a low center of mass and a wide footprint, according to Firefly Aerospace.\n\nThe landing site is near a volcanic feature called Mons Latreille. The region is located within Mare Crisium, a 300-mile-wide basin in the northeast quadrant of the moon's near side, that is believed to have been created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago.\n\n“Firefly is literally and figuratively over the moon,” said Jason Kim, the CEO of Firefly Aerospace in a statement. \"Our Blue Ghost lunar lander now has a permanent home on the lunar surface with 10 NASA payloads and a plaque with every Firefly employee’s name.\"\n\n'Literally, figuratively over the moon': Firefly's Blue Ghost lands on lunar surface\n\nLunar landing comes after 45-day trip through space\n\nThe landing concludes a more-than 2.8 million-mile journey that began Jan. 15 when Blue Ghost hitched a ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for a launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida on the historic launch pad 39A – the site of the space agency's Apollo moon mission launches.\n\nFirefly Aerospace has since been regularly providing online updates on the mission, which it's dubbed Ghost Riders in the Sky after the popular country song. Among those updates are many stunning images and videos Firefly has shared that the lander captured throughout its 45-day expedition.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Blue Ghost captured the first images of the moon in the distance days after it fired its engines in a critical burn to raise its apogee – the point when it is furthest from Earth in its orbit of the planet – as it prepared to enter the moon's orbit.\n\nThe lander also observed and documented the Earth eclipsing the moon – from its vantage, at least – and on Feb. 3 beamed back an incredible \"selfie\" with Earth in the background.\n\nBlue Ghost then captured some striking images of the moon shortly after it entered lunar orbit Feb. 13.\n\nLast week, Blue Ghost got a look of the moon's far side, an area not visible to Earth, that shows our planet rising and setting behind our celestial neighbor. Firefly Aerospace shared the imagery following Blue Ghost's maneuvers to get the spacecraft closer and closer to the lunar surface ahead of the landing.\n\nWhat's next for Blue Ghost lunar lander?\n\nNow that Firefly Aerospace's spacecraft has made it to the surface, it can begin its mission to deliver and help test a fleet of NASA's scientific instruments to study the moon's environment before humans return.\n\nThe 10 instruments Blue Ghost transported to the moon constitute what NASA said is the largest delivery to date under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. The CLPS program allows the U.S. space agency to find lower-cost methods to finance lunar deliveries without having to develop spacecraft of its own, as it historically has done.\n\nThe technology will next be put to use for a complete lunar day, equivalent to about 14 Earth days.\n\nThe instruments Blue Ghost carries, many of which were tested in transit to the moon, are for things like lunar subsurface drilling, sample collection, X-ray imaging and dust mitigation. The data NASA hopes to collect should also provide insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect Earth.\n\nAdditionally, Blue Ghost plans to capture high-definition imagery of a total lunar eclipse as the Earth blocks the sun above the moon's horizon just before a lunar sunset ushers in frigid lunar night a couple days later. The total lunar eclipse will be visible to millions from Earth on March 13-14.\n\n“The science and technology we send to the moon now helps prepare the way for future NASA exploration and long-term human presence to inspire the world for generations to come,” Nicky Fox, associate administrator for science at NASA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. said in a statement. “We’re sending these payloads by working with American companies – which supports a growing lunar economy.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

An engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nThe tests set the Odysseus craft up to enter lunar orbit Wednesday ahead of its landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region. Scientists have long been interested in studying the south pole because of the water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines is working with NASA\n\nIntuitive Machines' lunar mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface. The success of Intuitive Machines in putting a lander on the moon will now pave the way for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon. The instruments will collect valuable data for NASA as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its Artemis program for the first time since the last Apollo mission 52 years ago.\n\nNASA's Artemis program mission delayed\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon ahead of a moon landing itself a year later for Artemis III. But the Artemis program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues, including a battery flaw on the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the moon.\n\nOnce NASA is back on track in the years ahead, the agency intends to send a crew to the moon's south polar region, where it will will lay the groundwork for NASA to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of future missions to Mars.\n\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers and Mike Snider.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Fortunately for Intuitive Machines – and for NASA, the mission's primary customer – the lander maintained limited function even though its antennas were not pointed at Earth.\n\nMission controllers at the company rushed to gather as much data as they could, but they knew time was not on their side. Now, the energy-deprived spacecraft is expected to soon cease operating as its batteries drain and the sun moves across the sky away from its solar panels, Intuitive Machines said Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the company said the spacecraft had about 10 to 20 hours before losing contact.\n\nWhat caused the lunar spacecraft to land on its side?\n\nOdysseus was able to enter lunar orbit last Wednesday after separating from the SpaceX rocket, establishing communications with ground controller and powering onward to the moon.\n\nWhen it finally came time to attempt a landing Thursday evening, the spacecraft failed to land on its six legs and instead came down on its side.\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter later confirmed the precise location of Odysseus' landing site, which serves as the southernmost location where any craft has ever landed on the moon, Intuitive Machines said. Based on the orbiter's photos, Odysseus landed within about a mile of its intended target near the Malapert A crater, just 185 miles from the moon’s south pole.\n\nOfficials at Intuitive Machines believe that the craft landed too fast and may have caught one of its six landing pads in the lunar surface, forcing it to topple. The landing strut may also have snapped. The overturned lander covered some antennas and left others near the ground, delaying the rate at which data can be received on Earth, Intuitive Machines said.\n\nLander sends back photos, collects data before demise\n\nAs of Monday, Odysseus was still in communication with flight controllers in Houston and was able to beam back the first images from the lunar surface, Intuitive Machines said.\n\nFlight controllers intended to collect data until the lander's solar panels were no longer exposed to the sunlight and and the craft died, which was initially projected to be Tuesday morning, the company said. Even if it landed upright, Odysseus only had a week to operate on the surface before the long lunar night replaced the sun and brought in negative temperatures.\n\n“Flight controllers intend to collect data until the lander’s solar panels are no longer exposed to light,” Intuitive Machines posted Monday on social media site X.\n\nNASA sent cargo aboard Odysseus for its own moon missions\n\nAs the primary customer on the lunar mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon for its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies like Intuitive Machines to transport scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface.\n\nAmong the cargo were tools to test plume-surface interactions and measure both radio astronomy and space weather interactions with the lunar surface.\n\nNASA had hoped the scientific instruments would be able to collect valuable data as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program. Now that the mission was cut a few days short, it's unclear how much valuable intel NASA was able to receive.\n\n“This feat from Intuitive Machines, SpaceX, and NASA demonstrates the promise of American leadership in space and the power of commercial partnerships,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement a day after the landing. \"Further, this success opens the door for new voyages under Artemis to send astronauts to the Moon, then onward to Mars.”\n\nOdysseus made landing near moon's south pole\n\nThe uncrewed Odysseus spacecraft touched down late Thursday on the surface of the moon, one week after launching aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAppropriately named for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" the lander became the first built by a private company to make it to the moon. The landing also signaled America's return to the moon for the first time since NASA's Apollo program came to an end in 1972.\n\nIntuitive Machines built and operated Odysseus to carry cargo for NASA and other private customers to the lunar surface for its IM-1 mission. Formally called a Nova-C, the lander is a hexagonal cylinder with six legs that the space company has operated from a mission control center in Houston.\n\nIt landed near Malapert A, a small crater about 190 miles from the moon's south pole region where water ice is thought to be abundant.\n\nThe substance's presence would be vital as NASA looks to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of future missions to Mars. Water ice would not only sustain astronauts on the surface, but would also be be a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.\n\nThe landing came about a month after another U.S. company, Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology, attempted an uncrewed moon landing of its own with its Peregrine lander. However, the doomed mission encountered a critical fuel leak that ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days later.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Flight controllers feared the worst and raced against time to get as much data as they could before the energy-deprived Odysseus heaved its final gasp and went silent.\n\nBut concerns that the sideways landing spelled doom for the mission appear to have been for naught: As of Wednesday afternoon, Odysseus is still beaming back valuable intel and could have until roughly 8 p.m. EST to do so, Steve Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines, the company that built and operated the spacecraft, said at a news conference.\n\nBy gathering additional telemetry data from Odysseus, the team of flight controllers in Houston determined that the position in which the lander had fell wasn't quite so crippling. Instead of powering down by Wednesday morning as predicted, Odysseus is still alive and well.\n\nIn fact, Intuitive Machines hopes to wake Odysseus back up in about three weeks when the sun once again returns, offering some precious rays that may breathe life back into the lander.\n\n\"We've conducted a very successful mission to this point and we expect to go to the end of the mission as planned,\" Altemus said at the televised conference. \"It's just an incredible testament to how robust and beastly that little spacecraft is.\"\n\nHere's what officials at Intuitive Machines and NASA – the mission's primary customer – said Odysseus accomplished:\n\nEclipse Island, Moon Beach: These places on the solar eclipse path have the perfect names\n\nLander transmits data from scientific, commercial payloads\n\nIt was a mission of firsts for Odysseus, named for the hero of Homer's \"The Odyssey:\"\n\nFirst commercially-built lander to ever make it to the lunar surface;\n\nFirst American spacecraft to return to the moon since NASA's Apollo era ended in 1972;\n\nFirst private lander to transmit data back to Earth.\n\nWhile NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon ahead of its own lunar missions, commercial customers like Columbia Sportwear also paid for a spot for cargo aboard the uncrewed craft.\n\nFlight controllers have been able to successfully analyze data from all the commercial and scientific payloads aboard Odysseus. Additionally, data from the spacecraft's transit, descent, landing and time on the surface will also provide valuable intel to engineers to learn about what went well and what can be improved, Altemus said.\n\nIntuitive Machines encountered 11 total \"mission critical\" challenges along the way – including temporary communication delays and issues with drifting during burn maneuvers. But all those hiccups were quickly corrected, said Tim Crain, chief technology officer and co-founder of Intuitive Machines.\n\nNow, the company has a good understanding of the craft's liquid methane and liquid oxygen propulsion system in deep space, which is now flight-proven.\n\nOdysseus may be woken up in 3 weeks\n\nOdysseus beat the odds Thursday, accomplishing what its Pittsburgh-based competitor Astrobotic Technology could not when it landed on the moon about a week after it launched aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nAfter separating from the SpaceX rocket, it took the lander 48 minutes to reach its orbit before it established communication with ground control. The next day, it aced a crucial engine firing test and succeeded in orienting itself in the direction of the moon as it powered ahead.\n\nDisaster struck, though, when telemetry data seemed to indicate that the spacecraft failed to land on its six legs and instead came down on its side near Malapert A, a small crater about 190 miles from the moon's south pole region where water ice is thought to be abundant.\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter later confirmed the precise location of Odysseus' landing site, which serves as the southernmost location where any craft has ever landed on the moon, Intuitive Machines said.\n\nA photo taken Tuesday and successfully sent to Earth showed Odysseus' position on the lunar surface, Intuitive Machines said in a Wednesday mission update.\n\nAltemus said the team now believes Odysseus hit the lunar surface hard upon landing, sending it into a skid as the engines continued to fire. When they throttled down, Odysseus slowly tipped over at a 30 degree angle on what flight controllers now believe is a gentle slope.\n\nIt continues to generate solar power, but Altemus said Wednesday that the company will soon put Odysseus to sleep to conserve energy until the sun returns in two to three weeks. That's when Intuitive Machines will put to the test another question: Can the team once again establish a signal with Odysseus when the sun is once again illuminating the craft's solar panels?\n\nIM-1 mission lays groundwork for future trips to moon\n\nFor NASA, the mission has successfully laid the groundwork for the U.S. space agency to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nIntuitive Machines' IM-1 mission was part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. The space agency paid the company a whopping $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon, which they said yielded the valuable insights for which they hoped.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies like Intuitive Machines to transport scientific payloads on private robotic landers bound for the lunar surface.

Though the competition ended without a winner, SpaceIL persevered to make sure the lunar mission became a reality.\n\nUpon success of the mission, the lander would only stay about two days on the lunar surface, all the time taking pictures that it would be transmitting back to Earth. It will also be studying the moon's magnetic field for a joint Weizmann Insitiute – NASA experiment.\n\nPlans are to land Beresheet in Mare Serenitatis, a lunar region that supposedly contains \"magnetic anomalies,\" something SpaceIL wants to conduct further analysis on.\n\nGoals are for the Beresheet mission to inspire more Israelis to pursue STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — careers, as well as to educate the world on everything that goes into getting to the moon, according to SpaceIL's website.\n\nSuper snow moon: Spectacular photos of the super snow moon, the brightest of the year\n\nFourth country to touch down on the moon\n\nUp to this point, only three nations have landed on the lunar surface: the U.S., Russia and China.

Intuitive Machines will operate the mission from its Nova Control Center in Houston, where flight controllers will monitor the spacecraft's health, send commands and receive data.\n\nThe journey to the moon is expected to take about a week before Odysseus attempts on Feb. 22 to settle onto the lunar surface. If all goes to plan, it will become the first American spacecraft to touch down on the moon’s surface since the final Apollo mission in 1972.\n\n\"We carry with us the collective spirit of perseverance, fueled by the dedication and hard work of everyone on our team,” Intuitive Machines President and CEO Steve Altemus said in a statement ahead of the launch. “Their tireless efforts have brought us to this moment, where we stand on the precipice of history, humbled by the gravity of our mission, yet emboldened by the boundless possibilities that lie ahead.\"\n\nMoon mission comes weeks after failed Peregrine landing\n\nA successful mission would also make Intuitive Machines the first private company to ever land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon after previous efforts have failed.\n\nIn the United States, the Peregrine lander's doomed mission to the moon ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days after its Jan. 8 launch.\n\nShortly after the spacecraft designed and operated by Pittsburgh aerospace company Astrobotic separated from the United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, its propulsion began leaking a critical amount of propellant. Astrobotic attempted to salvage the mission by having its probe explore what it could of space, but the malfunction eventually forced the company to abandon its plan.\n\nThe lander may not have been able to touch down on the moon, but NASA still said scientists were able to gather important data on the \"interplanetary environment\" before it was sent on Jan. 18 plummeting to Earth, burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Peregrine lander's mission also drew highly-publicized scrutiny from the Navajo Nation, whose members objected to the human remains it carried on board bound for a lunar burial.\n\nNASA's interest in lunar missions\n\nIf a private company like Intuitive Machines can pull off the mission, it would open the door for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nBoth Odysseus and Peregrine are part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. With a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program. Among the cargo are tools to test plume-surface interactions and measure both radio astronomy and space weather interactions with the lunar surface.\n\nIntuitive Machines also is serving customers like Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, as well as sculptor Jeff Koons, who is sending up 125 inch-sized moon figurines in a see-through cube, according to reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nThe mission, and others like it ahead, is intended to pave the way for human exploration of the moon.\n\nNASA delayed plans for Artemis II until 2025, which is when a group of spacefarers could finally embark on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The mission would be the precursor to Artemis III years later, when another crew of astronauts will set out to land on the lunar surface itself.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Had famously dedicated a giant leap for mankind.\n\nA few days later, on Apollo 11’s long trip home from the Sea of Tranquility, 50 years ago, Neil Armstrong spoke directly to some of your neighbors.\n\nFrom a command module pointed toward a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, Armstrong first properly acknowledged the “giants of science who have preceded this effort.”\n\nNext, the first man on the moon, who’d watched the monumental effort unfold among the palms and mangroves of East Central Florida, who’d witnessed the widest variety of goal-oriented tasks the world had ever known, thanked the workers — from ditch diggers to engineers, from plumbers to rocket scientists, more than 400,000 in all.\n\n“We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you.”\n\nSome 3,000 of those workers were in Daytona Beach, working for General Electric. Hundreds of others from this area commuted south from Volusia County daily to Merritt Island and Cape Canaveral, working on the blossoming space center and launch pads. Many others worked and lived down there and eventually ended up in Volusia and Flagler counties.\n\nThis 50th anniversary celebration of man’s first landing on the moon — considered the most astounding accomplishment in the history of aviation, if not all of recorded history — has given those long-ago workers a chance to reflect on their roles in Neil Armstrong’s giant leap, a leap made possible by millions upon millions of small steps before it\n\n“It’s a thrill, really, just to have been a part of it,” says Ormond Beach’s Marvin Wonder, one of hundreds who represented Daytona Beach’s Local 295 of the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union at the Space Center and the Cape.\n\nTrial and error\n\nIn retrospect, the term “space race” seems quaint, perhaps even exciting. But post-World War II relations between the United States and Soviet Union carried a more ominous descriptive: Cold War. The space race was a byproduct, and despite its jaunty name, was thought by some to be a matter of life and death.\n\nThe ability to control the heavens was considered the way to control your national fate in the new age of atomic weaponry and spy satellites. And early on, the Soviets were flexing their muscles, most notably by sending the first human (Yuri Gagarin) into space, just three weeks before Alan Shephard took America there.\n\nThe U.S. was always playing catch-up in the early years. In the days of trial-and-error, the sun often set on error. The biggest disaster of the Apollo era was the launch-pad test for Apollo 1 in January 1967, when an electrical fire in the cabin claimed the lives of its three astronauts.\n\nBut the decade prior to that was awash in aborts and accidents with unmanned rockets like Polaris, Redstone and others. Two early-1959 Polaris rockets were destroyed just after launch when they began to behave erratically.\n\n“They had a list on a board where you came in to work, so you’d know if any launches were going up that day,” says Dow Graham, a retired electrician who began work in 1957, at age 18, at Cape Canaveral.\n\nGraham says he and co-workers would always find a good vantage point to watch a launch, but not for the reason we do today.\n\n“You did it back then so you knew which way to run,” he says with just a slight laugh.\n\nAfter each misstep, messes were cleaned up, literally and figuratively. Corrections were made. The mission continued, and as the 1960s arrived, a firm goal was put in place.\n\nGE comes to town\n\nIt’s hard to fathom in today’s political and bureaucratic climates, but things moved rapidly after President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 directive to put a man on the moon, and return him safely to Earth, by decade’s end.\n\nThe United States, Kennedy insisted, must catch up with the Soviets and pull ahead in the space race, and the moon would become the next finish line.\n\nMany of the country’s major industrial giants were tasked with the all facets of the job — Grumman, North American Aviation, Bendix, General Motors and on and on. Among them was General Electric, a New York State-based conglomerate with roots tracing back to the 1890s and Thomas Edison.\n\nGE would provide design engineering, manufacturing and the installation of ground support and test equipment. A big piece of this was called ACE — Acceptance Checkout Equipment, which, broadly, made sure everything was operating as designed.\n\nWhen you look at the old photos of mission specialists sitting behind banks of monitors, they might be sitting behind equipment built by GE.\n\nFor its role in the Apollo program, GE had a presence at Cape Canaveral and the space center on Merritt Island, which was originally called the Launch Operations Center (renamed for President Kennedy following his 1963 assassination). GE also had workers at NASA facilities in Texas (Houston), Alabama (Huntsville), California (Downey) and New York (Bethpage).\n\nThe headquarters for GE’s Apollo Systems Department needed to be close to NASA, and in 1962 Daytona Beach became GE’s Apollo-era home, with 500 workers originally sent here and, by 1966, the number was nearly 3,000.\n\nIt started in a building that’s now a shopping center anchored by Carrabba’s Italian Grill on International Speedway Boulevard, and soon grew to a seven-building “campus” where One Daytona now sits.\n\nAmong the first wave of GE workers to arrive in 1962 was a future mayor of Daytona Beach, Larry Kelly, who was 27 with a young family and more than happy to leave Binghamton, N.Y. But before long, he realized just how seriously everyone was taking the space race.\n\n“I worked my ass off,” says Kelly, who was among the local GE engineers building testing equipment for the ACE system. “They wanted it done quickly, and it had to be perfect. NASA not only put quality in what they were sending up to space, but quality in what we had on the ground. It was long, long hours ... 12-hour days.”\n\nMore than 50 years later, Kelly’s focus has changed from the work involved to the accomplishment achieved.\n\n“President Kennedy, he said we’re going to put a man on the moon. And boy, people were going to make it happen,” says Kelly, who was Daytona Beach’s mayor from 1974-93. “It motivated America. It was something similar to World War II; it was a motivation. You were devoted to making it happen.”\n\nAs the Apollo program leapt closer and closer to its 1969 crowning achievement, Jim Kotas joined GE and was assigned to its Kennedy Space Center operations. Now 73, in 1968 he was a fresh graduate of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, where he majored in electrical engineering.\n\n“GE called me and talked about a job in Utica (N.Y.). I wasn’t thrilled,” Kotas recalls. “Then they offered me a job at the Cape and I came down.”\n\nHe arrived in ’68, in time for Apollo 8 and the first manned launch of Apollo’s “chauffeur” — Saturn V, the mammoth Earth-rattling rocket that stood 36 stories high and weighed 6.5 million pounds.\n\n“That blew me away,” Kotas says of the handiwork of famed German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun. “It was so big. It cleared the tower so slowly and smoothly, it was beautiful.”\n\nBy 1969, Kotas would be reassigned to GE’s Daytona Beach complex, but during his year at NASA’s ground zero, he was fully aware that something very big was going on all around him.\n\n“I think, down at the Cape especially, you had a sense you were part of something much bigger than normal,” he says. “There’s so much going on. There are astronauts flying in, astronauts flying out. Walter Cronkite would set up his remote newscast out of the Hilton. You had this sense you’re into something bigger.”\n\nWally's words\n\nBill Rutherford, now 79 and living in Deltona, was an electrical instrumentation technician for the Bendix Corporation, commuting 52 miles daily from his Winter Park home to the Space Center from 1968-75.\n\nHe worked at NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Operations Building (MSOB), in the altitude chamber. He worked specifically on the water deluge system and, like the others, he worked a lot.\n\n“I was hired on Feb. 12 or something like that,” he says. “We didn’t have a day off until Thanksgiving. Once you got one spacecraft out of the chamber, they’d put another one right behind it.”\n\nRutherford’s job briefly put him in the company of NASA’s rock stars — the astronauts, including Apollo 11’s Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Early in his tenure, he was sent to fix a mechanical issue in the “suit room,” where astronauts put on their space suits for simulations. In walked three astronauts, in their space suits, and he says he was overwhelmed with awe.\n\nAmong them was Wally Schirra, one of NASA’s original seven astronauts and soon-to-be commander of Apollo 7. Rutherford says Schirra quickly noted his awestruck and nervous manner.\n\n“I was shaking like a leaf,” says Rutherford, who’s lived in Deltona since 1985. “Schirra motioned for me to come over. He had me help him loosen a strap on his suit. I started to walk away.\n\n“He stopped me. He looked down at my name badge and said, ‘Rutherford, let me give you a little advice. It doesn’t matter what your title is — President of the United States, bank president, or astronaut. We all put our trousers on one leg at a time.’ He patted me on the back and said, ‘Don’t you ever forget that.’ ”\n\nWork to do\n\nBefore there was Broadway, someone had to build the theaters. Before there was Apollo, someone had to build the space center.\n\n“Our local had 200 members, but I’d say we had 2,000 travelers coming through the local working down there,” says Graham, who’s now 81 and lives in Port Orange.\n\nLocal 296 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) practically had a conveyor belt of electricians commuting to Merritt Island and Cape Canaveral before and during the Apollo years. They weren’t alone. Carpenters, masons, lathers, painters — practically all of the trades — made the daily commute.\n\nJust south of Mason Avenue on North Beach Street, where it's still in operation, Daytona Beach’s Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 295 was a bustling place.\n\n“At the peak during the Apollo program,” Marvin Wonder says, “we probably had — just pipefitters — maybe 700 working out of this local. A contractor would call the local and say, ‘I need 20 men.’ And it had to be done right now.\n\n“For a couple of years when I was down there, they kept two crews of men just on stand-by. Everything had to be done right away. You could be sitting there twiddling your thumbs for two weeks, then all of a sudden you’re busting your butt 12 hours a day.”\n\nFor many, that eventually grew tiresome, and not just physically.\n\n“A lot of jobs worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week,” Wonder says. “Some of them had two 12-hour shifts, seven days a week. I kinda drew the line a little bit, because it dawned on me, my children were getting ready to start school, and we were like strangers.\n\n“I’m up at 4:30, 5 o’clock in the morning. Then don’t get home until late. They’re in bed when I leave, in bed when I get home.”\n\nThe commute\n\nThe daily commuters made their way south on U.S. 1 before veering left, south of Oak Hill, on Highway 3 to Merritt Island.\n\nToday, that two-lane road is smooth, comfortably wide enough for two-way traffic, and offers a scenic drive through native flora and fauna. But long-ago car-poolers, to a man, laugh and shudder at memories of that 15-mile stretch of narrow roadway that somehow got their assorted vehicles across Haulover Canal and to the NASA gates, and back again.\n\n“Not a good road,” says Graham. “Narrow. And potholes. And everybody drove about 90 miles an hour on that road. Then you get to Haulover and there’s a skinny drawbridge.”\n\nWonder, who did the same routine with fellow plumbers and pipefitters, points out the one good aspect of the old road.\n\n“Yeah, it was like a one-lane road, but thankfully all of the traffic was usually going in the same direction.”\n\nMany of the tradesmen in those days lived a modern cowboy’s lifestyle — some of them were far from home, here just for the work. And like the ranch hands of yore, many liked to blow off steam at quitting time.\n\n“Coming home, the first stop after we got through the gate was a little package store,” says Graham. “That was the first beer stop. Then at Haulover, they had a package store.\n\n“I remember riding with a bunch of ol’ linemen. We stopped and they got a bottle of whiskey, opened it and threw the cap out of the car window. I said, ‘what are you doing?’ The guy says, ‘We don’t put the cap back on our bottles of whiskey.’ The bottle made the rounds around the car. We get to Edgewater, another package store, same thing. Tossed the cap again.”\n\nIt was a different time.\n\n“The linemen, they were a great breed,” Graham says. “To me, I got to be a good union person by working with linemen. Linemen had to work together. Their lives depended on each other.”\n\nGiven such stories, naturally, there were some downsides.\n\n“Jimmy Ivanhoe had a bar just south of Edgewater (it’s now Riptides),” Wonder says. “That was a popular stop. There was a lot of that going on. When you’re working that many hours, you don’t have time to blow off much steam. Quite a few of them became alcoholics.”\n\nAnd not just that.\n\n“Gamblers, too,” laughs Brett Mirsky, current business manager of the Local 795. “I’ve seen some old telegrams in our files upstairs, saying you need to tell them to stop gambling out there. There’s no gambling allowed. The contractor would send our local a telegram.”\n\nThe launch\n\nAs the launch date for Apollo 11 approached, Jim Kotas insists, he had little anxiety. His engineer’s philosophy won out.\n\n“By Apollo 11, you think it’s all going to happen as planned,” he says. “Apollo 8 had gone around the moon, Apollo 9 had tested the lunar module. Apollo 10, they went to the moon, got into the LM, got close to the surface but didn’t land, just tested all the sequences.\n\n“So by the time you get to Apollo 11, you’re convinced everything is going to work because it’s been working fine.”\n\nLarry Kelly, at GE’s Daytona Beach plant, was a bit more nervous.\n\n“You’re thinking, ‘you’ve done a lot of space shots, but this is it, baby. This is it,’ ” he says. “You have a child due to be born. You’re waiting on him to be born. And then he’s born. It’s part of you … part of you. You feel good about it.”\n\nMarvin Wonder, the pipefitter, takes the bigger view.\n\n“You just knew that this is history,” he says. “About like Columbus sailing across the Atlantic Ocean.”\n\nHe also marveled, and still does, at the logistical miracle of it all.\n\n“There were people working on this all over the United States, putting pieces together and assembling the stuff, and it all came down here and got put in,” Wonder says. “To coordinate all that … just a monstrous task.”\n\nThanks from high above\n\nFour days after the launch, on July 20, Apollo 11’s lunar module touched down in the Sea of Tranquility. By then, Wonder had left Florida and was working on a project with a much different historical legacy — the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, site of a partial meltdown a decade later.\n\nIn a bit of irony for a man who was working at that future powder keg, Wonder watched on TV and marveled at the astronauts’ courage. Neil Armstrong and then Buzz Aldrin, farther from home than man had ever been, on a dusty moon, with no guarantees that their module would lift off properly, much less find and rejoin Michael Collins and the command module circling above the moon.\n\n“To be on that moon, with that capsule up there going around …” Wonder says with a shake of the head. “To be on the moon and wonder if you’re ever gonna get back on that capsule. It has to be in the back of your mind, you know?”\n\nJim Kotas had fully relocated to Daytona Beach’s GE headquarters, but his girlfriend and future wife (Kathy) lived near Cape Canaveral, as did a former co-worker, who owned the large, black-and-white TV he and Kotas had bought the previous year — “We pooled our money and bought it used,” Kotas recalls.\n\nThe three of them, along with the world, watched on that Sunday evening as Neil Armstrong prepared to leave the lunar lander and go down the ladder.\n\n“Yeah, I remember the excitement of just listening to them talk as he’s about to step down,” Kotas says.\n\nKotas’ years at GE, particularly his time on the Apollo project, attached a perfectionist’s attitude to his psyche. That might explain why he still points out that Armstrong’s first words upon touching the moon’s surface didn’t come across as intended due to spotty audio.\n\nArmstrong’s intended “one small step for a man” came out as “one small step for man.” Not a huge deal, some would suggest. Maybe even better, you could say. To Kotas, it seems, it’s at least one small shame.\n\n“He comes down,” Kotas says, “and he makes that famous misstatement, ‘one small step for man.’ ”\n\nOn the three-day return trip to Earth, Armstrong spoke again to a worldwide audience, using network audio capabilities that were revolutionary for the time. He thanked everyone — Everyone — who “put their hearts and abilities” into the success of that mission, and this time his words were clear and precise.\n\nSo were the words of command module pilot Michael Collins, who might have summed up the effort just as well, if not better, than his historic cohort.\n\n“We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly,” Collins said. “All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people ... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say thank you very much.”\n\nWith 50 years' distance between all the hard work and the historical significance, it seems now as if it was all a pleasure. No thanks necessary.\n\n“When you’re doing it,” says Larry Kelly, “I think you’re so busy, you don’t realize how it changed the world.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2022/12/11/orion-splashdown-completes-nasa-artemis-i-moon-mission/69711879007/", "title": "Return to Earth!

Touching down at 12:41 p.m. ET it marked the exclamation point of NASA's nearly month-long Artemis I test flight.\n\nIt all started at Kennedy Space Center in Florida with Orion's dramatic and spectacular night-illuminating launch atop NASA's 322-foot Space Launch System rocket on Wednesday, Nov. 16.\n\nSunday's conclusion came after Orion's lunar round trip spanning a total of 25 and a half days and about 1.4 million miles.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nDuring Sunday's operations NASA associate administrator, Cathy Koerner, said from the Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center, “there's a lot of energy in the room and it's very familiar, but it's also very different as we step into this next episode in human exploration.”\n\nCoincidentally, Orion's splashdown occurred on the 50th anniversary of the touchdown on the moon of NASA's last lunar mission, Apollo 17, according to NASA spokesperson Rob Navias.\n\nBill Nelson, NASA administrator, called it, \"a great day, not only for America, but it's a great day for all of our international partners.\"\n\n\"That's a difference from 50 years ago,\" Nelson told reporters on Sunday. \"Fifty years ago, we went as a country as a government today we go on with not only international partners but also commercial partners.\"\n\nHe called it the \"beginning of the new beginning.\"\n\nComing in hot & fast\n\nOrion punched through the atmosphere on a complex trajectory called a \"skip re-entry\" experiencing temperatures of about 5,000 degrees in the process. It then skipped back out of the upper reaches of the atmosphere alleviating some of the heat, speed, and g-forces.\n\nIt then plunged back in for the final descent. Traveling at about 300 mph, parachutes deployed to slow the spacecraft's descent to just 20 mph before splashing down and bobbing in the Pacific Ocean to await its retrieval by the landing and recovery team that was stationed nearby.\n\nChosen to avoid rough seas and winds associated with a cold front, the landing site off the coast of California near Guadalupe Island off Baja California was predetermined by Air Force weather specialists prior to the departure of the recovery team.\n\nThe primary recovery vessel the USS Portland, a U.S. Navy amphibious transport ship, and the landing and recovery team — comprised of about 95 people from the Navy, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and Lockheed Martin — deployed from San Diego, California on Wednesday, Dec. 7 to a holding position in the Pacific.\n\nAs of Florida Today's Sunday afternoon print deadline, NASA's team was preparing the capsule to be hauled aboard the recovery ship.\n\nJust before re-entry, the Orion crew module separated from the service module. It housed its engines and thrusters responsible for maneuvering the craft through space including its Orbital Maneuvering System engine, a piece of repurposed space shuttle hardware, which had previously flown 19 times.\n\nThe service module is designed to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere over a stretch of the Pacific Ocean routinely used for the safe disposal of junk space hardware. According to a NASA blog post, \"the Artemis I trajectory is designed to ensure any remaining parts do not pose a hazard to land, people, or shipping lanes.\"\n\nOther Orion hardware that was jettisoned during landing, including the forward bay cover and three main parachutes. Initially, it was planned for those items to be fished from the ocean by members of the recovery team. But before teams could retrieve them, they sunk under the surface of the ocean. The recovery of those assets was not a required objective.\n\nApollo 17:Last step, last words and long wait for lunar return\n\nSights set on the moon: NASA launches historic Artemis I mission from Florida\n\nRocket launch schedule: Upcoming Florida launches and landings\n\nOrion's Artemis I journey\n\nThe Artemis I journey to deep space and back pushed Orion's limits in every way imaginable.\n\nAlong the way, the spacecraft even broke decades-long records that were held over from NASA's Apollo era. Orion flew farther from Earth, punctured through the Earth's atmosphere faster, and experienced hotter re-entry temperatures than any other spacecraft ever designed for human spaceflight.\n\nThe last time a human-rated spacecraft flew anywhere close to Orion's newly set record of 268,563 miles away from our home planet, was in 1970 during NASA's Apollo 13 mission.\n\nOn November 25, Orion fired up its Orbital Maneuvering System engine to complete a maneuver called the distant retrograde insertion burn. It flung the capsule past the moon into an orbit about 40,000 miles away called a distant retrograde orbit meaning that Orion traveled in the opposite direction of the moon's orbit around the Earth.\n\nThe highly stable orbit was chosen to test Orion's capability to support future long-duration deep-space Artemis missions that will boast a crew of four astronauts beginning with Artemis II slated to occur in 2024.\n\nOrion's trek home began Thursday, Dec. 1, when it departed the distant lunar orbit where it had been for about a week. Then, on Monday, Dec. 5, it made a quick pitstop skirting less than 80 miles above the lunar surface to harness the moon's gravitational force and fling itself on a trajectory back to Earth.\n\nZebulon Scoville, NASA flight director, called it \"a tip of the hat and a historical nod to the past,\" as Orion sailed past the landing sites of the Apollo 12 and 14 missions but was too far away to capture any detailed imagery.\n\nWhat's next for NASA's Artemis?\n\nUnlike the cramped command and service modules of the Apollo era, Orion is designed to host long-duration astronaut missions to the moon and back. NASA hopes to utilize lessons learned during Artemis lunar missions as stepping stones to one day venture even further to Mars.\n\nWith the Artemis I mission complete and Orion safely back on Earth, the path is set for NASA to execute a similar mission in the form of Artemis II. Though the mission profile looks similar to Artemis I, it will include astronauts. Orion will also be outfitted with crew seats and life support systems to test out its capability to support long-duration human missions to the moon.\n\nThen, before 2030, Artemis III — a much more complex endeavor involving NASA's Space Launch System rocket, Orion crew capsule, and SpaceX's Super Heavy Starship vehicle which is currently still in development — will aim to deliver two astronauts, the first woman and the first person of color, to the lunar surface.\n\nThe lucky astronauts who will round out the complement of four have yet to be announced publicly. Whether or not they have been selected and are in training for the mission, is for NASA to know and the rest of the world to find out.\n\nVanessa Wyche, NASA director of the Johnson Space Center told reporters Sunday, \"our intent, if all is good to go and everything looks good, is to name the (Artemis II) crew in early 2023.\"\n\n\"We're looking very much forward to that,\" she said.\n\nNASA's Artemis program is designed to enable an extended human presence on the moon. Eventually, the agency hopes to establish a permanent base there supported by a crewed space station that will orbit the moon called Gateway.\n\nOne day, NASA plans to use the moon as a pit stop on the way to Mars.\n\nJamie Groh is a space reporter for Florida Today.

It also included PVH Corp., the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein, and U.S. biotech company Illumina, on its \"unreliable entities list,\" a designation that can damage a firm's competitiveness by subjecting it to fines and making it harder for foreign employees to get visas. China's commerce ministry accused the firms of \"discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises,\" without elaborating.\n\nAs part of Trump's executive orders imposing tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, he also halted the \"de minimis\" trade loophole that allows low-value packages to come in duty-free from China and other countries, Reuters reported. Retailers Shein and Temu may raise prices, as together they account for more than 30% of packages shipped to the U.S. under \"de minimis,\" according to Reuters. The U.S. Postal Service announced it will continue accepting all inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong from Feb. 5, quickly reversing the suspension that went into effect Feb. 4.\n\nRead more: China hits back with levies on US products after Trump's tariffs take effect\n\nHow many imported goods will be impacted in the US?\n\nThe U.S. relies heavily on goods from Canada, China and Mexico, which accounted for 40% of all our imports in recent years.\n\nIf the proposed tariffs on goods from Mexico take effect, Americans may have to pay more for certain fruits, vegetables and alcohol products. Tariffs on Canadian goods could lead to higher prices for steel, lumber and grains.\n\nHow could these tariffs affect you? What industries will be most affected?\n\nAs the prices rise on imported goods, the price of domestic goods may also rise due to reduced competition. There could also be a scarcity of imported goods because they may become too expensive to import. Jobs in industries that rely on imported goods, like automotive manufacturing and residential construction, could also face losses. Some of the hardest-hit sectors include toys, fuel, transportation, electronics, footwear, and food.\n\nUSA TODAY analyzed the trade data published by the U.S. Census Bureau and looked at trade values across commodity sectors based on classifications from a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nA staggering 74% of U.S. imports of toys and sports equipment came from China ‒ so did 40% of imported footwear and headgear. Even when toys are designed in the U.S., most of them are manufactured in China. Eight out of 10 toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group based in New York City.\n\nElectronics ‒ a category of goods already experiencing high tariff rates ‒ may face even greater impacts, with 44% of imports coming from China and Mexico combined.\n\nCanada supplied 51% of the U.S.'s imported fuel and, together with Mexico, supplied 44% of the U.S.’s imported vegetable products, making these essential commodities potential flashpoints for rising costs. According to the Congressional Research Service, Canada and Mexico accounted for over 71% of U.S. crude oil imports, with Canada alone contributing nearly 60%. Crude oil is liquid petroleum extracted directly from the earth and can be used for burning as fuel or for processing into chemical products.\n\nHere's a list of the top product categories imported into the U.S. from each country threatened with tariffs:\n\nMexico\n\n◾ Transportation equipment (32%)\n\n◾ Vegetable products (28% by itself and 44% combined with Canada)\n\n◾ Prepared food (22% by itself and 42% combined with Canada)\n\n◾ Machinery (21%)\n\n◾ Electronics (18% )\n\nChina\n\n◾ Toys (74%)\n\n◾ Footwear and headgear (40%)\n\n◾ Electronics (25% by itself and 44% combined with Mexico)\n\n◾ Textiles and clothing (25%)\n\n◾ Hides and skins (21%)\n\nCanada\n\n◾ Fuel (51%)\n\n◾ Wood products (39%)\n\n◾ Animal products (23%)\n\n◾ Metals (21%)\n\n◾ Mineral products (21%)\n\nCONTRIBUTING Kim Hjelmgaard, Kinsey Crowley and Shawn J.

From gas to alcohol to meat and more, economists expect Americans to pay higher prices.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nA costly endeavor for everyday Americans\n\nAccording to a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta study, the tariffs imposed by Trump “could raise consumer prices on everyday retail purchases, such as food and beverage items and general merchandise, covering about a quarter of the total consumption basket, by 0.81 percent to 1.63 percent.”\n\nThe price hikes are expected to impact outside of the grocery store. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the tariffs could cost the average United States household $1,200 annually.\n\n“Domestic producers that compete with the newly tariffed imports will increase their prices in line with import price increases,” the institute said.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tax Policy Center said that after-tax income would fall by $930 on average next year. The center said that the lowest-income 20% of households would lower after-tax income by $170 while wealthier households could see an average of $3,280 less in a year.\n\nWhat items from Canada could be impacted by Trump’s tariffs?\n\nThe following common imports from Canada to the U.S., according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics, could be affected by Trump’s tariffs:\n\nWood\n\nCharcoal\n\nAluminum\n\nIron and steel appliances\n\nCereal, flour, starch and milk products\n\nRubbers\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\nCarpets and other textile floor coverings\n\nWool, animal hair, horsehair yarn and fabric\n\nUmbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips\n\nCotton\n\nPhotographic or cinematographic goods\n\nCork products\n\nPrinted books\n\nWhat items from Mexico could be impacted by Trump’s tariffs?\n\nItems the U.S. imports from Mexico, according to Trading Economics and the OEC, that could be affected by Trump’s tariff plan include:\n\nCereals\n\nPaper products\n\nProcessed fruits and nuts\n\nTropical fruits\n\nTomatoes, onions, lettuce and cabbage\n\nPickled foods\n\nFruit juice\n\nFertilizers\n\nDairy products, eggs and honey\n\nCotton\n\nBeer and hard liquor\n\nCoffee, tea, mate and spices\n\nMeat, fish and seafood\n\nSauces and seasonings\n\nBaked goods\n\nAvocados\n\nRaw sugar\n\nMore expensive food and drinks amid a cost of living crisis\n\nIn a poll by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, about 40% of voters viewed the economy and jobs as their top issue, finding that young voters prioritizing the economy were more likely to vote for Trump.\n\nConsumer prices increased 3% in January from a year earlier, up from 2.9% the previous month, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index.\n\nNow, Trump is set to increase prices even further with the tariffs implemented on Tuesday. Canada and Mexico are the United States’ largest trading partners; a significant amount of meat, grains, and vegetables are imported from these countries.\n\nAccording to the Canadian government, about 34% of all meat imported into the U.S. comes from the country. On the other hand, according to the USDA, Mexico is a major provider of fresh vegetables to the U.S., as 77% of our fresh produce comes from the South.\n\nMexico and Canada rank within the top four providers of alcohol for Americans. Mexico, in fact, is the largest importer of beer into the United States, as 18% of all beer drank in America comes from Mexico, the U.S. Beer Institute said.\n\nPricier gas and cars\n\nTrump originally proposed a 10% tariff on Canadian oil, which equates to a roughly 16 cent increase per gallon, according to Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist.\n\nThese tariffs could eventually raise the price of almost everything because companies need fuel to transport their products across the country. Retaliatory actions by the three U.S. trade partners are also likely to stir up trouble for American companies.\n\n“This is a mess,” Skordeles said. “There are so many unintended consequences.”\n\n“You might see prices go up not just for new cars but for used ones, too, as any additional scarcity in the market often drives more would-be new shoppers to consider used cars,” Cars.com’s Stef Schrader told USA TODAY. “Cars that depend heavily on imported parts or are fully imported from the affected countries will likely see price hikes first.”\n\nContributing: USA TODAY's Rachel Barber and Joey Garrison; Reuters\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Tariffs on energy imports from Canada were set at a lower rate of 10%, a White House official said, to minimize the potential for disruptions in gasoline and home heating prices.\n\nThe global financial markets are expected to kick off Monday after America's two top trading partners, Canada and Mexico, vowed immediate retaliation, and China is considering \"countermeasures,\" according to Reuters.\n\nTariffs have been central to Trump’s economic strategy, and part of an attempt to increase tax revenue and protect jobs. He has also used them as a negotiating tool, threatening tariffs against countries as a way to achieve a myriad of policy concessions.\n\nMexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum denounced the tariffs and lashed out at Trump’s suggestion that the Mexican government was collaborating with drug traffickers.\n\nIf the U.S. wanted to address the serious consumption of fentanyl, they could “combat the sale of narcotics on the streets of their main cities, which they do not do,” according to a Google translation of her post on X.\n\n“Problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs, but by talking and dialoguing,” she added.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to the U.S. trade action with 25% tariffs of its own against $155 billion worth of American goods.\n\nThat includes immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days, he said.\n\nTrump’s action will not only harm Canadians but will have “real consequences” for the American people, said Trudeau. “(It) will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American auto assembly, plants and other manufacturing facilities,” he said. “They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery store and gas at the pump.”\n\nThis move will also obstruct access to materials crucial for U.S. security, such as nickel uranium, steel and aluminum, he said.\n\nDecision time for Trump on tariffs: Will the U.S. president seek revenue or revenge?\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in response to a previous inquiry on the tariffs, embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said, \"China will also firmly defend its own interests.\"\n\nTrump also noted in his executive orders that if the targeted countries retaliate against the tariffs imposed, he \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this Executive Order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"\n\nTrump weighing a universal tariff\n\nTrump is also debating a universal tariff and fees on the European Union but has not specified how much they would be and did not impose them on Saturday. He told reporters Friday that he was looking to hike tariffs on steel, aluminum, and eventually, copper. Tariffs on pharmaceuticals and computer chips are also on their way, he said.\n\nHe also vowed a blanket tariff on oil and gas imports by Feb. 18.\n\n\"We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all,\" Trump said in a social media post on Saturday announcing the tariffs. \"I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection says it seized 27,023 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2023, which was nearly double the 14,700 pounds of fentanyl the agency says it took into its possession in 2022.\n\nFentanyl overdoses caused an estimated 74,702 deaths in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, down slightly from an estimated 76,226 deaths in 2022.\n\n\"The tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China send a powerful message that the United States will no longer stand by as other nations fail to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants into our country,\" House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said a statement.\n\nThe chairman of the House's tax-writing committee said the U.S. must \"use all available tools including tariffs\" to fight drug trafficking and fentanyl distribution.\n\nCanada and Mexico are the top sources of U.S. crude imports, together accounting for around one-quarter of the oil U.S. refiners process into fuels such as gasoline and heating oil, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIn 2022, Canada accounted for 60% of crude oil imports to the U.S., while 10% of crude oil came from Mexico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nRefineries purchase crude oil to produce gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products.\n\nEconomists have long warned that tariffs – duties on imports – will boost inflation and hurt consumers. Trump and his advisers have dismissed those concerns, pointing to data that shows inflation was low in his first term, even after he put duties on certain nations and products.\n\n\"Tariffs don't cause inflation. They cause success,\" Trump said on Friday. \"There could be some temporary short-term disruption, and people will understand that.\"\n\nDemocrats accused him of waging a trade war in statements responding to his tariffs on Saturday, in which they took issue with Trump imposing a higher rate of duties on U.S. allies Mexico and Canada than he did on competitor nation China.\n\n\"While China is stealing our technology and actively undermining American industry, Trump is cracking down more than twice as hard on maple syrup and avocados from Canada and Mexico. How does that make sense?\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a post on X.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rand Paul also raised concerns about the potential inflationary effect of the tariffs on the social media platform. \"Tariffs are simply taxes. Conservatives once united against new taxes. Taxing trade will mean less trade and higher prices.\"\n\n\"We won the last election by complaining about Democrats' policies, which gave us high prices. Tariff lovers will be forced to explain the persistence of high prices,\" Paul, a libertarian from Kentucky, said.\n\nTrump relies on national emergency authority to impose tariffs\n\nThe White House said Saturday that Trump was utilizing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada.\n\nIEEPA gives the president authority to deal with any \"unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"\n\nTrump said his administration determined that the \"sustained influx of illicit opioids and other drugs\" was enough to trigger the authority, which the White House said would not be lifted until it determined that the crisis had been alleviated.\n\nIn a statement, Reps. Suzan DelBene of Washington and Don Beyer of Virginia, two Democratic lawmakers who have introduced legislation seeking to restrict Trump's ability to unilaterally levy tariffs, accused him of a \"blatant abuse of executive power.\"\n\n\"Congress must reassert its authority by reining in this egregious misuse of the law,\" the lawmakers said.\n\nThe tariffs could prompt legal action, with parties arguing that Trump is not using the authority the way Congress intended, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the economics program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former undersecretary of commerce for export administration.\n\nBut he said, \"The reality is, the bar for what constitutes the emergency has gotten pretty low over the years, so I think he gets away with it.\"\n\nIn the first of the orders to be published, Trump officially threatened to expand tariffs against Canada, if the country sought to retaliate.\n\n\"Should Canada retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on United States exports to Canada or similar measures, the President may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action,\" the order said.\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Francesca Chambers are White House Correspondents for USA TODAY.

The tariffs would be proportional to the tariffs individual countries place on imported American goods.\n\n“We don't want it to hurt other countries, but they've been taking advantage of us for years and years and years,\" he said. \"They've charged us and we haven't charged them. And it's time to be reciprocal.”\n\nIn 2024, 23% of all steel used in the U.S. was imported, with Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam as the largest suppliers, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump paused 25% tariffs he’d planned to impose on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after the countries’ leaders promised to step up their efforts to improve border security.\n\nWithin hours of Trump’s Saturday order, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back with tit-for-tat retaliatory 25% tariffs on American goods. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she was considering \"tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests.\"\n\nTrump, who has called himself “Tariff Man,” said the move was to force the countries to stem the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the borders and into the U.S.\n\nTariffs have been central to Trump’s economic strategy, leaning on them to increase revenue and protect jobs. He also views them as tools to aid negotiations with various countries.\n\nRoughly half of all aluminum used in the U.S. is imported, with most of it coming from Canada. At 3.2 million tons last year, Canadian imports were twice the next nine countries combined, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that he wanted the countries to \"balance out their trade, No. 1.\"\n\nAccording to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Canada was $80.1 billion in 2022, a 68% increase over 2021. Meanwhile, the trade deficit with Mexico stood at $131.1 billion in 2022, a 24% increase over 2021.\n\nEconomists have warned that the tariffs could raise prices for American consumers. Trump did not dispute that assertion, saying Americans could feel some \"short-term pain\" from the emerging trade war.\n\n\"But long term, the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world,\" he said, adding that the U.S. had trade deficits with \"almost\" every country.

But he soon backed off, exempting the auto industry for a month from the 25% tax and then expanded that to cover any product covered by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.\n\nThe temporary pauses followed leaders from Mexico, Canada, and China all vowing to take retaliatory action.\n\n\"They're going to have to have a tariff.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMexico, China, and Canada make counter-moves\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico had taken \"decisive actions\" to stop fentanyl from crossing the U.S. southern border during a 30-day pause on tariffs and that there was no \"reason, rationale or justification\" behind Trump's decision. Sheinbaum said Mexico would announce its retaliation plans on Sunday.\n\nChina's response was immediate. It announced 10% to 15% additional tariffs on American agriculture exports and placed new investment restrictions on 25 U.S. firms. A Chinese commerce military spokesperson called Trump's tariffs \"blackmail\" and said the country has long been committed to addressing the opioid epidemic.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Ottawa would launch 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of American exports to Canada, including orange juice, peanut butter, and beer. He also threatened tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion worth of American exports if Trump does not lift U.S. tariffs on Canada within 21 days.\n\nWhat items will cost more for American consumers?\n\nTariffs are likely to disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of transportation which will lead to a rise in price for almost everything, Truist head of U.S. economics Mike Skordeles, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Broadly speaking, higher tariffs will increase import costs, forcing companies to choose between absorbing the hit to their margins or passing it on to consumers,\" Madhav Durbha, a supply chain expert and group vice president of consumer packaged goods and manufacturing at RELEX, said in an email to USA TODAY. \"Either way, this creates inflationary pressure and dampens consumer spending, impacting not only individual companies but the broader market.\"\n\nBut while prices are expected to increase across the board, some items will see a price bump more quickly than others. For instance, consumers are likely to pay more for perishable foods sooner than they will pay more for their cars.\n\nAs previously reported, the following common imports from Canada to the U.S., according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics, could be affected by Trump's tariffs:\n\n◾Wood\n\n◾Charcoal\n\n◾Aluminum\n\n◾Iron and steel appliances\n\n◾Cereal, flour, starch and milk products\n\n◾Rubber\n\n◾Alcoholic beverages\n\n◾Carpets and other textile floor coverings\n\n◾Wool, animal hair, horsehair yarn and fabric\n\n◾Umbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips\n\n◾Cotton\n\n◾Photographic or cinematographic goods\n\n◾Cork products\n\n◾Printed books\n\nItems the U.S. imports from Mexico, according to Trading Economics and the Observatory of Economic Complexity, that could be affected by Trump's tariff plan include:\n\n◾Cereals\n\n◾Paper products\n\n◾Processed fruits and nuts\n\n◾Tropical fruits\n\n◾Tomatoes, onions, lettuce and cabbage\n\n◾Pickled foods\n\n◾Fruit juice\n\n◾Fertilizers\n\n◾Dairy products, eggs and honey\n\n◾Cotton\n\n◾Beer and hard liquor\n\n◾Coffee, tea, mate and spices\n\n◾Meat, fish and seafood\n\n◾Sauces and seasonings\n\n◾Baked goods\n\n◾Avocados\n\n◾Raw sugar\n\nCommon imports to the U.S. from China, according to Trading Economics and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that could be affected by Trump's tariff plan include:\n\n◾Fish and crustaceans\n\n◾Vegetable fats and oils\n\n◾Vegetables (especially corn), fruit and nuts\n\n◾Soaps, lubricants, waxes, candles, modeling pastes\n\n◾Cereal, flour, starch, wheat and milk products\n\n◾Coffee, tea and spices\n\n◾Sugar\n\n◾Cocoa\n\n◾Dairy products, eggs, honey and edible products\n\n◾Vinegar\n\n◾Apple juice\n\n◾Garlic\n\nReuters contributed to this report.

In a post on Truth Social, he said he wants Canada and Mexico to do more to stop migrants and fentanyl from coming into the U.S. He also said he would impose another 10% tariff on top of the tariffs already in place on Chinese goods.\n\nBut economists have warned that tariffs could harm the economy. Here is what to know about the tax on imports:\n\nTariffs and your wallet: Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada could raise the prices of these goods\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nA tariff is a form of tax imposed on imports from another country. The business buying goods from another country pays the additional fee, but many experts agree the extra costs get passed onto consumers.\n\nEconomic theory generally shows higher trade barriers raise consumer prices and negatively impact economic output and income, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit.\n\nExperts say the argument for tariffs is to increase demand for domestic manufacturers, even though they are also part of the global supply chain that could be impacted by tariffs. National security is also an argument for using tariffs to ensure domestic production.\n\nTrump tried tariffs in his first term\n\nTrump waged a trade war in his first term, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese-made goods. The two countries eventually signed a trade deal that was meant to lead to more trade talks down the line. Those plans were thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Trump often criticized the Biden administration on trade, President Joe Biden kept many of Trump's tariffs in place and increased tariffs on targeted items such as Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nWhile campaigning, Trump floated this 25% tariff on Mexico he is now vowing to carry out, but only if the country would not help mitigate immigration to the U.S. southern border. He also suggested a 10-20% tariff on all goods and a 60% tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nThose would mean average tariff rates at highs not seen since the Great Depression, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nExperts wary of tariffs' impact on consumers\n\nMore than 10 analyses show Trump's proposed tariffs altogether would have a harmful effect on the American economy, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe Tax Foundation analysis found the tariffs together add up to $79 billion, which theoretically leads to an additional $625 in taxes annually for the average U.S. household. The Tax Foundation also argues the tariffs would raise prices while reducing output and employment.\n\nEstimates put the tariffs' possible impact on consumers in perspective:\n\nThe National Retail Federation projected $7,600 in additional costs per U.S. household annually if Trump's tariffs are imposed.\n\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics a middle-income family could pay an estimated $1,700 more a year.\n\nTrump says he would deploy these tariffs as a strategy to fight illegal immigration, drugs and crime.\n\n“This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem.

Trump has also said that next month he will impose worldwide tariffs on any country that taxes the import of U.S. goods.\n\nHere's some key points to know:\n\nWhy is Michigan so vulnerable to these tariffs?\n\nMichigan sees billions in imports from both countries, as well as from China, which Trump hit with an additional 10% tariff on top of the 10% tariff he had already imposed. From Canada, Michigan imports billions of dollars worth of oil and gas, as well as iron, steel and machinery. Mexico provides billions worth of electrical equipment and components. And like other states, Michigan gets dairy and lumber from Canada and agricultural products from Mexico.\n\nBut the real hit is to the auto industry, which is vital to Michigan's overall economy, and the domestic auto companies' counting on a supply line that sees components crossing borders many times on the way to vehicles' final assembly. If those parts and pieces are taxed every time they cross a border, it could add as much as $9,000 or more to the cost of many popular vehicles. That, in turn, could slow sales and lead to plant closures and layoffs.\n\nIt's not just the auto sector that could be hit, however. Already, there have been reports that Michigan farmers could be forced to pay more for supplies, as tariffs hit providers of plant nutrients, for example. Nationally, too, there have already been indications that Trump's tariffs are souring consumer sentiment, which could further result in people buying less, potentially sparking an economic downturn.\n\nWhy is Trump imposing tariffs?\n\nIn the cases of Canada, Mexico and China, which are the nation's largest trading partners, Trump argues that illegal drugs from China, namely fentanyl, are pouring across the Northern and Southern borders into the U.S., killing people.\n\nWhen he first announced the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he also said those countries weren't doing enough to stem illegal immigration, but he has largely dropped that as a reason with numbers of undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. declining.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection statistics show that of all the illegal drugs captured by authorities in the last fiscal year, 275,000 pounds came across the Southern border, compared to less than 12,000 pounds that came across the Northern border. But Trump still maintains drugs are the reason he's targeting Canada as well as Mexico.\n\nTrump has made comments, including on Monday, that suggest the real reason he's pushing tariffs is his belief that the U.S. has been taken advantage of by other countries that level tariffs against American goods or otherwise manipulate their currency or have tax systems that make it harder for the U.S. to compete worldwide, leading to trade deficits. \"Tariffs are easy, they're fast, they're efficient and they bring fairness,\" he said Monday.\n\nTrump has also argued that by raising tariffs, companies will relocate manufacturing to the U.S. and there is some evidence that is happening: This week, Honda announced it would start making its popular Civic model in Indiana and Trump announced a $100 billion investment by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple last month announced it would spend $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.\n\nHow are other countries responding?\n\nCanada, Mexico and China are America's three largest trading partners, meaning much of what is imported into the U.S. is now facing additional taxes (though Trump's tariffs on energy from Canada is 10% not 25%). Economists say those additional levies are ultimately passed on to customers, raising prices. Meanwhile, other countries are expected to respond by raising their own tariffs on American goods in retaliation.\n\n'On Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the Trump tariffs unjustified and said his country would enact tariffs on billions of dollars worth of American exports to his country, including cars, steel and other products. The Chinese government also responded to Trump's tariffs by adding taxes on American food imports including chicken, pork and beef, a move expected to hit American farmers.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Some grocery store items also make their way over to the states.\n\nAccording to Trading Economics and the (OEC), items imported to the U.S. from Mexico that could be affected by Trump's tariff plan include:\n\nCereals\n\nPaper products\n\nProcessed fruits and nuts\n\nTropical fruits\n\nTomatoes, onions, lettuce and cabbage\n\nPickled foods\n\nFruit juice\n\nFertilizers\n\nDairy products, eggs and honey\n\nCotton\n\nBeer and hard liquor\n\nCoffee, tea, mate and spices\n\nMeat, fish and seafood\n\nSauces and seasonings\n\nBaked goods\n\nAvocados\n\nRaw sugar\n\nWhat grocery store items from Canada could be impacted by Trump's tariffs?\n\nIn 2022, Canada exported $438 billion to the U.S., with the main products being crude petroleum ($117 billion), cars ($27 billion) and petroleum gas ($22.4 billion), the OEC said.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics, the main grocery store items that are imported from the U.S. to Canada, and could be affected by Trump's tariff plan, include:\n\nWood\n\nCharcoal\n\nAluminum\n\nIron and steel appliances\n\nCereal, flour, starch and milk products\n\nRubbers\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\nCarpets and other textile floor coverings\n\nWool, animal hair, horsehair yarn and fabric\n\nUmbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips\n\nCotton\n\nPhotographic or cinematographic goods\n\nCork products\n\nPrinted books\n\nContributing: Savannah Kuchar & Michael Collins, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/04/trump-mexico-canada-china-united-states-tariffs/81294660007/", "title": "Trump tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China kick in as tensions rise", "text": "Canada and China swiftly announced retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. on Tuesday, shortly after long-threatened levies by the Trump administration on those countries and Mexico took effect.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada were imposed at 12:01 a.m. ET, along with a doubling of duties on some Chinese goods to 20%.\n\nTrump's moves effectively launched new trade conflicts with the United States' top three trading partners and threatened to upend two-way annual trade worth nearly $2.2 trillion in 2024, according to data from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The tit-for-tat tariffs have rattled global markets.\n\nTrump has accused all three countries of not doing enough to clamp down on drugs like the opioid fentanyl entering the U.S. He also says tariffs will boost U.S. manufacturing and prevent other countries from taking American jobs.\n\nJoint address: Donald Trump to address Congress amid growing pessimism about the economy\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports and on another $86.2 billion if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days. He has said Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice.\n\n\"Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,\" Trudeau said. He added that they would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump in his first term.\n\nChina immediately countered the U.S. duties with 10% to 15% tariffs on some U.S. agricultural product imports.\n\nIn a news conference in Mexico City, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that there was \"no justification\" for Trump's tariffs and that they were imposed \"despite our work against gangs and fentanyl.\" Sheinbaum said she plans to announce Mexico's retaliatory tariffs and other measures against the U.S. on Sunday.\n\nTariffs are essentially taxes charged on goods imported from another country. They are typically set at a percentage of the goods' value and usually paid by the importer. The extra costs are generally passed on to the consumer.\n\nCanada and Mexico have enjoyed a virtually tariff-free trading relationship with the U.S. for three decades.\n\nDoubling China's tariffs\n\nThe extra 10% duty on Chinese goods adds to a 10% tariff imposed by Trump in February to punish Beijing over the fentanyl epidemic in the U.S. The 20% duty comes on top of tariffs of up to 25% imposed by Trump in his first term.\n\nSome of these products saw U.S. tariffs increase sharply under President Joe Biden, including a doubling of duties on Chinese semiconductors to 50% and a quadrupling of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to more than 100%.\n\nThe 20% tariff will apply to several major U.S. consumer electronics imports from China that had been untouched by duties, including smartphones, laptops, video game consoles, smartwatches, speakers and Bluetooth devices.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said Tuesday that its new levies, which take effect next Monday, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, and a 10% tariff on soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, and dairy and fish products.\n\n“The unilateral tariff increase by the U.S. harms the multilateral trade system, increases the burden on American businesses and consumers, and undermines the foundation of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation,” China’s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement.\n\nBeijing also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new tariffs, as it did in response to the earlier 10% tariff the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods.\n\nRecession fears\n\nSome business leaders said the tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products could have much deep repercussions for a highly integrated North American economy that depends on cross-border shipments to build cars and machinery, refine energy and process agricultural goods.\n\n\"Today's reckless decision by the U.S. administration is forcing Canada and the U.S. toward recessions, job losses and economic disaster,\" Canadian Chamber of Commerce CEO Candace Laing said in a statement.\n\nShe said the U.S. tariffs will fail to usher in a \"golden age\" coveted by Trump but instead raise costs for consumers and producers and disrupt supply chains.\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on the American people,\" Laing said.\n\nEven before Trump's tariffs announcement, U.S. data on Monday showed factory gate prices jumped to a nearly three-year high, indicating the new wave of tariffs could soon undercut production. Factory gate prices reflect the price of goods or services before any taxes, shipping or other fees are added.\n\nTrump's confirmation Tuesday that the tariffs would go ahead sent financial markets sharply lower as global stocks tumbled and safe-haven bonds rallied. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso fell against the greenback.\n\nEconomists at Capital Economics, a financial consultancy, wrote in investor notes Tuesday that if the U.S. tariffs remain in place, they risk plunging Canada and Mexico into recession and slowing global growth more generally.\n\nWhere to expect rising prices: Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico go into effect on Tuesday\n\nTariff actions at a blistering pace\n\nTrump has maintained a blistering pace of tariff actions since taking office in January, including fully restoring 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that take effect March 12, revoking earlier exemptions.\n\nTrump's \"America First\" agenda, aimed at redrawing trade relationships in favor of the U.S., was expected to be a centerpiece of his address Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress.\n\nLook right, look left: Trump will survey a landscape transformed in speech to Congress\n\nOn Saturday, Trump opened a national security investigation into imports of lumber and wood products that could result in steep tariffs. Canada, already facing 14.5% U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber, would be hit particularly hard.\n\nA week earlier, Trump revived an inquiry into countries that levy digital services taxes, proposed fees of up to $1.5 million on every Chinese-built ship entering a U.S. port, and launched a tariff investigation into copper imports.\n\nThese add to his plans for higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" to match the levies of other countries and offset their other trade barriers, a move that could hit the European Union economic bloc.\n\nRobert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, said in a statement that the 27 nations that make up the EU would not be pushed around by Trump if he imposes tariffs on their products.\n\n\"We will react with unity and self-confidence,\" he said.\n\nAnd Trudeau, Canada's leader, said it was the wrong strategy.\n\n“Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\" he said.\n\nIn Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that if the U.S. \"persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/02/03/trump-tariffs-impact-on-prices-savings/78183336007/", "title": "How will Trump's tariffs hit your wallet?

Meanwhile, there's been a reprieve of one-month or more for 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico from the Trump administration.\n\nBut as things change quickly around potential implementation of tariffs on imported goods, U.S. consumers have been worrying and preparing for the hit to their wallets and retailers have been scrambling to figure out how to plan for the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China.\n\nTariffs have been a focus for US retailers\n\nEveryone was buzzing about tariffs at a Washington, D.C., event with major U.S. retailers in early December. Then President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico had, at that point, been well established.\n\n\"We exclusively talked about this topic of tariffs,\" Balika Sonthalia, a partner and practice leader of strategic operations, Americas, at global strategy and management consultancy firm Kearney, told USA TODAY.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIn addition to immigration policies, tariffs have retailers worried that “the combination of the two can put a lot of sectors in between a rock and a hard place,” she said. And with Trump repeatedly vowing tariffs were coming – and doubling down in early January after the Washington Post reported he might scale them back – U.S. retailers and consumers weren't waiting to prepare.\n\nRetailers are trying to learn “what exactly they are walking into,” said Sonthalia, whose specialty for Kearney is consumer products and retail and distribution clients.\n\nHere's the latest on Trump tariffs\n\nOn Trump's first full day in office, as previously reported by USA TODAY, the president said he would levy a blanket duty of 25% on both Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1 unless the U.S. neighbors toughen security at their borders. Trump said both nations have illegal migration and drugs flowing across their borders with the U.S. He also said he was also looking at a 10% tariff on China.\n\nThe new date for the tariffs to take effect was Tuesday, Feb. 4. But Monday morning, Mexico and the United States reached a one-month agreement to stave off tariffs and a looming trade war. President Donald Trump announced later that day he was also pausing tariffs on Canada for at least 30 days after a phone call with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe tariffs on goods from China went into effect on Tuesday. China countered, saying it would levy its own tariffs on some U.S. goods: 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and 10% tariffs for crude oil, farm equipment and some cars.\n\nIn a published note last week, Morgan Stanley Economist Michael Gapen said tariffs could be used as a negotiating tool with Mexico as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is under review in the first half of the year.\n\n\"The President's suggestion that tariffs on Mexico/Canada could come by Feb. 1 remind us that vigilance is warranted as the U.S. policy path could evolve quickly,\" Gapen said.\n\nGapen also said effects of the tariffs will be felt through 2025 and 2026 with the \"tariff shock\" being over in the second half of 2026.\n\n'Another form of inflation, just spelled differently'\n\nThe tariffs could cost consumers an additional $2,500 to $7,600 a year per household, according to estimates, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation, in an interview in December.\n\nConsumers ultimately will pay for any tariffs that are put in place, said Darpan Seth, CEO of Nextuple, which helps build and support programs to help its clients get products for consumers in stores or online. The firm's client list includes major U.S. retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods and luxury brands such as Kate Spade and Coach.\n\n“For consumers, tariffs are like another form of inflation, just spelled differently,” Seth said. “They have the same effect of rising prices.”\n\nSome consumers are going to delay major purchases or make smaller repairs if prices go up for imported goods from certain countries, he said. For example, a consumer “may want to do a quick fix instead of trying to change the carburetor in your car,” Seth said.\n\nRetailers dealing with tariffs will have no choice in the short term but to increase prices, Seth said.\n\nUS retailers are worried about tariffs\n\nGold and other industry sources say even though the Trump administration threatened tariffs on imports during Trump's first administration – and followed through on some – things are different this time.\n\nThere’s a lot of concern among retailers represented by the National Retail Federation, (NRF) which includes both large and small businesses, Gold said.\n\n“There’s so much complexity in the supply chain and so many challenges in the supply chain as it is, to have something as big as these massive tariffs, is really causing disruption in itself and folks trying to figure out ‘What am I supposed to do?'\" Gold said.\n\nSince there were been several different scenarios of tariffs being discussed, retailers have been trying to come up with plans to address them all, he said.\n\nHow will tariffs impact consumers?\n\nAn NRF study looked at the estimated impacts of the tariffs on six consumer product categories: apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.\n\nRetailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components to offer customers a variety of products, Gold said. A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not by a foreign country or the exporter, he added.\n\nThe NRF said while some U.S. manufacturers could benefit from the tariffs, the gains to U.S. producers and the Treasury from tariff revenue do not outweigh overall losses to consumers.\n\nAccording to NRF, some examples of potential price increases with tariffs include:\n\n◾ A $40 toaster oven would cost consumers $48 to $52.\n\n◾ A $50 pair of athletic shoes would cost $59 to $64.\n\n◾ A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would end up costing $2,128 to $2,190.\n\nHigher prices and loss of spending power would hit low-income families especially hard, the retail federation said in its study, released on Nov. 4.\n\nGold said while the NRF looked at six specific categories, he also believes pricing for consumer electronics, pet products, children’s products and groceries, could be hit hard by the proposed tariffs.\n\nStill, there's some optimism. Financial advisors previously told USA TODAY Trump's tariffs during his first term didn't cause \"significantly high inflation.\" And Trump's administration remains steadfast on the benefits of tariffs.\n\n“President Trump has promised tariff policies that protect working Americans from the unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets,\" said Brian Hughes, Trump-Vance transition spokesman said earlier this month. \"As he did in his first term, he will implement economic and trade policies to make life affordable and more prosperous for our nation, while simultaneously leveling the playing field for American manufacturers.”\n\nHow are US retailers reacting and preparing for tariffs?\n\nSome retailers are looking at sourcing differently while others are putting in contingency plans, said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at the research and analytics firm GlobalData.\n\nThe retail federation’s retail members are trying to prepare for the best – and worst-case − scenarios, Gold said.\n\nLarger U.S. retailers have more ability to “mitigate and shift their sourcing,” Gold said. He added those shifts can't happen overnight. Smaller mom-and-pop stores and medium-sized retailers don’t have as much flexibility, he said. There's even worry the tariffs might cause some smaller retailers to go out of business, Gold said.\n\nThere have already been signs that consumers and retailers reacted to potential price increases and tariffs. According to the Wall Street Journal, some retailers during Black Friday ran advertisements for things like electronics, washing machines and refrigerators before prices increase due to tariffs. Seth said sales figures from Black Friday and Cyber Monday have shown that purchases in those categories went up.\n\nPrice increases are coming for consumers\n\nLarger retailers also warned consumers will pay higher prices with tariffs, Gold said. Price increases for consumers will be dependent on how quickly tariffs go into effect.\n\nA spokesperson for Walmart declined to comment, but in an interview with CNBC in early November before the election, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the retailer may have to raise prices on some items if Trump’s proposed tariffs take effect.\n\n“Our model is everyday low prices,\" he said in the interview. \"But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.”\n\nDollar Tree executives, in a December earnings call, said the price of the store’s products may increase again because of tariffs. The discount retailer also said, as previously reported in USA TODAY, that proposed tariffs could also change what products consumers could find at Dollar Tree.\n\nThe media relations department for Gap, which also includes Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSonthalia said retailers at the Washington meeting she attended said they could absorb costs by implementing some cost-efficiency and pricing strategies if tariffs were up to 10%. Otherwise, costs would be passed to consumers, she said.\n\nGold said even if the tariffs don't go into effect, \"just the threat alone is causing a little bit of chaos within the supply chain.\" There was also the threat of the now averted port strike earlier in January, he said.\n\nSaunders said some retailers think the tariffs might be just a Trump negotiating tool.\n\nSonthalia, whose clients include Fortune 15 companies and small and independent retailers across all sectors, including food, pharmacy, electronics and apparel, believes \"the tariffs are definitely coming.\"\n\n“It’s a question of to what degree,” she said.\n\nConsumers don't want to pay prices for goods made in the USA\n\nConsumers are price-conscious and don't want to pay what it would cost to manufacture many of the items they want in the U.S., said Lauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nManufacturing for many goods in the United States is expensive because costs are high for labor, production and building facilities, said Beitelspacher, who studies the retail industry. Moving manufacturing to the U.S. would cause prices to \"skyrocket,\" she said.\n\n\"Consumers have a reference price of what they’re willing to pay for something and if it goes over that reference price, then they really question if they need it, especially if it’s something that’s a nonessential good,” Beitelspacher said.\n\nThe U.S. also does not have some of the raw materials for some products like silks, which may be sourced overseas, so those import costs would be expensive, she said.\n\nBeitelspacher said she thinks there is a strong possibility large U.S. retailers – as well as major lobbying groups for industries such as food, apparel, retail and electronics – will push back on the Trump administration's plans.\n\nCompanies can't make changes to manufacturing quickly\n\nBesides, many retailers make business decisions six to 12 months in advance, Gold said. They couldn't afford to wait until Trump took office to make a choice.\n\nStill, retailers and suppliers learned through Trump's previous administration they needed to be more nimble in their supply chains, said Gold. Relying solely on China wasn't an option, he said. Tariffs could be \"a useful part of the toolbox when talking about trade policy,\" Gold said. But it can't be the only tool, he added.\n\nOverall, the situation is complicated, Gold said.\n\nPlus, “It’s not easy to move your supply chain. It takes months, if not years to be able to do that,” Gold said.\n\nMajor U.S. apparel and footwear retailers that Beitelspacher spoke to said they are looking into other manufacturing facilities in countries like Indonesia that may not be hit with the tariffs for exports.\n\nMoves to other countries could affect product quality and more\n\nThe quality of consumer goods could also be impacted as businesses look to other countries – which might have different labor, safety and quality standards – for their manufacturing needs, Beitelspacher said.\n\nThat said, the new business due to Trump's tariffs could be an opportunity for economic growth for some developing nations, said Beitelspacher.\n\nBut, there is also a possibility that some overbooked manufacturing facilities in some countries may outsource some excess production – without the knowledge of the retailer – to what Beitelspacher called \"unauthorized facilities.\" Those facilities may have no oversight or labor policies, which might allow for longer working hours, fewer environmental protections, lower wages and less safe working conditions for employees, she said.\n\nThen, Beitelspacher said, “we’re going to have not only an environmental issue but then potentially a major human rights issue as well.”\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Those features have had an \"devastating effect\" on the mental health of children, Renner said.\n\nHere's what happens next: Does the social media bill affect Instagram and TikTok?\n\nTech trade group files lawsuit against measure\n\nRenner predicted an imminent legal challenge from NetChoice, a tech industry trade group that has filed lawsuits in other states against similar measures and has opposed Florida's.\n\nIn a statement shared shortly after the signing, the group called the restrictions unconstitutional.\n\n“An unconstitutional law will protect exactly zero Floridians,\" said Carl Szabo, NetChoice's vice president and general counsel. \"HB 3 is also bad policy because of the data collection on Floridians by online services it will in effect require. This will put their private data at risk of breach.\n\n“HB 3 forces Floridians to hand over sensitive personal information to websites or lose their access to critical information channels,\" he continued. \"This infringes on Floridians’ First Amendment rights to share and access speech online.”\n\nFlorida joins eight states with age-verification laws\n\nFlorida has joined seven other states in blocking millions of people from accessing Pornhub’s adult video site unless they can prove they are at least 18 years old.\n\nLast June, Texas passed HB 1181 requiring companies that feature “sexual material harmful to minors” to verify their age with proof of government-issued identification or another system that uses public and private data.\n\nLouisiana was the first to pass an age-verification requirement law but other states include Arkansas, Utah, Montana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n\"So far, six other states have copied this (Louisiana) bill but minor changes have been made to the text, which can have big implications for systems designed to achieve compliance,\" reads a post from the Age Verification Providers Association, the nonprofit global trade body representing 26 organizations who provide \"age assurance solutions.\"\n\nAdvocates say laws restrict sites for adults, too\n\nWith more states passing similar legislation, attorneys and advocates for porn sites have argued that the laws also prohibit adult access. Pornhub has completely disabled website access in Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina because of age-verification requirement laws. The company said it had no choice in order to reduce the risk of hefty fines and penalties.\n\nLast year the Free Speech Coalition, a national advocacy organization for the First Amendment rights of adult businesses, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Utah over what it called an “anti-porn ban.”\n\n“We are fighting not only for the rights of our members and the larger adult entertainment community, but for the right of all Americans to access constitutionally protected expression in the privacy of their own home,\" Executive Director Alison Boden said.\n\nIn February, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pornhub’s parent company, Aylo, in an effort to force them to comply with HB 1181. The Republican threatened Aylo with millions of dollars in civil penalties\n\n“Texas has a right to protect its children from the detrimental effects of pornographic content,” Paxton said when announcing the lawsuit. “I look forward to holding any company accountable that violates our age verification laws intended to prevent minors from being exposed to harmful, obscene material on the internet.”\n\nContributing: Jonathan Limehouse and Kayla Jimenez", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/tech/att-3g-network-shutdown/index.html", "title": "AT&T is shutting down its 3G network. Here's how it could impact ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nTwenty years after 3G was first introduced in the United States, paving the way for a new generation of mobile apps, the network is officially being phased out.\n\nAT&T is set to pull the plug on its 3G network Tuesday, with other major US carriers expected to follow suit later this year. The move impacts everything from older phones to home alarm systems and roadside assistance systems.\n\nTo move its mobile customers over to 4G without service interruptions, AT&T (T), which owns CNN’s parent company, has been providing free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device. It has also been attempting to alert customers to the network changes through various methods.\n\n“For nearly two years, we’ve proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail, bill messaging, emails and text messages to help customers transition to next generation networks before 3G services end on February 22,” AT&T told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nAT&T is shutting down its 3G networks as part of a greater effort to re-use the spectrum for 4G and 5G — newer standards that are more efficient than 3G. T-Mobile (TMUS) will do the same in the third quarter and Verizon (VZ) will do so by the end of the year.\n\nHere’s what you should know about the 3G shutdown.\n\nWhat products will be impacted?\n\nThe shutdown will impact people still using 3G Kindles, 3G flip phones, the iPhone 5 and older models as well as various Android phones. It will also affect home alarm systems and medical devices such as fall detectors. Some in-car crash notification and roadside assistance systems like OnStar will need to be updated or replaced, too.\n\nIf you’re not sure which network your phone is on, open Settings, tap Network and Internet, and then select Mobile Network on Android devices. On iOS, choose Settings, Cellular and then pick Cellular Data Options. AT&T also has a dedicated webpage to determine if your device will be impacted by the shut down.\n\nIt can be harder to tell with other everyday products. If you’re not sure whether the device relies on 3G, you can call the manufacturer or car dealer.\n\nWhat can I do about it?\n\nFor those who don’t want to get rid of their 3G mobile devices, there are some workarounds. In theory, it will be possible to access a web browser via Wi-Fi or make calls over wireless on a 3G phone if the user has an app enabling voice-over-internet protocol, such as Facebook Messenger. Similarly, people with a 3G e-reader will still be able to download new books on the device via Wi-Fi.\n\nOther 3G products may be more complicated. My Alarm Center, a home security systems business, has warned customers that certain alarm systems will need to be replaced by a technician to avoid potential disruptions. “Even if your alarm appears to function, it will no longer communicate with our central service station to notify us that emergency services are needed,” the company states on its website.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM), which owns OnStar, started pushing over-the-air updates in October to vehicles released as far back as 2015, including models from Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, which may be impacted by the transition. As a general rule, most cars built in the last five years with connectivity are using 4G modems. If the car does run on 3G, the manufacturer may offer an upgrade program or the wireless carrier can provide an adapter with a modem that can be plugged into a vehicle.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe 3G network launched in 2002 and became the driving force behind the early App Store boom around the end of that decade. The wireless companies later moved on to 4G and more recently 5G networks.\n\nLast month, AT&T and Verizon turned on C-band 5G networks, an important set of higher radio frequencies that will supercharge the internet. The change will allow users to, for example, stream a Netflix movie in 4K resolution or download a movie in seconds. (Verizon said its C-band speeds reach nearly 1 gigabyte per second, about 10 times as fast as 4G LTE.)\n\nOnly a small portion of wireless customers are still using 3G networks. Verizon said in a blog post that 99% of its customers have already upgraded to 4G LTE or 5G, and AT&T said less than 1% of its mobile data traffic runs on 3G networks. T-Mobile did not respond to a request for comment about its 3G user base.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/10/supreme-court-tiktok-oral-arguments-live-updates/77543920007/", "title": "TikTok ban before the Supreme Court: Recap", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday over whether TikTok can be banned in the U.S. later this month in a case pitting two major issues − freedom of speech and national security − against each other.\n\nAt the end of two and a half hours of questions, the justices appeared ready to uphold a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell off its U.S. business or face a ban.\n\nSome of the 170 million Americans who use TikTok say the court has never confronted a free speech case that matters to so many people.\n\nThe Biden administration defended the law, saying the wildly popular short-form video app is a grave threat because China can use it to gather data on Americans or manipulate content to shape U.S. opinion.\n\nLawyers for TikTok and for a group of TikTok creators argued Friday the law deprives users of their preferred digital publisher, infringing on the right to free expression. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that as long as TikTok is owned by China-based ByteDance, U.S. national security is at risk.\n\nUnless the high court intervenes, Google, Apple and internet providers won't be allowed to make TikTok available after Jan. 19.\n\nFollow along for live coverage and updates.\n\nGroup led by billionaire Frank McCourt offers to buy TikTok\n\nProject Liberty, an advocacy group led by billionaire Frank McCourt, said Thursday that it had made a bid to ByteDance to purchase TikTok's U.S. assets.\n\nThe group's president, Tomicah Tillemann, said in a statement that the amount of the offer would be kept private \"until ByteDance is in a position to review our proposal.\" But McCourt has previously said he has received verbal commitments totaling up to $20 billion.\n\nMcCourt announced the plan to buy TikTok in December and earlier this week, \"Shark Tank\" host and investor Kevin O'Leary joined in.\n\nIf Project Liberty were to acquire TikTok, it would only be the U.S. portion of the platform and would not include TikTok's lucrative algorithm, which China sees as its intellectual property.\n\n−Greta Cross\n\nSome TikTok rivals see small Wall Street gains\n\nFacebook and Instagram parent company Meta and Snapchat owner Snap Inc. ended Friday up 0.8% and 3.6%, respectively, as the benchmark S&P 500 sank 1.5%. Both companies offer their own short-form video platforms that compete with TikTok.\n\nAlphabet, the company behind Google – which offers its own short-form videos through YouTube shorts – ended the day down 1.1%.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nTikTok lawyer: Justices understand the stakes\n\nTikTok Attorney Noel Francisco spoke with reporters at the National Press Club.\n\n“We thought that the argument went very well, that justices are extremely engaged,\" he said. \"They fully understand the importance of this case, not only for the American citizens of this country, but for First Amendment law – generally the rights of everybody.”\n\n“We thought that they vigorously questioned both sides. They put us through our paces,\" said Francisco, who served as U.S. solicitor general during Donald Trump's first term. \"But what really came through is that they understand the importance of this case. We're very hopeful of a favorable decision.”\n\nTikTok and a group of TikTok creators want the high court to either overturn the law requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the app's U.S. business, or to postpone the Jan. 19 deadline so the incoming Trump administration can find a compromise that won't force the app to shut down.\n\n−Rebecca Morin\n\nTikTok’s impact on the U.S. economy\n\nLast year, TikTok issued an economic impact report arguing that it contributed $24.2 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and supported 224,000 jobs in 2023.\n\n“TikTok provides an opportunity for (small and midsized businesses) to grow by allowing them to market themselves both organically and/or through investing in paid advertising and creator marketing,” the report reads.\n\nReuters in November reported that TikTok's parent company ByteDance valued itself at about $300 billion, but it’s not clear how much the U.S. portion of TikTok's business is worth on its own.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nWhen did Trump change his mind on TikTok?\n\nAfter pushing for a TikTok ban during his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump has since argued that he can work to save the app.\n\nTrump’s change of heart may have stemmed from the app’s use in connecting him to young voters – his account has 14.8 million followers as of Friday. Those with ties the company may have also influenced Trump’s change of heart, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\nLess than two weeks after reportedly meeting with billionaire Jeff Yass, a major conservative donor with financial ties to ByteDance, in March 2024, Trump told CNBC that there are “a lot of good users, a lot of good” on TikTok. Yass' trading firm, Susquehanna International Group, purchased a large stake in ByteDance in 2012.\n\nIn 2020, Trump wrote that Chinese ownership gave Beijing access to \"Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\"\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat makes TikTok’s algorithm so effective?\n\nTikTok has been able to capture roughly 170 million Americans’ attention thanks to its algorithm-fueled “For You\" page.\n\nA 2020 blog post from TikTok said it focuses on various user interactions to decode users’ interests and tailor the app’s feed. This includes likes, shares, follows, and time spent watching; video information such as hashtags; and device settings like language preferences and location.\n\nThe app’s short video format gives it plenty of data to work with. While one YouTube video could take 10 minutes to watch, a TikTok user could scroll through dozens of videos in that same time frame, offering the app's algorithm plenty of input.\n\n“Every new interaction helps the system learn about your interests and suggest content – so the best way to curate your For You feed is to simply use and enjoy the app,” TikTok’s blog post reads.\n\nTikTok will also occasionally show users content outside of their interests, an “important and intentional component” to the app’s recommendations approach, according to the company.\n\nTikTok’s approach has received criticism. One December 2022 report from the watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate accused the app of pushing harmful content promoting eating disorders and self-harm into young users’ feeds.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nArguments conclude in Supreme Court TikTok ban appeal\n\nEach side has made its case to the nine justices and the high court has adjounred. Lawyers for TikTok will speak to reporters at 3 p.m. Eastern at the National Press Club.\n\nAlito questions temporarily blocking the TikTok ban\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked whether the court could temporarily block the law, which is scheduled to ban TikTok on Jan. 19.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the court shouldn’t do that unless TikTok was likely to win based on its First Amendment claim of a right to distribute its content. She said it wasn’t just an executive action, but done in concert with bipartisan majorities in Congress.\n\n“I think this court doesn’t have any basis to enter a temporary injunction unless it thinks petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of the First Amendment claim,” Prelogar said. “To be honest, I think there is no argument to be made that you should find that likely success.”\n\nAlito also asked whether the court could administratively halt the law temporarily. Prelogar said she would defer to the justices about whether they have enough time to decide the case, but that both sides were ready to argue the case Friday.\n\n“I think it is in the interest of Congress’ work and our national security to resolve the case and allow the statute to take effect,” Prelogar said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nSotomayor: TikTok ban would still be valid even if Trump doesn't enforce it\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that President-elect Donald Trump, during his first term, tried to require divestiture – even though he now opposes a ban.\n\nShe said she’s concerned that a president-elect might choose not to enforce a law, and a company would ignore enforcement. There would still be a violation, she emphasized.\n\n“Whatever the new president does,” Sotomayor said, “doesn’t change that reality for those companies.”\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nKavanaugh: Can Trump choose not to enforce the ban?\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh probed whether President-elect Donald Trump – who opposes a ban – can choose not to enforce it after he takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said presidents, in general, have enforcement discretion.\n\nBut Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app may not feel that’s enough protection from the law’s stiff penalties, Kavanaugh said.\n\nPrelogar said that’s not necessarily the case.\n\nBut she said Trump might want to review all the national security information that has been gathered since he was last in office before deciding whether to enforce the ban.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nPrelogar: ByteDance information sharing ‘eye-opening’\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the Biden administration discussed potential limits on ByteDance’s data sharing for years before Congress passed the law to ban it, but found no way to create a true firewall between U.S.-based TikTok and its Chinese-controlled parent.\n\n“That didn’t come across enough in the briefs,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\n\nPrelogar said there are enormous amounts of data flowing between TikTok and ByteDance to keep the algorithm updated about what are the best videos to promote. Under a confidential security agreement that ByteDance proposed, Prelogar said, a wealth of information about Americans goes back to China.\n\n“It’s eye-opening,” Prelogar said. “It creates this gaping vulnerability in the system because once that data is in China, the PRC (People’s Republic of China) can demand that ByteDance turn that data over and keep that assistance secret.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJustice Department says First Amendment not an issue\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch both pressed the Justice Department’s attorney on why the government’s concern about China’s content manipulation doesn’t make the law “content based” – which would implicate the 1st Amendment.\n\n“It’s kind of hard to avoid the word `content,’” Gorsuch said.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said she’s not disputing that the law is related to content. But the 1st Amendment would only come into play if Congress was trying to discriminate against particular subject matters or viewpoints, she said.\n\n“Here, Congress just wants to cut the PRC out of the equation altogether and all the same speech could continue to happen on the platform,” Prelogar said.\n\nPrelogar also emphasized that the law had broad bipartisan support, which is not always the case.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nRoberts asks if China is fueling American arguments through TikTok\n\nChief Justice John Roberts asked whether the government was saying “ByteDance through TikTok is trying to get Americans to argue with each other?”\n\n“If they do, I’d say they’re winning,” Roberts said to laughter in the court.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said it very well might be true.\n\n“China is a foreign adversary nation that looks for every opportunity it has to weaken the United States and to try to threaten our national security,” Prelogar said. “If it has control over this key communications channel, it’s hard to predict … exactly how it’s going to use that as a tool to harm our interest.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nGovernment says China disclosure not good enough\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch pushed the government on why requiring TikTok to disclose that China could manipulate content wouldn’t adequately address its concerns.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said a “generic, generalized disclosure” wouldn’t reasonably put users on notice about when the manipulation is happening.\n\nDoes that mean the average American won’t be able to figure out that cat videos can be manipulated by China, Gorsuch asked.\n\nPrelogar responded by comparing the situation to a sign in a store telling customers that one of the million items in that store causes cancer.\n\n“That is not going to put you on notice about what product is actually jeopardizing your health,” she said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nAlito asks if TikTok’s ‘magical algorithm’ is like a favorite shirt\n\nJustice Samuel Alito asked whether another company could take TikTok’s place if the company went dark, “to take advantage of the very lucrative market.”\n\n“I’m just wondering whether this is like somebody’s attachment to an old article of clothing,” Alito said. “Is there some reason to think only ByteDance has devised this magical algorithm?”\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for TikTok creators, said they have tried to post on other sites and “fallen dramatically short.”\n\n“I think empirically other companies have been trying for a few years to catch up with TikTok and replicate it and have been very unsuccessful,” Fisher said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJustice Department calls TikTok a `grave threat’\n\nLawyers for TikTok and the TikTok creators have completed their arguments. Now it's the Justice Department's turn.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar began her argument by saying TikTok poses a “grave threat” to national security from the People’s Republic of China.\n\n“No one disputes that the PRC seeks to undermine U.S. interest by amassing vast quantities of sensitive data about Americans and by engaging in covert influence operations,” she said.\n\nAcknowledging that millions of Americans enjoy expressing themselves on the platform, Prelogar said the law has a “laser like focus” on that threat by requiring TikTok cut ties with China.\n\n“The First Amendment does not bar Congress from taking that critical and targeted step to protect our nation’s security,” she said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok creators could win case for their content: lawyer\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett asked if there was any way for the TikTok creators to win the case – because of their concerns about having a place to post their content – even if the company were to lose.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for creators, said it’s possible because the core speech on the platform is the millions of videos posted daily. He said the court has recognized that American listeners have a right to receive information from specific places.\n\n“I think it’s possible,” Jeffrey Fisher said to laughter in the courtroom. “I don’t think we should.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nGorsuch raises concern about the government’s use of classified information\n\nIn one of the few concerns justices have expressed so far about the government’s position, Justice Neil Gorsuch said he worries about the Justice Department using classified information to help make their case about a national security threat.\n\nBecause the information is classified, TikTok isn’t able to look at it to counter it.\n\nThat issue came up when the appeals court considered the case. But when siding with the government, that court said they did not rely on the classified information.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nAttorney not sure Trump can extend TikTok deadline after taking office\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch asked if the incoming administration can extend the Jan. 19th deadline once Donald Trump takes office, even if the Supreme Court sides against TikTok.\n\n“Is that possible as you read the law?” Gorsuch asked Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for TikTok content providers.\n\nFisher said he wasn’t sure and said Gorsuch should ask the Justice Department’s attorney, who is up next.\n\nGorsuch said he plans to do that.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nEven if TikTok closes down, it’s keeping user data: lawyer\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether lawmakers could separate provisions of the legislation between security concerns over data collection and forcing TikTok to discuss its algorithm.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer for the creators, criticized the law if the goal was to prevent data sharing.\n\nIf the company closes down, “TikTok gets to keep all data,” Fisher said. “It’s a very weird law if you’re just looking at it through a data-security lens. Maybe Congress could do better.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhat would a TikTok ban mean for users?\n\nA TikTok ban wouldn’t mean the app disappears from current users’ phones on Jan. 19.\n\nNew users in the U.S. would likely no longer be able to download TikTok from app stores, and it would become inaccessible through internet browsers. Current users would no longer be able to download software and security updates, and the app could become unusable over time.\n\nBut there may be ways for users to work around the ban. Content creators on the app have spread videos about using a virtual private network, or VPN, as a way to hide their location to access TikTok.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nThomas questions how law hurts TikTok users\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas asked how the law hurt the free speech of TikTok’s users.\n\n“It doesn’t say anything about creators or people who use the site,” Thomas said. “It’s only concerned about the ownership and the concerns that data will be manipulated or there will be other national security problems with someone who is not a citizen of this country.\"\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a lawyer representing TikTok creators, said the law regulates their text, images, real time communications and videos. He argued that Congress shouldn’t be able to dictate the ownership of platforms, such as forcing X, formerly known as Twitter, to close if it changed owners\n\n“American creators have the right to work with the publishers of their choice,” Fisher said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nListen in: Live Supreme Court arguments on the TikTok ban case\n\nAudio of today’s arguments can be accessed through the Supreme Court’s website.\n\nThe arguments are scheduled for two hours but are expected to go longer.\n\nLive Oral Argument Audio\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok content creators’ lawyer: `Mere ideas do not constitute a national security threat’\n\nThe lawyer representing content creators on TikTok opened his arguments by telling the justices the creators have the right to use the publisher of their choice.\n\nAmericans have long enjoyed the right to work with foreign publishers, Jeffrey Fisher said, calling TikTok the most vibrant speech forum in the U.S.\n\nThe government’s concern that China can covertly manipulate content on that forum is not enough to overcome the 1st Amendment issues, he said.\n\n“Mere ideas do not constitute a national security threat,” Fisher said, and restricting speech because it might sow doubt about U.S. leaders or undermine democracy “are the kinds of things our enemies do.”\n\n“It is not what we do in this country,” he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nKavanaugh: Potential TikTok data sharing ‘huge concern’\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said Congress and the president were concerned China is harvesting information about Americans over time to develop spies and blackmail people years from now.\n\n“Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?” Kavanaugh asked.\n\nNoel Francisco, a Tiktok lawyer, said the platform's data is stored on Oracle servers in Virginia. He said the law should be overturned or at least blocked temporarily because Congress didn’t consider alternatives such as \"massive penalties\" like fining or jailing TikTok workers for data disclosures.\n\n“I’m not disputing the risks,” replied Francisco. “I certainly acknowledge the risk but I think there are lots of reasons why that risk still can’t justify the law.”\n\nKavanaugh said concerns remain.\n\n“That seems like a huge concern for the future of the country,” Kavanaugh said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTikTok on Jan 19: `Essentially the platform shuts down’\n\nAsked by Justice Brett Kavanaugh what will happen on Jan. 19 if the law is not blocked, TikTok’s lawyer said the platform will shut down.\n\n“At least as I understand it, we go dark,” Noel Francisco said. “Essentially the platform shuts down.”\n\nAfter President-elect Trump takes office on Jan. 20, he said, “we might be in a different world.”\n\nTrump has said he thinks he can find another way to address the national security concerns without infringing on 1st Amendment rights.\n\nThat’s why, Francisco said, the Supreme Court should at least put the law on hold to “buy everyone some breathing space.”\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nRoberts asks for a previous decision that would back up TikTok’s argument\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pushed back on TikTok’s argument that the government’s interference with the company’s ownership infringes on the expression of other people.\n\nHe asked TikTok’s lawyer to point to a previous case where regulating a corporate structure has been treated as a violation of the 1st Amendment.\n\nFrancisco said he didn’t have an example at his fingertips. But he said it’s still clear that government telling a company “you have to stop talking unless somebody ese does something” directly affects the company’s speech.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nKagan: Doesn’t the law target a foreign company?\n\nJustice Elana Kagan pushed TikTok on why the main effects of the law are on TikTok, rather than the parent company ByteDance, which is not protected by the 1st Amendment.\n\nTikTok can still go out and find the best available algorithm if it’s divested from ByteDance, she said.\n\nTikTok’s lawyer said the effects on the American company are not incidental. The company won’t be able to operate in 10 days unless it’s sold.\n\nFrancisco also said ByteDance has 1st Amendment rights when it is operating in the United States, as do TikTok and its users.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nJustice Barrett: Congress concerned about China manipulating TikTok content\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett said TikTok’s examples of free speech include the independence to be supportive of China. She said the concern is with covert manipulation of those messages.\n\n“A lot of your examples talk about … the right of an American citizen to repeat what a foreign entity says, or say, ‘I’m hitching my wagon to China. I want to say everything China does,’” Barrett said. “Here the concern is about the covert content manipulation of the algorithm. That is something that ByteDance wants to speak, right?”\n\nNoel Francisco, a TikTok lawyer, said it was ultimately TikTok's choice whether to put content on the platform and he denied that TikTok wants to parrot Chinese propaganda.\n\n“We absolutely resist any kind of content manipulation by China at all,” Francisco said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nDoes China control TikTok? `Somebody has to be right.’\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch said the government and TikTok dispute how much control China has over the company and asked what the record shows.\n\n“Somebody has to be right,” he said.\n\nFrancisco said TikTok can choose not to use ByteDance’s algorithm, though that would be a bad business decision.\n\nBut if TikTok is being pressured by China to do something nefarious, the company can shut down. That underscores why TikTok, an American company, has First Amendment rights, Francisco said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok lawyer says nation’s history of preventing foreign control of media not relevant\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether the justices should consider the long history of the government preventing foreign control of media, one of the considerations cited by an appeals court judge who earlier sided with the government.\n\nFrancisco said that’s not important in this case because previous restrictions were tied to the limited number of broadcasting licenses available. There’s no scarcity on the internet, he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nThomas: What is TikTok’s speech?\n\nThe case turns at least in part on whether TikTok has a First Amendment right to keep operating, so Justice Clarence Thomas asked “exactly what is TikTok’s speech here?”\n\nThomas asked why a restriction on ByteDance, a Chinese company, represents a limit on TikTok.\n\nNoel Francisco, a former solicitor general representing TikTok, said it is the algorithm that decides what is the best mix of content for its users. Losing the ByteDance algorithm thorugh a sale of TikTok, would limit the app's ability to serve its users.\n\n“That’s a direct burden on TikTok’s speech,” Francisco said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nYoung people ponder a post-TikTok world\n\nNora Miller, 20, walked to the Supreme Court with a gaggle of Drake University students before the sun came up this morning for a shot at witnessing history. The case, Miller said, has been a constant topic of conversation among people her age.\n\nBut her classmate, Olivia Swaney, said the prospect of TikTok vanishing on Jan. 19 still doesn’t feel real.\n\n“This will be the first time we really see a whole lot of, like, regulation on social media,” Swaney said. “It feels unreal but real at the same time that we're having a Supreme Court case over an app that we all like to watch cat videos on.”\n\nIf the Court upholds the ban, Miller and Swaney say they’ll likely increase their use of Instagram because the algorithms of the photo app are the most similar. Others, including 21-year-old Eli Benson, say they might take a TikTok ban as a cue to decrease their social media consumption.\n\n“Maybe this is my sign to be done,” Benson said. “I would be ready for a little bit less social media.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump pledges to ‘save TikTok’ after first trying to ban it\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump claims he can “save” TikTok and asked the Supreme Court to pause a law that could ban the social media platform in the U.S. − a big change from his first term, when he wanted it shut down.\n\nCongress agreed last year to ban TikTok by Jan. 19 unless it was divested from ByteDance, its China-based parent company, because of national security concerns about the Chinese gathering data on American users.\n\nThat position echoed Trump’s position in 2020, when he signed an executive order as president ordering ByteDance to sell or spin off its U.S. assets within 90 days. The order was challenged in court and never came to fruition.\n\nSince then, Trump has accumulated 14.7 million followers on TikTok and founded his own social media platform, Truth Social. During 2024, he campaigned that he could “save TikTok.”\n\nTrump told the Supreme Court taht voters have given him a mandate to protect their free-speech rights.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nArguments begin in pivotal free speech case\n\nThe lawyer representing TikTok opened his argument by telling the justices that one of American’s most popular speech platforms will shut down in nine days unless they intervene.\n\nBanning TikTok, Noel Franciso said, would violate the free speech rights of the company and its users.\n\nThe law Congress passed is singling the platform out for “uniquely harsh treatment” because of the government’s fear about what might happen in the future.\n\nThere are better ways of addressing that concern, he said.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nCollege students question national security concerns central to case\n\nMonica Vasquez, 21, huddled with friends and fellow students from a University of California semester program in Washington, D.C., to stay warm as she waited to enter the Supreme Court.\n\nVasquez, a political science student, said she was intrigued by the case’s central questions about whether a ban on the video platform would inhibit the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\n\nLike many people her age, Vasquez said she predominantly gets her news from the social media platform and doesn’t see the national security concerns others have warned about.\n\n“People are like, ‘Oh, but they're stealing our data. I was like, 'Everyone's stealing my data,'” she said. “You're banning a whole app because of the fact that it's not run by America, it's a Chinese company. I think that's kind of insane.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nWill classified information come into play?\n\nNot all the information the government has to persuade the court that TikTok poses a “grave” national security risk can be presented in public. Classified information is also part of the record.\n\nThe appeals court judges who sided with the government said they did not rely on the classified information in upholding the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nLawyers for TikTok told the Supreme Court they shouldn’t even consider the classified materials since they weren’t part of the decision they’re reviewing.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok creators and small business owners fear death of app\n\nCallie Goodwin flew in from South Carolina with her friend and fellow TikTok content creator Sarah Baus to watch the oral arguments on Friday. Goodwin, 30, and Baus, 27, both said they rely on TikTok for their livelihoods.\n\nGoodwin, who owns a small greeting card and personalized gift store called Sparks Of Joy Co, said as much as 98% of her sales come from people who find her business on TikTok. Several months ago, during the height of the holiday gift shopping season, she said she sold over $30,000 worth of products on the app in just nine days.\n\n“If we were to lose TikTok, I really fear for the survival of my business,” Goodwin told USA TODAY while waiting in line Friday morning. She argues that TikTok’s unique algorithm allows small businesses like hers to flourish in a way other platforms, like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, don’t.\n\n“We've got 115,000 followers over on TikTok. We've got, like, less than 3,000 (followers) combined between Instagram and Facebook,” she said. “To have that entire community, that customer base, and that ability to reach our target audience wiped out would be devastating for my business.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nTikTok is a growing source of news for Americans\n\nThe debate over TikTok comes as the platform has grown in popularity as a source of information.\n\nAbout four in ten young adults in the U.S. regularly get news from the app, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nNo social media platform the center has studied has seen faster growth in the share of Americans who regularly turn to it for news.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nCreators want Trump to fulfill promise to 'save TikTok'\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump, in a legal filing last month, urged the Supreme Court to pause the impending ban. He said that once he takes office on Jan. 20, he can find a way to address the national security concerns about TikTok without compromising free speech.\n\nIf the court does not do that, Trump could direct his attorney general not to enforce the ban. The problem with that is whether Apple, Google and any other conduits for the app will feel that’s enough protection from the law’s stiff penalties.\n\n−Maureen Groppe\n\nTikTok or nothing, says one creator, snubbing Reels and YouTube\n\nAround 70 people waited outside the Supreme Court on Friday morning in 20 degree weather to hear oral arguments. Almost all were bundled up in with scarfs, hats and hoods over their heads — some wrapped themeselves in blankets and one man wore ski goggles.\n\nAshley Wilson, 30, arrived at the Court last night around 7:30 p.m. to get a spot in line. Aside from two brief bathroom breaks at her apartment in DC's nearby Chinatown, she’s been here for more than 12 hours.\n\nA lawyer by day, Wilson runs a TikTok channel where she streams court cases and discusses criminal law. Amid the Arctic chill, she was live-streaming her experience in line and explaining the contours of the case for followers.\n\n“I’m honestly going in with an open mind,” she said. “I’m ready to hear evidence, if there is evidence of threats. I'm not sure that we've covered evidence of that so so far about national security concerns, but I'm very open minded to hearing it.”\n\nIf the court upholds the pending TikTok ban, Wilson said she’ll likely find another hobby rather than migrating her content to another platform − like Meta’s Instagram Reels or YouTube.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen will the Supreme Court make a decision on TikTok?\n\nThe court is hearing the case on an extremely expedited basis because of the impending Jan. 19 deadline for TikTok to divest from its parent company, ByteDance.\n\nThe court could decide quickly whether to at least pause the deadline while the justices decide if they will uphold the law.\n\nAlthough that wouldn't be a final decision, it would give a strong indication of which way the court is likely to rule.\n\nWho is arguing before the Supreme Court?\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, is taking on one last big case before the change in administrations.\n\nPrelogar will face off against Noel Francisco, who was President-elect Donald Trump's solicitor general in Trump's first administration and is representing TikTok.\n\nJeffrey Fisher, a partner at O’Melveny & Myers who has argued four dozen cases at the court, is representing TikTok creators.\n\nWhat is the legal issue being decided?\n\nThe justices are debating whether requiring the divesture of TikTok from ByteDance infringes on Americans' 1st Amendment rights of free speech.\n\nIf it does, the government has to convince the court that they have a good reason for doing so and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that goal.\n\nHow high a bar this will be for the government to clear depends on how much − if at all − the justices think the law is regulating speech.\n\nHow did the lower court rule?\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously upheld the law.\n\nJudge Douglas Ginsburg wrote that the law was was “carefully crafted” and is part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by China.\n\nTwo of three judges were appointed by Republican presidents −Trump and Ronald Reagan. The third was appointed by a Democrat, Barack Obama.\n\nWhat is the law TikTok is challenging?\n\nCongress last year passed the law being challenged with broad bipartisan support and President Joe Biden signed it into law.\n\nTikTok had proposed ways of addressing the government’s concern without a sale.\n\nBut the Biden administration concluded that some data of U.S. users would still flow to China and ByteDance would still be able to exert control over TikTok’s operations in the U.S. The administration also didn’t trust that ByteDance would comply in good faith and didn’t think the U.S. could adequately monitor compliance.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html", "title": "BeReal: This social app bans edited photos to encourage users to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nScoot over, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThere’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.\n\nThe app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.\n\nWe joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.\n\nSo, what’s BeReal?\n\nBeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.\n\nAs its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.\n\nIt has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.\n\nThe result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.\n\nThe BeReal app launched in late 2020 and is rapidly growing in popularity among young people. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.” That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.\n\nThere’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.\n\n“Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”\n\nThat means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you. (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)\n\nThe result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.\n\nWith only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.\n\nGeorgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.\n\n“What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.\n\nTelerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.\n\n“I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”\n\nBen Telerski and Alexandra Henn in an image from his BeReal app. The app takes a dual photo showing the user's selfie and what's in front of them. Courtesy Ben Telerski\n\nWhat happens if you don’t post within the two minutes?\n\nWhen you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.\n\nThe app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.\n\nBeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.\n\nWhy are people using it?\n\nBeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.\n\nTelerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.\n\n“I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.\n\nBeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram. BeReal\n\nMorgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.\n\n“It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”\n\nIn a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.\n\n“BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,” the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”\n\nAre BeReal posts really so authentic?\n\nThe app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.\n\nBut some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\n\n“There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\n\n“It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”\n\nThe young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.\n\nNott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.\n\nTelerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\n\n“For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.\n\n“Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/tech/cnn-tech-picks-2022/index.html", "title": "The tech we couldn't live without in 2022 | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nBone conduction headphones, TV streaming devices and Bluetooth speakers are among the tech gadgets topping holiday wish lists this year.

Service was swiftly restored to the popular short-form video app Sunday, although Apple and Google haven't returned it to their app stores for downloading.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Sunday that he would issue the order on his first day as a second-term president \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\n\"The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\" Trump promised.\n\nWhether Trump's executive order can truly halt the law temporarily isn't clear. The law works by imposing a $5,000 fine on companies for each user who accesses TikTok through their services. That includes companies like Apple and Google that provide platforms to download and update apps and companies like Oracle that provide internet hosting services.\n\nFederal employees required to return to work in-person\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing department heads to require federal employees to \"return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis\" immediately, with exemptions allowed.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 federal workers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure they comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).\n\nThe lawsuit, AFGE along with watchdog groups Public Citizen and State Democracy Defenders Fund (SDDF), claim Trump and his Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \"do not represent the interests of everyday Americans... (they) will be considering cuts to government agencies and programs that protect health, benefits, consumer finance, and product safety.\"\n\nAs Trump's return-to-office mandate was expected to get major pushback from federal workers, the president is also threatening to take legal action against the latest AFGE contract which extended remote worker protections until 2029.\n\n“AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “This fight is about fairness, accountability, and the integrity of our government. Federal employees are not the problem—they are the solution.”\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nTrump travels to arena for inaugural rally\n\nDonald Trump was spotted on his way to the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., where he'll hold an inaugural rally with supporters.\n\nHe was supposed to participate in a parade to celebrate the start of his second term, but festivities were moved indoors due to the below-freezing cold in the nation's capital.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nHegseth advances in committee for Defense role\n\nA majority on the Senate Armed Services Committee voted in favor ot Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon.\n\nHegseth, a combat veteran and former Fox News host, will advance to the full Senate following the committee's party-line vote: 14-13.

Instead, she wore her red, white and blue knit cap and planned to visit some memorials.\n\n“It was important to take today to remember how blessed we are to live in the greatest country in the world,” said Bush, 35, of Oceanside, California.\n\nShe said it’s also important to bring people and the country together.\n\nDespite the frigid weather and snow, Ali Grzelak and her father, Steve, drove down from Monmouth, New Jersey on Sunday to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.\n\n“We’re just happy to be part of the atmosphere,’’ said Grzelak, 34, as she stood with Bush, a longtime friend, steps from the White House. “There’s like a spirit in the air.’’\n\nGrzelak had attended a Trump rally in New Jersey in 2020 and felt it was important to show support again.\n\n“Trump’s done so much for us, the least I can do is show up in some cold weather,’’ she said.\n\n– Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nTrump participates in pass in rev\n\nFollowing a ceremonial luncheon, Trump attended a proceeding known as the pass in review, when leaders observe and \"review\" processions of military troops.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens next on Inauguration Day?\n\nDonald Trump may have given his inaugural address, but that doesn't mean the ceremonies are over.\n\nThe presidential parade is kicking off next.

Denali in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe orders could undo with the flourish of a pen many of former President Joe Biden's key efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, protect federal lands from oil drilling and enshrine the civil rights of transgender people. And they could grant the second Trump administration expansive authority to enforce border security and immigration laws.\n\n– Lauren Villagran, Elizabeth Weise, Erin Mansfield\n\nNo, Donald Trump didn't put his hand on the Bible\n\nTrump opted out of an inauguration tradition on Monday: He didn't place his hand on a Bible as he was sworn in.\n\nBut that doesn't change Trump's inauguration.

They should also be used by caregivers. But if you aren't sick or caring for someone who is, there's no need for a facemask. According to the center, they could be in short supply and should be preserved for caregivers.\n\nClean and disinfect often: Be sure to clean and disinfect the frequently touched objects like tables, keyboards, and doorknobs each day. The center has information available on disinfectants.\n\nMarch 20:\n\nThere remain no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Corpus Christi and South Texas.\n\nMore health department call-takers, a second testing site\n\nA fifth phone bank is being added to the existing four to help the health department answer a high volume of calls from residents who have questions related to COVID-19, said City Manager Peter Zanoni.\n\nA drive-thru sample collection site opened this week. Officials are working on setting up a second testing site, Zanoni said.\n\nCoastal Bend Blood Center urging residents to donate\n\nAs residents head warnings nationwide to socially distance themselves, blood centers are bracing for the impact.\n\nThe Coastal Bend Blood Center receives 30% of its blood donations through high school blood drives, which are all canceled now that schools are closed. Blood donations are down by 50% and as of Tuesday there are no blood drives planned, said Erin Survand, director of donor development and hospital services.\n\n\"Blood is a vital resource in our community,\" Survand said. \"People need it to live. We need people to continue to come out. Make appointments, go online, look at where our blood drives are located. If your organization is still open host a blood drive.\"\n\nThe blood bank is open 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Corpus Christi may be one of the largest remaining cities in the state still without a positive case of the virus but that may soon change.\n\nCity, county on board with governor's order\n\nNueces County, as of this afternoon, remains free of confirmed cases of coronavirus, officials say.\n\nIn a news conference, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb reiterated to residents the contents of the governor’s executive order issued earlier in the afternoon.\n\nIt goes into effect midnight Friday and remains in place through at least April 3.\n\nThey are not suggestions, McComb emphasized — the orders are enforceable and flagrant violations will be penalized.\n\nAlthough dining rooms and bars will close, McComb urged residents could take advantage of drive-thru and takeout options, which are permitted.\n\n“I would encourage — stronger than I can encourage — is for us to support our local restaurateurs,” he said. “They've got people working for them… if they shut down then it's going to have not just a health impact on our community, it's going to have an economic impact.”\n\nThe city and county are expected to amend their most recent emergency declarations to reflect state’s orders.\n\nDrive-thru testing site opens in Corpus Christi\n\nToday is the opening of the drive-thru testing site in the parking lot of the old Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital. The site is by appointment only, which means the general public should not go.\n\nCorpus Christi police set up barricades and a watch tower at the site early this morning in preparation for its opening. People in personal protective equipment approached the vehicles as they pulled into the lot. Four dump trucks surrounded the testing center to protect the privacy of those being tested.\n\nLocal health district officials have said several Nueces County residents have been tested over the last few days but so far those r", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2021/12/02/always-phone-hiding-screen-clues-your-partner-cheating/8800374002/", "title": "Here's how tech can tell that your partner is cheating on you", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nPeople underestimate intuition. If your gut tells you something is off, don’t ignore it.\n\nStalkerware is surprisingly easy to plant on someone’s phone, and trackers follow you online and offline. Tap or click for signs whether you’re being watched or just paranoid.\n\nTracking software is frightening. It’s designed to report exactly where you are and what you’re doing on your phone. Tap or click for signs tracking software on your phone and what you can do about it.\n\nBefore we get to the digital cheating crumbs, my best advice is to have an honest conversation with your partner. Couples therapy is an excellent place to dive into deeper issues. It's also a good idea to consult with an attorney before you begin looking to make sure you do not violate any federal or state laws.\n\n1. Glued to their devices\n\nIs your spouse or partner always glued to their phone or computer? Maybe work is crazy right now or perhaps they're busy chatting with someone.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nPay attention to the way they behave with their devices. Many people turn their phones away from others to protect their privacy, but most don't hide their phones from their spouses. The same goes for shuffling browser tabs or switching off a tablet.\n\nThese gestures are subtle and can suggest your partner is doing something they don’t want you to see.\n\nNotifications can give away cheaters, too. You don’t need to be up to no good to take control of your notifications, though. Tap or click for easy ways to end all the dinging and buzzing when you want a little peace.\n\n2. Apps can hide secret calls and texts\n\nIn the movies, people aren’t very sneaky. In real life, people go to great lengths to hide their indiscretions. Unless your partner is particularly daring, you're not going to see a chat app on their home screen or steamy messages in their text message folder.\n\nThere are plenty of apps for sharing messages, photos, videos and more that aren't what they appear. Calculator Pro+ is one example. It looks like a calculator but saves texts and call logs of secret contacts.\n\nTo get a better idea of what apps your spouse uses and how long, check their screen time report. Look for anything out of the ordinary. I’d say using a calculator app for four hours a week counts as odd.\n\nCheck screen time and usage on an iPhone:\n\n• Go to Settings > Screen Time. Choose See All Activity, then Week. This will show a summary of weekly use.\n\n• You can tap Day to see a daily use summary.\n\nCheck app usage on an Android:\n\n• Tap Settings > Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls > Dashboard to view screen times for each app.\n\n• Screen time shows what apps have been on screen and for how long.\n\n3. Look for a second number\n\nAn easy way to keep two romantic lives separate is to buy two separate phones. That way, the cheater doesn't get confused and text the wrong person by mistake. A second phone is also a liability, even if expressed as a \"work\" or \"emergency” phone.\n\nAnother technique is to purchase a separate SIM card. Some phones allow you to have two SIM cards that can be a hassle. A much easier way is to get a Google Voice number that rings on the current phone.\n\nAny new entries for people or companies you are unfamiliar with could be a ruse. Call the number and see who answers. It's a good idea to block your number.\n\nTap or click here for 5 ways to block or hide your number when making a call.\n\n4. Search every letter of the alphabet\n\nCheaters would have to be stupid not to clear the search histories on their browsers. If they routinely access dating sites, they will probably think to cover their tracks.\n\nAuto-fill is harder to remember. Search engines like Google do a remarkable job of guessing your search parameters based on everything you have ever searched before.\n\nIf you share a computer with a suspect spouse, you may intend to type “Megalodon” and instead, the words “Megan Granger home phone number” flash across the field. Take this a few steps further. Start typing each letter of the alphabet and see what pops up.\n\nTap or click for 10 hidden Google search features you should be using.\n\n5. Secret messages and online documents\n\nThe most dangerous habit for cheaters is to send photos and videos. These media may spice things up, but they are vivid evidence of an affair. Such materials can be used as evidence in divorce proceedings – especially if a betrayed husband or wife can save or download copies.\n\nIt’s easy work to embed an image into an audio or picture file secretly. Tools like OurSecret or QuickStego make this point-and-click work for the casual cheater. The snoop usually suspects nothing unusual. The files appear to be ordinary. You need to know a special keystroke or code to unlock the files.\n\nCheaters are also known to create online Google documents or Microsoft 365 files that look innocent until opened. The filename might be, for example, “Third quarter goals.” When the file is opened, the first page appears to be a bunch of corporate speak.\n\nBut scrolling down reveals the file's real purpose. The online document is a covert way to share notes, photos, and videos with someone else.\n\nNeed to send a message that stays private? Tap or click for my picks for encrypted emails and texts.\n\n6. Check cloud services, including Amazon Prime\n\nTo keep images and videos covert, cheaters may also use a particular cloud service. For example, the Keepsafe Photo Vault is designed to both store these media files and prevent others from accessing them. Many customers use Keepsafe for work or personal reasons, but if you notice that your spouse has a Keepsafe account and can’t figure out why, you may be onto something.\n\nTwo similar services are Vault and Hide It Pro, which were created to store photos and video and protect them with a PIN. They also function similarly to cloud services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Apple’s iCloud, but security is their top priority.\n\nBe sure to think out of the online cloud box. Check Amazon Prime because you get a free photo vault as part of your membership.\n\nAn Amazon Prime membership includes a whole lot more. Tap or click here for 20 ways to get more out of your Amazon account.\n\n7. Check the phone’s locations\n\nAs we become more reliant on GPS, you may also want to peek at your spouse’s location history. For Google users, the “previous destinations” menu option on the navigation system may chronicle your spouse’s movements; for Android users, the Google Timeline feature (found in the Google Maps app or Google Maps online) functions similarly.\n\nIf your spouse uses an iPhone, there is one place to be sure to look. Many people don’t even know this treasure trove of tracking exists.\n\nYou can find an iPhone user’s frequent locations in Settings, Privacy, Location Services, System Services and then Significant Locations. It takes a fair amount of effort to disable or delete these types of settings consistently, so if they are up to no good, you’re likely to find something.\n\nYou may want to turn off this feature on your own phone if this practice creeps you out. Tap or click here for steps on how to do it.\n\n8. Go through the trash\n\nDeleted digital items are typically never gone for good. A computer’s trash or recycle bin retains items until the bin is emptied. Cloud services such as DropBox let you restore items from the trash.\n\nEmails deleted accumulate in the trash until it's emptied. Voicemails on an iPhone are deleted, but they can be retrieved. Apps deleted from a phone can be restored too. If you're using carrier services, voicemails may be available on its site.\n\nIt can be all-consuming to find evidence of a cheater. Be sure you take care of yourself in the process.\n\nBonus Tip: Self-driving cars: Are they actually safe to drive?\n\nSelf-driving cars aren't some crazy future tech. They're here now. That raises some questions. Does it actually work? Is it safe? Is it work shelling out $8,000 for Tesla’s “full self-driving” option? To find out, I sat down with Consumer Report’s Head of Connected and Automated Vehicle Testing.

The GuideSafe Exposure Notification app was developed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Alabama Department of Health and the Birmingham-based tech company MotionMobs, Al.com reports. So far Alabama’s version of the app has only worked with other people who’d downloaded the state’s version. But on Thursday the app was connected to a wider network called the Association of Public Health Laboratories National Key Server. That connects apps created by 13 states and the District of Columbia. More states are to be added in the future. So far 150,000 users have downloaded Alabama’s notification app.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: New analysis suggests 2 out of 3 Alaska adults have at least one risk factor that health officials link with a higher chance of severe COVID-19 infection. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services findings indicate most adult Alaska residents are at an increased risk for hospitalization or worse after contracting COVID-19, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The risk factors include past or current smoking, obesity, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart disease or previous heart attacks. Other factors such as advanced age also make serious coronavirus infections more likely. The combination of advanced age and chronic disease raises the number of Alaska adults living with vulnerability to severe coronavirus experiences to 71%, said Ann Potempa, public health specialist with the state health department’s Chronic Disease Prevention section.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Northern Arizona University cracked down on students who hadn’t received mandatory coronavirus testing by locking them out of their online classes, a move that prompted most to get into compliance. University spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said about 25 students were notified early in the past week that they wouldn’t have continued access to the online instruction system because they didn’t get tests or seek an exemption even after three email notifications and a phone call, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. The system is used for all online materials, including the submission of assignments and exams. Faculty members heard about the crackdown from distressed students who were unable to access their accounts, Faculty Senate President Gioia Woods said. “We all agree that a culture of compliance is CRUCIAL to containing COVID-19,” Woods said in an email. “But to block students in the final week of the semester is harmful, especially for students most at risk. And to do so without letting faculty or department chairs know resulted in panic and confusion.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The pandemic is forcing some school districts in the state to adjust their operations and consider possibly switching to virtual instruction. Bryant Public Schools is seeing an increase in the number of positive cases and close contacts at its junior high and high school, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Devin Sherrill, Bryant’s director of communications, said the district might consider moving to remote learning for the rest of the semester after the Thanksgiving holiday if the situation does not improve. There are 60 active positive cases in the district, which has about 9,400 students and 1,000 staff members. C.B. Partee Elementary School, part of the Brinkley School District, switched to virtual learning Friday because of teacher absenteeism linked to sickness and a shortage of substitutes, the district said in a Facebook post. Students will return to on-site learning Nov. 30. The Little Rock School District, which experienced an increase in cases last week, announced that basketball practice at Central High School is canceled through Dec. 1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County announced new coronavirus-related restrictions Sunday that will prohibit in-person dining for at least three weeks as cases rise at the start of the holiday season, and officials statewide begged Californians to avoid traveling or gathering in groups for Thanksgiving. The new restrictions in Los Angeles County came as the California Department of Health and Human Services reported more than 15,000 coronavirus cases statewide Saturday – by far the highest level since the pandemic began in March. Another 14,000 cases were recorded Sunday. California’s average daily number of coronavirus cases has tripled in the past month, the Los Angeles Times found in an analysis, while COVID-19 hospitalizations have doubled in the same time period. LA County’s new rules take effect Wednesday at 10 p.m. Restaurants, breweries, wineries and bars will only be able to offer takeout, drive-thru and delivery services.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Denver Public Schools has gone to fully remote learning for all grades for the rest of the semester as the coronavirus surges, the district announced Wednesday. Remote learning began for more than 90,000 students in the state’s largest school district Monday and runs through the end of winter break. The district’s decision also applies to special education students. In September, the district reported about 13 new coronavirus cases weekly, mostly involving teachers and staff, when it first opened early childhood education classes. It said newly reported cases now have surpassed 300 per week, causing teacher and staff shortages and forcing individual schools to close. “This deeply challenges our ability to operate our schools. And we’ve already had to close many schools because we lack the staff to run them, due to required quarantines and the shortage of available substitutes,” Superintendent Susana Cordova said in a statement. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis had urged schools to remain open. He said data shows that transmission in elementary schools is lower than in many other activities, making it a safer option.\n\nConnecticut\n\nVernon: U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney has tested positive for the coronavirus and is isolating at home, he announced. Courtney said Sunday that he learned last week that he had been exposed to someone who later tested positive for the virus. “Upon learning of that initial exposure, I immediately began following the strict isolation guidelines laid out by the CDC and by my doctor while I waited to get a coronavirus test,” the Democrat said in a statement. The first test was negative, but the 67-year-old Courtney began to experience mild symptoms and got a second test, which came back positive, he said. Courtney, who represents Connecticut’s 2nd District, said he would continue to carry out his duties while in isolation at home. Courtney is the second member of the state’s five-member House delegation to contract COVID-19. Democrat Jahana Hayes tested positive for the virus in September.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The seven-day average daily coronavirus case count set an all-time high as the state tested a record number of people in the days before Thanksgiving. The state reported 486 new COVID-19 cases Sunday, raising the seven-day average of new cases to a record 428.4. On Wednesday, the state recorded nearly 11,000 tests, the most ever in one day. The numbers show more people in Delaware are seeking out a test, and a significant portion of them are returning positive results. The daily average percentage of tests that are positive is 5.9%, the highest it’s been since early June. The average daily case count has grown by 90% over the past two weeks. New restrictions that became effective Monday limit private indoor gatherings to 10 people. Gov. John Carney said last week that the state will rely on voluntary compliance and won’t be “knocking on doors” to enforce the restriction on Thanksgiving.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C.’s homeless population is feeling the effects of rising coronavirus risk, WUSA-TV reports. Nearly 10,000 Washingtonians are considered homeless per the city’s point-in-time annual count, and nurse practitioner Carolyn Summer, who works with Unity Health Care to treat vulnerable individuals, said anyone without a home to isolate is particularly at risk during the pandemic. She said D.C. has two types of emergency response sites in hotels. One type is an isolation and quarantine center to house those who were exposed to the coronavirus or tested positive. The other center, a Pandemic Emergency Program for Vulnerable Individuals, provides a home to those at the highest risk of developing severe symptoms if they contract the virus. For the homeless population now living in the PEPVI hotels, she said the pandemic has offered a silver lining. “Blood pressures are getting more under control; diabetes is getting under control,” she said. “So in addition to keeping people safe from COVID, we’re hopefully improving their health overall.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Calling the actions of the Publix supermarket chain before April 20 “shameful,” a Miami law firm filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the supermarket giant Monday morning for allegedly prohibiting employees from wearing protective masks and gloves during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lawsuit, filed by Michael Levine and Dax Bello of Stewart Tilghman Fox Bianchi & Cain, claims 70-year-old deli worker Gerardo Gutierrez died April 28 after contracting the virus from a co-worker at a Publix in Miami Beach. As the coronavirus began to spread throughout Florida, Publix made the decision to prohibit employees from wearing masks because of its belief that the masks would scare off customers, the lawsuit claims. “To find that Publix made this callous decision to say you can’t wear a mask is just shameful,” Levine said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Thousands of people jammed roads for miles Sunday to try to get boxes of food and gift cards donated by entertainer Tyler Perry. Tyler Perry Studios said it had enough boxes of canned vegetables and $25 gift cards for 5,000 families to drive through and pick up. The studio said it was out of food by 10 a.m. Sunday. The line started forming Saturday and at one point stretched for 5 miles south of downtown Atlanta, media outlets report. Volunteers in protective equipment were handing out the food and gift cards.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A group of organizations on the Big Island has distributed $7.5 million in federal funds to help pay rent and mortgages for 1,322 households during the COVID-19 economic and health crisis, officials said. The organizations used their backgrounds in homeless assistance and disaster response to establish uniform applications and coordinate to prevent duplication and delays in distribution of federal coronavirus recovery funds, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The organizations include Hawaiian Community Assets, Hawaii Community Lending, Hawaii First Federal Credit Union, Habitat for Humanity Hawaii Island, HOPE Services Hawaii, Hawaii Island Home for Recovery and Neighborhood Place of Puna. To help respond to the volume of Hawaii island renters and homeowners still seeking assistance, county officials issued an additional $1 million in federal funds Friday and plan to provide $1.4 million more this week, said Sharon Hirota, an executive assistant to Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Hunting license sales in the state are up as more residents seek a way to safely get out of the house without contracting COVID-19, but that has led to inexperienced hunters misidentifying and killing moose and a grizzly bear, wildlife officials say. In addition, blatant poaching has increased in northern Idaho. “Hunting is that outdoor activity that follows all the COVID recommendations and gets people outside,” Idaho Department of Fish and Game Enforcement Chief Greg Wooten said Friday. “They’re doing what they’re being asked to do. They just need to comply with the (wildlife hunting) laws.” He said poaching appears to be at normal levels throughout most of the state, and the agency has been trying to publicize incidents using social media in an attempt to catch poachers. Wooten said the most shocking incident for him has been the illegal killing of three moose in Valley County over a two-week period this fall. Two appear to be hunters who thought the moose was some other animal. Wooten said the third appeared to be a case of someone shooting a large bull and just leaving it to rot.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration is reminding local government officials of a Dec. 1 deadline to submit applications for federal relief from the coronavirus pandemic. Congress approved so-called Local CURE funds as part of a COVID-19 relief package last spring. The money must be spent by Dec. 30. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity reported it has initiated the process with the 1,400 eligible governments, but many have yet to complete required steps. DCEO said 503 local governments have received or will receive a total of $112 million thus far. But more than 400 government bodies are still eligible and have not completed applications. Eligible costs incurred between March 1 and Dec. 30 include payrolls for public health and public safety, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, emergency medical expenses, and public health spending necessary to comply with government orders.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The start of Gov. Eric Holcomb’s second term in January won’t include any large public celebrations because of coronavirus concerns, the head of the state Republican Party said Friday. Holcomb won a landslide reelection this month for another four years in office. The Republican entered office in 2017 with an inaugural ball at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in downtown Indianapolis and an inauguration ceremony attended by about 2,000 people at the state fairgrounds coliseum. “While we’d love to celebrate our historic victories together to usher in the second term of Governor Holcomb, the time just isn’t right to do so,” state Republican Chairman Kyle Hupfer said in a statement. “It remains our full intent to appropriately celebrate the governor’s reelection with the entire team that made it possible when circumstances allow.” Holcomb and Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch will legally take their oaths of office at some point before their new terms begin Jan. 11.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state surpassed 211,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,200 deaths Monday and remains ranked third-highest in the nation for virus positivity rate. There were 1,661 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours and 13 additional deaths, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. That raised the total number of cases identified in the state to 211,722, and the number of deaths rose to 2,205. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen over the past two weeks from nearly 18 deaths per day Nov. 8 to 29 deaths per day Nov. 22, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The daily number of cases has been ranging between 3,000 to 5,000 on most days this month, and the low daily count Monday is likely due to a significant decrease in test results posted in the past few days. Iowa’s seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate was 44.7% on Nov. 22, ranking third-highest third in the nation behind Wyoming and South Dakota, according to Johns Hopkins data. Those hospitalized with COVID-19 fell slightly to 1,333, but the 273 patients in intensive care was up 18 from Sunday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Legislature plans to spend about $3million on technology upgrades in hopes that people will be able to watch committee hearings and other functions even if they can’t leave their homes because of the coronavirus pandemic. The upgrades are designed to ensure that legislative committee rooms and even conference spaces are outfitted with audiovisual equipment to broadcast events to the public. The upgrades, which the Legislature’s top seven leaders approved Thursday, are planned as lawmakers are starting to consider exactly how the Legislature will conduct business after it convenes its next annual session in January. Most decisions are pending. Legislative leaders also could require plexiglass partitions in committee rooms, close the House and Senate galleries, and limit on who can enter the building. They also could require lawmakers to wear masks.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: As the state posts record-breaking numbers of COVID-19 cases and rising deaths, the state’s nursing homes and senior living sites are bracing for grim weeks ahead in facilities where residents and staff already have been hit hard by the coronavirus. Last week, the state enlisted the Kentucky National Guard to help at nursing homes suffering acute staff shortages because of workers who have been infected with the virus or forced to quarantine because they have been exposed on the job or in the community to COVID-19. “It’s taking a devastating toll on our staff and our residents,” said Tim Veno, president of LeadingAge Kentucky, which represents nursing homes and other providers. “It’s as if this infection never lets up.” Eric Friedlander, secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said state officials are preparing for a new round of nursing home infections as the virus spreads across the state. Already, nearly 15,000 nursing home residents and staff members statewide have tested positive for the virus since it first struck Kentucky on March 6. Of those, 1,119 residents and six workers have died.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s agriculture commissioner is urging farmers and ranchers to turn in their applications for federal coronavirus assistance ahead of next month’s deadline, and he’s worried some who are eligible may be missing out on available aid. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in May that it was giving out up to $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who suffered losses during the coronavirus pandemic, such as market disruptions, price declines and increased marketing costs. Another $14 billion was added to the assistance program in September. Louisiana Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said the deadline to apply through local Farm Service Agency offices is Dec. 11. “Eligibility is different for each program, and we think nurseries and specialty crop producers just aren’t aware that they could be eligible for assistance,” said Craig McCain, state executive director of the Farm Service Agency.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The University of Maine System is in the midst of an effort it called “safe departure testing” to avoid sending students home for Thanksgiving with the coronavirus. The goal of the effort is to avoid having students who might be infected but are not showing symptoms spread the virus to others, system Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. The system has 5,000 test results in hand and is working to isolate 31 cases of the coronavirus that would have gone undetected without the effort, he said. “We want all of our students home with their families as soon as they are cleared to travel, but we have made plans to support isolating students with extra care and comfort through the Thanksgiving holiday,” Molloy said. The UMaine System, which has more than 30,000 students, faculty and staff, has a total of 80 known cases of the coronavirus at the moment, the system said in a statement. The people who tested positive are in isolation, the system said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The mayor has vetoed two bills that would have required hospitality businesses to rehire laid-off workers in the city once they reopen and required hotels to retain staff if their owners change. The Baltimore City Council approved both bills by wide margins amid pushback from the hotel industry, but Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young called the bills government overreach when they got to his desk last week, The Baltimore Sun reports. “While I appreciate the intent of this bill and agree that the city needs to continue doing everything it can to help our service workers weather the COVID-19 pandemic, I cannot in good conscience sign this particular piece of legislation which overreaches the authority of the Council and of City Government,” Young wrote in his veto letter. The legislations were supported by Unite Here, a union that represents workers in the hospitality industry. Roxie Herbekian, Unite Here’s Local 7 president, said in a statement that Young’s claims “that the legislation oversteps the law is bogus.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state agency that owns and operates Boston Logan International Airport must cut about 25% of its workforce amid a $400 million budget deficit brought on by a steep drop in travel during the coronavirus pandemic, agency executives say. The savings will come from a combination of layoffs, voluntary buyouts of union and administrative workers, and furloughs of administrative staff, CEO Lisa Wieland told the Massachusetts Port Authority’s board Thursday, according to the Boston Herald. The voluntary program will begin immediately, and the layoffs are expected in January. Logan had 42 million passengers last year. This year, the “optimistic” forecast was 22 million, and the “worst case” was 13 million, according to Massport. Logan’s passenger numbers are down to what they were in the mid-1970s, Wieland said. Traffic last month was nearly 80% below October 2019.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A girl who was the center of a police controversy after being placed in handcuffs by officers when she was 11 years old has died of COVID-19 complications, her family said online Sunday. Honestie Hodges, 14, tested positive for the coronavirus Nov. 9 and was rushed to the Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital later that day, according to an online fundraising page set up by her grandmother, Alisa Niemeyer. Niemeyer posted an update Sunday to the fundraiser, writing, “It is with an extremely heavy heart that I have to tell all of you that my beautiful, sassy, smart loving Granddaughter has gone home to be with Jesus.” A spokesperson for Spectrum Health System, which includes Helen Devos Children’s Hospital, said Honestie’s condition was listed as critical Sunday morning but could not confirm her death, citing privacy concerns. A Grand Rapids police officer placed Honestie in handcuffs in December 2017 as police searched for one of her aunts suspected in a stabbing. Body camera footage shows Honestie crying and pleading with the officer not to cuff her. The incident sparked demands for justice.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials urged residents Monday to download a free app for their smartphones that will notify them if someone who’s been near them later tests positive for the coronavirus and will allow them to warn others anonymously if they test positive themselves. Tarek Tomes, the state’s information technology commissioner, stressed at a briefing for reporters that participation in COVIDaware MN is voluntary and that the system contains ample privacy safeguards for those who opt in. It uses exposure notification technology developed by Google and Apple that is already being used under different names in about 20 other states and 35 countries around the world to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. “If communities are willing to adopt the app, use it to report positive test results and follow health recommendations when notified of an exposure, this app can help us return to many of the activities we miss so much and save lives,” Tomes said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: A Gulf Coast casino has become one of many businesses nationwide to sue its insurer for refusing to cover business losses because of the coronavirus pandemic. Island View Casino Resort in Gulfport contends in the federal lawsuit that its insurer owes it $10 million for business losses caused by a 65-day COVID-19 shutdown in the spring. Gulfside Casino Partnership, Island View’s owner, is also demanding $90 million in punitive damages, attorney’s fees and interest. The Sun Herald reports Island View says it lost $46.2 million in revenue when it was closed from March 16 until May 21 under orders from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. However, its policy only covers up to $10 million. Gulfport attorney Joe Sam Owen, who represents the partnership, said legal disputes over COVID-19 insurance claims generally have boiled down to the definition of “physical damage.”\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Hospital beds across the state are nearly four-fifths full, and capacity is even more limited in intensive care units as the coronavirus pandemic continues its autumn surge. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services on Monday cited 2,805 hospitalizations statewide – double the number from a month ago. The state’s COVID-19 dashboard notes that just 21% of capacity remains at hospitals, and ICU capacity is down to 17%. Bed capacity is at 13% in northwest Missouri, 17% in the St. Louis region and 19% in Kansas City. ICU capacity is at 13% in the southwestern part of the state and in St. Louis. More than 100 patients are hospitalized at CoxHealth facilities in Springfield and elsewhere in the Ozarks region. Missouri Hospital Association spokesman David Dillon said staffing shortages at hospitals are also a major concern. And the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force said Friday that projections show the region’s hospitals maxing out intensive care units in a matter of days, so a field hospital is under consideration, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The growth of the state’s economy slowed in October after signs of recovery in months prior. Federal job figures released Friday showed that the growth in nonfarm payroll employment was 1,200 jobs, the lowest month of recovery since May, the Billings Gazette reports. There were 470,200 nonfarm payroll jobs in the state in October. About 64,300 nonfarm payroll jobs were lost in the state during the first two months of the pandemic, according to the labor bureau. Many of those jobs returned when businesses reopened with some restrictions and widespread stay-at-home orders were lifted in May. That month, 18,500 nonfarm jobs returned to the state. In June, another 14,500 jobs returned to the state. But increases in payroll jobs after June have been more modest. In July, the state added 2,900 jobs, and in August it added another 3,600 jobs. In September, the state gained 4,400 nonfarm payroll jobs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts warned at a press conference Monday that the state could impose tighter social distancing restrictions within the next few days if hospitalizations continue to rise. Nebraska reported one of its lowest numbers of new coronavirus cases this month Sunday, but the number of people hospitalized with the virus remains high and continues to strain hospital capacity in the state. The potential restrictions would limit indoor gatherings to 10 people, outdoor gatherings to 25, and bars to carry-out and delivery services. “It could be as early as this week,” Ricketts said. “It could be before Thanksgiving that we could see that threshold go into place.” State health department data shows 976 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals, slightly below the record of 987 set Friday. Patients with COVID-19 are occupying 23% of the state’s hospital beds, approaching the threshold of 25% that will trigger new restrictions.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced plans Sunday to tighten restrictions on casinos, restaurants and private gatherings such as Thanksgiving dinner in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The new restrictions, scheduled to go into effect Tuesday, come amid an unprecedented surge that has broken records in the state in terms of cases, deaths and infection rates throughout November. Sisolak, who has avoided tightening mandates throughout the fall due to the havoc they could wreak on Nevada’s tourism-based economy, said the trends led to an “inescapable conclusion.” “We are on a rapid trajectory that threatens to overwhelm our health care system, our front-line health workers and your access to care. So it’s time to act,” said Sisolak, who recently contracted COVID-19. The new restrictions reduce the capacity limits for high-risk areas including restaurants, bars, gyms, places of worship and casinos. They will also be applied to public and private gatherings, limiting them to no more than 10 people, from no more than two households.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: At least 100 people protested Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s mask mandate, chanting, “Breathe free or die,” and “We will not comply,” outside his home in Newfields on Sunday. Sununu issued an executive order that took effect Friday requiring masks to be worn in public spaces, indoors or outside, when social distancing isn’t possible. Protest organizer Frank Staples, working with a group called Absolute Defiance, was asked Sunday why the protest was held outside Sununu’s home rather than at the Statehouse. “The Statehouse is closed,” Staples said. “He has shut everything down and is running the government from his house, so right now this is the Statehouse. We will be here every weekend till he ends his executive orders and the state of emergency.” Sununu had previously resisted calls for a statewide mandate but said last week that one was appropriate given the rising percentage of positive test results, the doubling of the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past two weeks, new outbreaks at five nursing homes and an “incredibly alarming rate” of asymptomatic community transmission. The order expires Jan. 15.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Gov. Phil Murphy’s family had their meal interrupted after two people began cursing at the governor over his COVID-19 policies. A 36-second video clip of the incident spread over social media after it was posted on Facebook on Sunday afternoon. At least two women appear to be yelling at Murphy off camera, saying, “Oh my God, Murphy. You are such a (expletive).” Seconds later, after Murphy’s son Josh asks one of the women to put on her mask, she tells him, “You can go (expletive) yourself.” “You know why I don’t need to wear a mask. Because there ain’t nothing (expletive) wrong with me,” one woman says. Josh Murphy then points to the woman’s cellphone case, saying, “I like your Trump phone case. Guess who Trump likes. He likes my dad.” The woman responds with more cursing. The governor does not speak to the women and continues to eat his meal.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State lawmakers are drafting legislation aimed at providing about $300 million in direct economic aid for the unemployed, small businesses and emergency housing subsidies. The proposal is aimed at providing a jolt of relief to a state economy reeling from a surge in pandemic infections and deaths. A renewed stay-at-home order has halted in-person activity at nonessential businesses through at least Nov. 30 and limits capacity at grocery stores, drugstores and hardware stores. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled a one-day special session for Tuesday in hopes of delivering weekly supplemental unemployment checks of $300 shortly after Thanksgiving. The statewide unemployment rate was 8.1% in October, well above the 6.9% national rate. New Mexico depleted its unemployment insurance fund in September and has begun borrowing money from the federal government to fulfill claims.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A Brooklyn synagogue should be investigated over reports that it hosted a secret wedding with thousands of unmasked guests earlier this month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. “If that happened, it was a blatant disregard of the law,” Cuomo said during a briefing in New York City. “It’s illegal. It was also disrespectful of the people of New York.” The New York Post reports guests, mostly unmasked, crammed inside the Yetev Lev temple in Williamsburg for the Nov. 8 wedding of Yoel Teitelbaum, a grandson of Satmar Grand Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, in blatant violation of coronavirus restrictions that ban large indoor gatherings. The synagogue has a capacity of 7,000 people. Organizers kept the wedding secret after state officials canceled an earlier Satmar wedding, the Post reports, citing a Yiddish newspaper, Der Blatt. A spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city is investigating.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Despite a recent spike in COVID-19 cases, shopping malls and other local stores saw a lot of traffic as hundreds of people elected to get a head start on their holiday shopping Saturday. “I know some people will say that holiday shopping is a nonessential reason to get out during a pandemic, but I disagree,” Asheville resident Jacob Pima said. While most people who browsed through the Asheville Mall, Asheville Outlets and stores along Biltmore Avenue wore face coverings, several patrons elected not to as they shopped for holiday items. Shoppers admitted to shopping primarily online but cited a desire to visit stores in person to support local businesses as a reason to risk being out during a pandemic. The health crisis has forced many lifestyle adjustments. The financial effects of COVID-19 have made this holiday shopping season more difficult for Pima, and splurging on gifts for family and friends won’t be an option this year, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials are rolling out free rapid coronavirus testing for teachers, staff and school administrators this week as part of a pilot project designed to slow the virus’s spread by identifying and quickly isolating people who may be asymptomatic. Testing of K-12 teachers will start in the Fargo and West Fargo school districts and will be expanded to other districts in coming days and weeks. Teachers, staff and administrators who work closely with students are being encouraged to get tested weekly through Dec. 31. Students will not be tested as part of the effort. State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said the rapid testing will add an additional layer to strong mitigation strategies schools are already using to keep in-person learning safe. North Dakota ranks first in the country in new COVID-19 cases per capita, with 2,418 per 100,000 people over the past two weeks. One in every 86 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A customer left a $3,000 tip for a single beer as a restaurant voluntarily closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The man walked into Nighttown on Sunday in Cleveland, ordered the beer and asked for the check, which came to $7.02, owner Brendan Ring wrote on Facebook. Ring said the man wished him well and told him to share the tip with the four employees who were working brunch service. As the man walked out, Ring wrote, he looked down at the tip and “realized he left a whopping $3,000.” “I ran after him and he said no mistake we will see you when you reopen!” Ring said he would not post the customer’s name because he thinks the man wouldn’t want that. The owner said he and his serving staff were “humbly grateful for this incredibly kind and grand gesture.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The City Council on Tuesday is to vote on whether to extend a citywide mask mandate in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The council will consider extending the mandate, which was first approved in July and has been extended twice already, from Dec. 7 to Jan. 22. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen from 1,735 new cases per day Nov. 8 to 2,886 on Sunday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths increased from 13 to 15 per day during the same time period. The state health department on Monday reported 3,544 new cases and 15 additional deaths due to the illness caused by the virus for totals of 177,874 cases and 1,649 deaths since the start of the pandemic. The department reported 1,495 people hospitalized either with the virus or under investigation for infection.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Nearly three dozen current and incoming state lawmakers have sent a letter to Gov. Kate Brown demanding an immediate increase in coronavirus testing statewide as case numbers spike, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The letter sent last week by 32 Republican and Democratic lawmakers from the Willamette Valley emphasized that California and Washington surpass Oregon in the number of people tested but that Oregon’s test positivity rate is much higher than in those states. Oregon’s rate recently topped 12%, while California’s is 5.6%, and Washington’s is 4.8%. The Oregonian/OregonLive found that the number of people tested now barely exceeds the number tested in July. Oregon is now identifying an average of nearly 990 new cases a day, a record. Brown has not responded to the bipartisan letter. “We cannot afford to continue with the current testing systems in place today,” the lawmakers wrote to Brown, a Democrat. “Oregonians need certainty and they need access to testing.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPunxsutawney: The coronavirus pandemic means Groundhog Day won’t be the same in this town long associated with a prognosticating rodent. Organizers said Punxsutawney Phil will predict whether spring will come early or winter will last longer in 2021 without the usual crowds who gather at Gobbler’s Knob, a tiny hill just outside the town about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Phil and his inner circle will deliver the Feb. 2 prediction virtually by means of a live internet stream and website, organizers said. “But it has been determined that there will not be any in-person attendance or guests on the grounds as the potential COVID risks to overcome are too great.” Organizers will continue to monitor the pandemic in case the situation changes. The annual event has its origin in a German legend that says if a furry rodent casts a shadow on Feb. 2, winter continues. If not, spring comes early.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 1 out of every 4 households in the state struggled over the summer to put food on the table amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released Monday. Despite federal assistance, 25% of households were worried about having adequate food, up from 9.1% last year and the highest level of food insecurity in Rhode Island in 20 years, according to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s annual Status Report on Hunger. “That’s shocking,” CEO Andrew Schiff said. The food insecurity caused by the pandemic has hit families of color particularly hard. “Where 21% of white households lack adequate food, 36% of Black households and 40% of Latinx households are food insecure,” the report said. The United Way of Rhode Island received nearly 60,000 calls for food assistance between March and August, a 77% increase from the same period in 2019. The figures are based on a random sample of 2,100 households surveyed in July and August as part of the RI Life Index, an initiative of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Hunters bagged about 100 fewer alligators in the state this hunting season than last year. The Post and Courier reports that just 243 gators were bagged from September to October. The state Department of Natural Resources said cooler temperatures, rain and COVID-19 could all be factors for the decrease. “I don’t know if that was a combination of weather or a combination of weather and COVID,” Jay Butfiloski, the department’s alligator program coordinator, told the Post and Courier. “It was definitely a strange year all around, as everybody can attest.” More than 7,000 people from 47 states applied to hunt alligators in South Carolina this year. The department drew 1,000 applicants from a lottery. Three 13-foot-long gators were reported to the agency, and one processing company said it received a gator from Lake Moultrie weighing 758 pounds.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The spread of the coronavirus in the state continued to ease Monday, with the South Dakota Department of Health reporting 783 new cases, though hospitalizations rose further. That brought the seven-day average of new cases to 1,081, down from the high of 1,458 on Nov. 14. The state also reported 4,344 new tests, which brought the seven-day average for tests to a new high: 6,608. The state’s active infections increased to 17,350, with 330 recoveries. The number of people hospitalized increased by five to 582. South Dakota has reported 175 deaths in the past week. The number of deaths that the state reports is typically lower immediately after the weekend.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: Middle Tennessee State University communications students got a chance to produce a real-world advertising campaign this fall encouraging their fellow students to wear masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Their campaign focused on everyday challenges like parking, finding a spot to study, or remembering a student ID, and it pointed out that wearing a mask was easier than all of these, according to the school. The students even encouraged teachers to add their own “it’s easier than …” comparisons on syllabi and in the classroom. “We realized that the fact-based messaging just isn’t working,” said Bella Utley, a senior advertising major. “This had to be concise, easy to digest and hit on an emotional level for students.” The promotions all end with the tag line “Wear Your Mask. Defend True Blue.”\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: The city is using one family’s brush with the coronavirus as a warning to others who might be considering big get-togethers this Thanksgiving. Alexa Aragonez told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that her family weighed the risks of catching the virus but decided to get together for a birthday party Nov. 1. A couple of days later, her 57-year-old mother, Enriqueta Aragonez, and others who were at the party began to feel sick. They got tested, and all 12 who attended were positive for the virus. Three other people with whom they had come in contact also tested positive, said Alexa Aragonez, 26, who didn’t attend. In a video as part of the city’s public awareness campaign, Enriqueta Aragonez says from the hospital, “I went to my nephew’s house and love seeing my family. But now I’m fighting against COVID-19.” She is now recovering at home, and although she doesn’t need supplemental oxygen, she still has pain in her lungs, Alexa Aragonez said. “We were scared that my mother, the matriarch of the family, was going to pass,” she said. “So I think that fear in our hearts made us want to put an awareness in the hearts of others.”\n\nUtah\n\nLevi: Prosecutors have filed charges against a person who hosted a Halloween party in this Provo-Orem suburb. The city of Levi said Thursday that police shut down a party at a commercial building after receiving a nuisance complaint on Halloween day. The city prosecutor charged the event host with a health order violation, nuisance violation and disorderly conduct. The property owner was charged with a nuisance violation, fire code violation and health order violation, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Coronavirus cases have substantially increased in the state in recent weeks. A week before Halloween, Gov. Gary Herbert had warned residents that the state’s health system was near capacity as a result of the pandemic. Public health officials have asked residents to avoid large gatherings during the holidays.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Snowmobilers can still enjoy the sport this winter amid the COVID-19 pandemic as long as they abide by the governor’s emergency orders, officials say. Out-of-staters can come to Vermont and snowmobile if they quarantine for 14 days in their second home or rented home, the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers announced last week. They can also quarantine for seven days and then get a negative coronavirus test report to carry with them on the VAST trails, the Caledonian Record reports. This winter, riders must stay in their family groups, follow social distancing and wear masks whenever they take off their helmets, said Roger Gosselin, who represents Orleans County on the VAST board of directors. Vermont’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Vermont has risen over the past two weeks from 24 new cases per day Nov. 7 to 100 on Nov. 21.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles announced Monday that commercial drivers will now be allowed to renew their licenses online, due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Commercial driver’s license holders previously were required to visit DMV offices in person to renew their credentials. The change in policy comes as the DMV struggles to clear a large backlog of in-person appointments caused by office closures during the first few months of the pandemic. DMV centers are now open by appointment-only, but many are booked three months out. “We are continually looking for ways to assist our customers during these challenging times,” DMV Commissioner Richard Holcomb said in a news release. “The opportunity to renew online gives our commercial driving community a convenient service option and focus office appointment opportunities on transactions for customers who need in-person assistance.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The number of people hospitalized to receive treatment for the coronavirus has reached a record high in the state, forcing hospitals to make changes to meet the influx of patients, health officials said. There were 762 people receiving hospital care for the virus in Washington as of Saturday, KOMO-TV reports. “I am very, very worried about it,” Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Leaders from hospitals statewide met last week to consider strategies to ensure they have room to care for COVID-19 patients as the hospitalization rate climbs. “Every hospital is now making a plan for how they’re going to cancel elective surgeries, so they’re looking at their cases, especially those that would require long hospital stays after surgery, and making plans that they may need to cancel those,” Sauer said. The cancellations under consideration to make room for coronavirus patients include joint and heart valve replacements and some cancer surgeries, Sauer said. At the Swedish First Hill campus of Seattle’s Swedish Medical Center, 10 coronavirus patients were admitted within a span of five hours Wednesday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has again smashed a weekly record for confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Health officials said there were 5,153 confirmed cases of the virus statewide last week, up 11.4% from the old record of 4,623 positive cases set the previous week. In the past month, the number of active cases has more than doubled to at least 13,678. Infection rates in 19 counties have forced school systems to suspend in-person instruction. Gov. Jim Justice and leaders remain reluctant to impose new restrictions on businesses and public life. The state has instead focused on mask-wearing and increased testing. “In some areas, COVID is spreading fast enough that perhaps some focused and precise strategies will need to be done,” said Clay Marsh, a West Virginia University official leading the state’s coronavirus response, speaking at a news conference with Justice. “This is certainly the governor’s and his leadership’s decision.” Winter youth sports may be further delayed, Justice said, after he pushed their start to Jan. 11, which he said is “looking really tough” now.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law firm asked the state Supreme Court on Monday to immediately block Dane County’s ban on indoor gatherings and indoor sports, arguing the order will ruin Thanksgiving and subject young athletes to mental trauma. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed a petition with the high court on behalf of two parents of young athletes and an indoor gymnasium. The petition asks the justices to take the case directly without waiting for it to wind through lower courts and issue an immediate injunction blocking the ban. The firm argues the high court should take the case because many counties have been expanding their coronavirus ordinances, and the state needs clarification on how much power local elected officials can delegate to health departments. Janel Heinrich, the director of Dane County and the city of Madison’s joint health department, has “egregiously” seized power and is ruling the county and city “by decree,” the firm contends. The health department’s spokeswoman, Sarah Mattes, said the agency is trying to protect people’s health using science and data.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State health officials have reported an increase of 742 confirmed coronavirus cases from Saturday to Sunday. There were 24,309 confirmed cases as of Sunday compared to the 23,567 cases reported Saturday, The Wyoming Eagle Tribune reports. Natrona County, which includes Casper, reported the highest number of new cases at 115, officials said. Laramie County, which includes Cheyenne, reported 105 new cases, while Fremont County reported the next highest number at 95. Statewide, the number of active COVID-19 cases increased from 10,704 on Saturday to 11,186 on Sunday, or by 482 cases, health officials said. The number of active cases in Laramie County was 1,588, an increase of 60 from Saturday to Sunday. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/24"}]}

He's lived a remarkable life.", "text": "Standing the test of time requires excellence – whether it be in film, art, literature, music, TV.\n\nOr athletics. LeBron James has stood the test of time, like all the greats.\n\nYou turn 40 on Monday, LeBron. What a life. Incredible. Unreal. Surreal.\n\nA kid from Akron, Ohio, with modest means but a ton of support and talent. But you also knew you had to work. And you did. Still, the odds were not in your favor.\n\nBut here you are, in your 22nd NBA season, a pro basketball career that ranks among the greatest of all-time.\n\nGo back to 1984 when you were born. Prince’s \"Purple Rain\" debuted that year. Think of all of the hits on that album that have stood the test of time. It’s an all-time classic.\n\nSome of the very best things in life are timeless.\n\nHappy Birthday, LeBron. Enjoy.\n\nHere's 40 defining moments from LeBron James' career:\n\n1. James gets his first bucket (of many more to come)\n\nOn Oct. 29, 2003, LeBron James, 18 at the time, made his NBA debut against the Kings. Three minutes into the game, James laced a baseline jumper from the right side for his first career basket. He’d end up with 25 points, nine assists, six boards and four steals.\n\n2. The Block in Cavaliers' championship clincher\n\nIn Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, James, a native of Akron, Ohio, delivered the Cavaliers their first championship and the city’s first championship in 52 years. He recorded 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists and came up with a game-saving block with 1:51 left in the fourth quarter of a 93-89 victory, helping the Cavs become the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit and win in the Finals.\n\n3. Forcing Game 7 in Finals vs. Warriors\n\nIn Games 5 and 6 of the 2016 Finals, James scored 41 points in each must-win game – he added 11 assists, four steals and three blocks in Game 6 and 16 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and three blocks in Game 5.\n\n4. James wins Rookie of the Year\n\nAfter averaging 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.6 steals in 79 appearances, James won the NBA Rookie of the Year award for the 2003-04 season. James helped the Cavs post an 18-win improvement from the season previous, or a 105.9% increase.\n\n5. Another Eastern Conference title\n\nNearing the end of James’ second stint with the Cavs and eight consecutive Finals appearances, James had 35 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists and two blocks in an 87-79 Game 7 victory over Boston in the Eastern Conference finals on May 27, 2018.\n\n6. James creates the LeBron James Family Foundation\n\nIn 2004, James started his foundation that initially gave out bikes and backpacks before evolving into after-school programs. The foundation was the precursor to the creation of a public school in his hometown of Akron. The foundation also provides rent-free housing to more than a dozen families, when needed.\n\n7. Playoff buzzer-beater vs. Raptors\n\nJames hit an improbable, game-winning one-handed runner off the glass as the fourth quarter expired for his 37th and 38th points, giving Cleveland a 105-103 victory and 3-0 series lead against Toronto on May 5, 2018.\n\n8. 30K points\n\nOn Jan. 23, 2018, James became the youngest player to reach 30,000 points.\n\n9. Getting closer to scoring record\n\nOn Feb. 18, 2021, James joined Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players with 35,000 or more points, reaching that number faster and younger than the other two players.\n\n10. James sets another record, this time in an All-Star Game\n\nIn the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, at the age of 21, James became the youngest player in NBA history to win an NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player award. James dropped 29 points, six rebounds and two assists in a 122-120 Eastern Conference victory. James would go on to win the award two more times (2008 and 2018), tying for second most all-time with Michael Jordan, Shaquille O’Neal, and Oscar Robertson.\n\n11. No. 1 all-time leading scorer in NBA history\n\nJames became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer on Feb. 7, 2023, passing Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on a mid-range fadeaway jump shot against Oklahoma City with his wife, Savannah, sons, Bronny and Bryce, and daughter, Zhuri, and mom, Gloria, in attendance.\n\n12. Big screen debut\n\nIn July 2015, James made his movie debut in \"Trainwreck\" starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. James plays himself and received praise for his role as the friend of Hader’s character.\n\n13. Twenty-five straight\n\nIn his first Eastern Conference finals appearance, in a pivotal Game 5 on the road against the Pistons with the series tied at two games apiece, James went off with a 48-point outburst. But what was most impressive was how he finished the game. It went to double overtime, and it was James who willed the Cavs; from the final 2:17 of regulation and through the 10 combined minutes of the pair of overtimes, James scored the Cavaliers' final 25 points. Cleveland won, 109-107, in a massive result that set up its Game 6 victory and a trip to James’ first NBA Finals.\n\n14. 40,000 and counting\n\nOn March 2, 2024, James’ layup against the Denver Nuggets gave him 40,000 career points, making him the first player to hit the 40,000 mark as he continues to make it more difficult to break his all-time scoring record.\n\n15. James' historic MVP run\n\nJames almost certainly will trail Michael Jordan and Bill Russell for most career Most Valuable Player awards (five), but James had a near-unprecedented run from 2008 until 2013. James won the NBA MVP award four times in five seasons, joining Russell as the only players to do so.\n\n16. 'The Decision'\n\nThough he would later say he regretted the way he handled his televised announcement that he’d be leaving the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat, James infamously said “I’m going to take my talents to South Beach” on July 8, 2010. While James has faced some criticism for the announcement, it took place at a Boys and Girls Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, and generated around $4 million for charity.\n\n17. James makes his debut with the Heat\n\nOn Oct. 26, 2010, James made his Heat debut in a loss against the Celtics, scoring 31 points, with four rebounds, three assists and eight turnovers.\n\n18. Scoring, rebounding and passing\n\nShortly after reaching 40,000 points, James recorded his 11,000th assist on April 14, 2024, and he became the first player with 40,000 points, 11,000 rebounds and 11,000 assists. Whoever joins James in that category someday probably isn’t even in the NBA yet.\n\n19. James leads Lakers to bubble title\n\nTo win a championship in the Orlando bubble during COVID in 2020, it was agreed mental toughness was a key component. James and the Lakers had it. The Lakers won their 17th title and James won his fourth ring, in addition to his fourth Finals MVP, in a six-game series against Miami. James averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, 8.5 assists and shot 59.1% from the field and had a triple-double (28 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists) in the series finale.\n\n20. A 50-point Finals performance\n\nJames scored 51 points against Golden State in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals – and the Cavs lost 124-114 in overtime. Just seven players have scored at least 50 in a Finals game and James is the only player to lose. James’ frustration was at an all-time high after the game in which J.R. Smith seemingly tried to run out the clock in regulation with the score tied.\n\n21. Dropping 50 at the Garden\n\nJames has 14 games with 50 or more points and all but three were on the road, and the Knicks were the recipient of two of those 50-point games at Madison Square Garden. He had 50 points at MSG on March 5, 2008, and had 52 at MSG on Feb. 4, 2009.\n\n22. James, Heat rip off historic 27-game win streak\n\nFrom early February to late March in 2013, James helped lead the Heat on a 27-game winning streak that ended up as the third-longest in NBA history, behind the Golden State Warriors (28 games; twice, in 2014-15 and 2015-16) and the Los Angeles Lakers (33 games; 1971-72). During the streak, James averaged 27 points per game.\n\n23. We Want Justice\n\nA few days before the winning streak would end, James posted a photo to his Twitter account of the entire Heat team wearing hooded sweatshirts and looking down, in homage to Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old unarmed Florida teen who was shot to death by a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer. James posted the photo alongside the hashtags: “#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice.” This would be a pivotal moment for James as an outspoken advocate for social justice causes.\n\n24. Passing Kobe on scoring list\n\nJames passed Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time scoring list on Jan. 25, 2020 in Philadelphia, and following the game James recalled meeting with Bryant when James was in high school. The next day, Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others died in a helicopter crash in California.\n\n25. James wills Heat in iconic Game 6 performance vs. Celtics\n\nIn the 2012 Eastern Conference finals, the Heat were facing elimination on the road, down 3-2. This was coming one year after the Heat lost to the Mavericks in the 2011 NBA Finals, and James and the Big Three were facing criticism over a lack of results. James set the tone early on with a fierce, intentional, efficient performance, attacking the rim and going 12-of-14 from the field in the first half. He finished the game with 45 points and 15 boards on a 19-of-26 (73.1%) day from the floor. The Heat would go on to pull away in the fourth quarter of Game 7 to take the series.\n\n26. James wins first NBA title\n\nThe Heat overpowered the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games in 2012, and James won his first career NBA championship and his first NBA Finals Most Valuable Player after he averaged 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists per game in the series.\n\n27. 'For 3 for the win …'\n\nIn Game 2 of the 2009 Eastern Conference finals against the Magic, after Orlando upset Cleveland to take the first game at home, James rattled in a 3-point shot over Hedo Türkoğlu at the buzzer to win the game. The Cavs, however, lost the series 4-2.\n\n28. James launches school in Akron\n\nThe LeBron James Family Foundation in the summer of 2018 opened the I Promise School in conjunction with Akron Public Schools to “help some of Akron’s most challenged students with education and support (and) provide educational, career and emotional support for parents.\"\n\n29. An amazing double-digit scoring streak\n\nThe last time LeBron James scored less than 10 points in a game was Jan. 5, 2007. Since then, starting with 19 points against the New Jersey Nets on Jan. 6, 2007, he has scored at least 10 in 1,250 consecutive games. Michael Jordan is second on the list at 866. The next longest active streak is 207 games by Kevin Durant. It’s another one of James’ records that won’t be broken for a long time.\n\n30. The rim-shattering dunks\n\nThroughout his career James has become known for some of the most powerful dunks, like his very first one, this one, this one, and most definitely this one. Or, just watch a compilation like the one below.\n\n31. Paris gold\n\nJames won his third gold medal and was named MVP at the 2024 Paris Olympics, averaging 14.2 points, 10.2 assists and 8.2 rebounds with a triple-double (16 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists) in the semifinals vs. Serbia and double-double (14 points, 10 assists) vs. France in the gold-medal game.\n\n32. Historical father-son NBA combo\n\nIn a proud dad moment unequaled in NBA history, LeBron and Bronny became the first father-son duo to play in the NBA at the same time when the Lakers star and Lakers rookie were on the court in the 2024-25 season opener.\n\n33. Multi-media entrepreneur\n\nJames founded with business partner Maverick Carter a media company, now called Springhill Company, that launched in 2014 and has expanded into the world of documentaries, talk shows and podcasts.\n\n34. James loses his headband, takes control in Game 6 against Spurs\n\nThis 2013 Finals game will go down as the one Ray Allen tied with a miracle 3 in the final seconds, but James dominated the fourth quarter to keep Miami competitive. It just so happened that a trademark James scoring outburst happened after he lost his headband on an alley-oop dunk when a Spurs defender swiped at him. James had 15 points in the fourth quarter, 11 of which came after he lost the headband.\n\n35. James wins his second NBA title, second Finals MVP\n\nJames dropped 37 and 12 in Game 7, clinching Miami’s second (and eventually final) title in the James era. He also won his second NBA Finals MVP after averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds and seven assists in the series.\n\n36. Supporting democracy\n\nIn June 2020, James – and other Black athletes and entertainers – started More Than A Vote to ensure voting rights for African-Americans. “This is the time for us to finally make a difference,” James told The New York Times.\n\n37. A most reliable scorer\n\nJames now has 1,512 games with at least 10 points, and he passed Abdul-Jabbar earlier this season as the all-time leader for games with 10 or more points. Of James’ 1,520 career regular-season games, he has scored less than 10 points just eight times.\n\n38. LeBron goes off for 61\n\nOn March 3, 2014, in what would be his final months with the Heat, James erupted for a still-career high 61 points against the Charlotte Bobcats. James went 22-of-33 from the field (66.7%), including an absurd 8-of-10 from 3-point range. The Heat won 127-107.\n\n39. Putting in the time\n\nIn 20-plus years in the NBA, a player will log significant minutes. Earlier this month, James passed Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leader in minutes played. James (57,578 minutes) is one of seven players to hit 50,000 minutes played and is on pace to become the first to hit 58,000 minutes. James has another 11,858 minutes when the playoffs are included.\n\n40. The gift that keeps on giving\n\nOn Dec. 25 this season, James became the all-time leader in Christmas victories with 11, breaking a tie with his former teammate and friend Dwyane Wade, and extended his record for most points on Christmas to 507 – ahead of Kobe Bryant’s 395.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/sport/chet-holmgren-debut-nba-summer-league-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Chet Holmgren: No. 2 overall pick shines in NBA Summer League ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHe came in with a lot of hype and expectation, and in his first professional outing, Chet Holmgren shone.\n\nThe No. 2 overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder donned the blue jersey for the first time on Tuesday in the NBA Summer League.\n\nThe Summer League is an off-season competition in which teams predominately play rookies, second year and fringe NBA players to give minutes to developing talents and see who fits and who doesn’t.\n\nIn the 98-77 victory over the Utah Jazz, Holmgren wowed the fans in his 24 minutes on the court, setting records as he went.\n\nThe 20-year-old big man finished with 23 points – including 4-of-6 attempts from three-point range – seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nHolmgren drives against Vic Law of the Utah Jazz. Alex Goodlett/Getty Images\n\nHe also finished with six blocks, the most ever in an NBA Summer League game.\n\nWhen he was told afterwards that he had broken the block record, Holmgren said he wanted more. “Only six? That’s the record? Oh, well I’m coming to break it again,” he told ESPN in his post-game TV interview.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Holmgren became the first player in Summer League history to record at least five blocks and hit four three-pointers.\n\nPlaying alongside much of the Thunder’s vast array of young talent – Josh Giddey, Alekesej Pokusevski, Jaylin Williams and Jalen Williams – Holmgren’s size and shooting ability stood out immediately.\n\nThe seven-footer from Gonzaga locked up the paint with his size and displayed some of the crafty offensive skills he’s already learned.\n\nHe emphatically dunked the ball to score his first points, hit a three-point shot in the face of seven-foot-six Tacko Fall and hit a fadeaway mid-range shot that bore an uncanny similarity to NBA Hall-of-Famer Dirk Nowitzki.\n\n“Shout out to my teammates for setting me up, talking to me, just putting me in position to be successful,” Holmgren said, with his arm around Giddey.\n\n“Shout out to this guy right here,” he said, pointing to Giddey. “Double-double with assists. Great night for him and that helped me out a lot.”\n\nHolmgren speaks with teammate Giddey. Alex Goodlett/Getty Images\n\nGiddey was effusive in his praise of Holmgren. “The hype that he came in with, the way he played tonight was big for us,” the Australian guard said.\n\n“Being a high pick like that, there’s a lot of pressure coming in, and he handled it as good as he could’ve. It makes my job easy playing with someone like him. He can stretch the floor, finish at the rim. He protects me, he’s got my back on the defensive end. So love playing with him. It’s been one game, and the chemistry’s only getting stronger.”\n\nThe Thunder’s coaching staff was also impressed by Holmgren’s debut performance.\n\n“I thought he was really good offensively. The thing that impressed me the most with him was how well he played within our style,” Kameron Woods, the Thunder’s summer league team coach, said.\n\n“He obviously had a great game, but the most impressive part to me was he did it within our offense. It looked like team basketball out there and he found success within what we’re doing.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2014/07/16/tamika-catchings-conversation-best-female-basketball-player-ever/12752975/", "title": "Is Tamika Catchings the best women's basketball player ever?", "text": "David Woods\n\nIndyStar\n\nIt's easy to ignite discussion in a bar or chat room on who's the greatest male basketball player of all time. M.J. or Kareem? Wilt or Russell? What about LeBron?\n\nWhat about the female players?\n\nThat might be a more difficult conversation. Not because there aren't candidates, but because it's a list that can't easily be pared.\n\n\"It's just like the NBA or the NFL. You can't say there's one player because that's how good the game is, and that's how much it's evolved over the years,\" said Kelly Krauskopf, president and general manager of the Indiana Fever. \"That's the way it should be.\"\n\nThe 18-year-old WNBA will showcase its best in Saturday's All-Star Game at Phoenix. Fever forward Tamika Catchings was elected a starter for the Eastern Conference, as she has in every year in which there has been the game.\n\nCatchings might not come to mind as the best ever, but she is a \"stat-stuffer\" along the lines of LeBron James, as Krauskopf put it. While in high school, Catchings had the only verified quintuple-double in basketball history: 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals, 10 blocks in a 1997 game.\n\n\"Absolutely, she's one of the best players to ever play the game,\" Krauskopf said. \"She does every single thing.\"\n\nMoreover, Catchings has won championships at every level: high school, college, WNBA and Olympics.\n\nFollowing is a list of 10 players, including a case for and against each as being the best ever. Five are in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame: Carol Blazejowski, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Meyers, Cheryl Miller and Lynette Woodard.\n\nThree players early in their careers weren't considered for the top 10 but could end up becoming No. 1: Breanna Stewart, 19, University of Connecticut; Maya Moore, 25, Minnesota Lynx, and Candace Parker, 28, Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nAlthough no formal poll was conducted, the list was assembled with the help of Krauskopf, TV analyst Debbie Antonelli and ESPN.com columnist Mechelle Voepel.\n\nCarol Blazejowski\n\nBorn: Sept. 29, 1956, Elizabeth, N.J. (age 57).\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: Montclair State, 1974-78.\n\nInternational medals: World Championships (gold, 1979); Pan American Games (silver, 1979); World University Games (gold, 1979 and '77).\n\nCareer recap: \"Blaze\" embodied \"Showtime\" a few years before Magic Johnson. On March 6, 1978, she set a Madison Square Garden record by scoring 52 points in Montclair State's 102-91 victory over Queens College (before there was a 3-point line). She averaged 38.6 ppg that season and was college Player of the Year, leading Montclair State to the AIAW Final Four.\n\nOn the international stage, she led Team USA to a world championship in 1979, ending a 22-year drought. She averaged 18.7 ppg in the tournament. The U.S. boycott deprived Blazejowski of an Olympic stage in 1980. In the 1980-81 season of the Women's Basketball League, she was MVP and the league's top scorer (29.6 ppg) for the New Jersey Gems.\n\n\"Blaze would be a modern-day (Diana) Taurasi, in terms of being able to shoot from anywhere on the floor,\" Krauskopf said.\n\nCase for: There hasn't been a scorer like her since she retired.\n\nCase against: Quality of opposition was poor, by 21st-century standards.\n\nTamika Catchings\n\nBorn: July 21, 1979, Stratford, N.J. (age 34).\n\nWNBA team: Indiana Fever.\n\nCollege: Tennessee, 1997-2001.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2012, '08, '04); World Championships (gold, 2010, '02; bronze, '06).\n\nCareer recap: Catchings is the only player in WNBA history to rank in the all-time top 10 in points (fourth), rebounds (fourth), assists (eighth) and steals (first). She is 11th in blocked shots. She is the only player ever to finish a season in the top 10 of all five categories, and she has done so twice.\n\nShe was the WNBA's Most Valuable Player in 2011 and led the Fever to their only league championship in 2012.\n\nCase for: No one else has ever been as productive in so many ways over so many years.\n\nCase against: As great as she has been, she has been MVP only once.\n\nCynthia Cooper\n\nBorn: April 14, 1963, Chicago (age 51).\n\nWNBA team: Houston Comets.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1982-86.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 1988; bronze, '92); World Championships (gold, 1990, '86); Pan American Games (gold, 1987); Goodwill Games (gold, 1986).\n\nCareer recap: Cooper was 34 when the WNBA debuted in 1997, and she proceeded to lead the Comets to the first four league titles and was MVP of all four WNBA Finals. She was MVP in 1997 and '98.\n\nIn one overseas season, she led the Spanish league in scoring (36.7 ppg). She played nearly 10 years in Italy and was that league's top scorer eight times.\n\nBefore that, Cooper helped USC to NCAA championships in 1983 and '84.\n\nCase for: She dominated early years of WNBA after becoming a star in Europe.\n\nCase against: She was overshadowed at USC by Cheryl Miller.\n\nLauren Jackson\n\nBorn: May 11, 1981, Albury, Australia (age 33).\n\nWNBA team: Seattle Storm.\n\nCollege: None.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (2012, bronze; '08, '04, 2000, silver); World Championships (2006, gold; '02, bronze).\n\nCareer recap: The 6-5 Australian is almost certainly the most well-rounded post player of all time. She is as adept from the 3-point line as she is near the basket.\n\nJackson has been MVP of the WNBA three times (2003, '07, '10) and led Seattle to league championships in 2004 and '10. She is fourth in league history in points per game (18.9).\n\nCase for: Her inside/outside versatility redefined what it meant to be a female post player.\n\nCase against: Injuries have limited her. She has played 22 games over the past four WNBA seasons.\n\nLisa Leslie\n\nBorn: July 7, 1972, Gardena, Calif. (age 42).\n\nWNBA team: Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1990-94.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2008, '04, '00, 1996); World Championships (gold, 2002, 1998); World University Games (gold, 1991).\n\nCareer recap: The 6-5 Leslie was able to dunk a basketball by her sophomore year of high school and once scored 101 points in game. At USC, she was college Player of the Year in '94.\n\nBesides her four Olympic gold medals, she led the Sparks to WNBA championships in 2001 and '02. She was MVP three times (2001, '04, '06) and is the league's all-time leader in rebounds. She was a first-team all-league selection a record eight times.\n\nCase for: At her peak, she was the sport's most dominant player.\n\nCase against: She's not the all-around player that others are.\n\nAnn Meyers\n\nBorn: March 26, 1955, San Diego (age 59)\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: UCLA, 1975-79.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (silver, 1976); World Championship (gold, 1979); Pan American Games (gold, 1975; silver, '79); World University Games (silver, 1977).\n\nCareer recap: In 1979, she made NBA history by signing a $50,000 contract with the Indiana Pacers. Her tryout lasted three days, but it would be wrong to make that her landmark achievement.\n\nShe was the first high school player to make a national team, first woman to receive a UCLA basketball scholarship, first four-time All-American and first NCAA Division I player to record a quadruple-double. She was the 1978 college Player of the Year, leading UCLA to an AIAW national championship. She also played in the Women's Professional Basketball League (WPBL) and was co-MVP in 1979-80.\n\nCase for: In her era, she was usually considered No. 1.\n\nCase against: Her career was short and competition inferior.\n\nCheryl Miller\n\nBorn: Jan. 3, 1964, Riverside, Calif. (age 50)\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1982-86.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 1984); World Championships (gold, 1986; silver, 1983); Goodwill Games (gold, 1986); Pan American Games (gold, 1983).\n\nCareer recap: The sister of the Pacers' Reggie Miller was labeled by Sports Illustrated as the best player in college basketball, male or female. She was a four-time All-American in both high school — she once scored 105 points in a game — and college. Her teams went 132-4 in high school and 112-20 in college. Miller helped USC to NCAA championships in 1983 and '84. She was a three-time college Player of the Year and had a career scoring average of 23.6.\n\nKnee injuries prevented her from continuing a playing career in the late 1980s, and she became a TV broadcaster and coach.\n\nCase for: She was the premier player of her era.\n\nCase against: Her career was so short that if a grade were awarded, it would be \"Incomplete.\"\n\nSheryl Swoopes\n\nBorn: March 25, 1971, Brownfield, Texas (age 41).\n\nWNBA teams: Houston Comets, Seattle Storm, Tulsa Shock.\n\nCollege: Texas Tech, 1991-93.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2004, '00, 1996); World Championships (gold, 2002, 1998; bronze, 2004, 1996); Goodwill Games (gold, 1994).\n\nCareer recap: Swoopes is sometimes referred to as the closest to Michael Jordan that the women's game has produced. She was the first female player to have a Nike shoe named after her: \"Air Swoopes.\"\n\nShe was Jordan-esque in her final college game, scoring 47 points to lead Texas Tech over Ohio State in the 1993 NCAA championship game — a record for men or women in the title game. She averaged 35.4 ppg in the tournament and was college Player of the Year.\n\nSwoopes became the WNBA's first three-time MVP (2000, '02, '05) and first three-time Defensive Player of the Year. She won four league titles as a member of the Comets.\n\nCase for: She has every important individual and team achievement in college, pro and international play.\n\nCase against: She wasn't the best player on Comets' championship teams. (That was Cooper.)\n\nDiana Taurasi\n\nBorn: June 11, 1982, Glendale, Calif.\n\nWNBA team: Phoenix Mercury.\n\nCollege: Connecticut\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2012, '08, '04); World Championship (gold, 2010; bronze, '06).\n\nCareer recap: Taurasi, daughter of an Italian father and Argentinian mother, is on track to become the WNBA's all-time leading scorer by the end of 2015 or early in '16. She is having one of her best seasons in 2014 and could add a second MVP award to the one she won in '09.\n\nTaurasi led UConn to three NCAA championships and a four-year record of 139-8. She was twice the college Player of the Year.\n\nShe led the Mercury to WNBA titles in 2009 (over the Fever) and '07. Taurasi has won a record five league scoring titles and equaled Leslie's record of eight first-team all-league designations. She is third in league history in 3-pointers and sixth in assists.\n\nIf she should pick any player in women's basketball history to build a franchise around, Voepel said in an e-mail, \"it may very well be Taurasi.\"\n\nCase for: Besides being a scorer, she has been a winner.\n\nCase against: Her scoring benefited from Mercury's up-tempo system.\n\nLynette Woodard\n\nBorn: Aug. 12, 1959, Wichita, Kan. (age 54).\n\nWNBA team: Cleveland Rockers.\n\nCollege: Kansas.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 1984); World Championships (gold, 1990; silver, '83); Pan American Games (gold, 1983; bronze, '91); World University Games (gold, 1979).\n\nCareer recap: Woodard is one of the most athletic players in history but suffered from lack of exposure. She was a pro in Italy and came out of retirement at age 37 to play two WNBA seasons.\n\nShe was a four-time All-American and is the all-time college leader with 3,649 points. Woodard was captain of the gold-medal-winning Olympic team in 1984 and averaged 10.5 points in six games. In 1985, she became the first female member of the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nCase for: She represented a glimpse of what the women's game would become.\n\nCase against: Her elite career was also short, and she wasn't necessarily the top player on national teams.\n\nThey've got 'next'\n\nThree players early in their careers could end up being considered the best ever:\n\n• Breanna Stewart, 19, U. of Connecticut\n\n• Maya Moore, 25, Minnesota Lynx\n\n• Candace Parker, 28, Los Angeles Sparks\n\nCall Star reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.\n\nPreview box\n\nCHICAGO SKY (8-13) at INDIANA FEVER (10-12)\n\nTipoff: 7 p.m. Thursday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nTV: Fox Sports Indiana.\n\nRadio: WFNY-1070 AM\n\nNoteworthy: It's matchup of two reeling teams.

Porter Jr., five days shy of his 21st birthday, poured in 50 points and handed out 11 assists, making him the youngest NBA player to achieve a 50-point double-double with assists. It was the most points the Bucks had allowed that season.\n\nThe youngest player to secure a 50-point game at all? That would be former Bucks guard Brandon Jennings, who famously dropped 55 points at age 20 and 52 days in 2009 during the first days of his rookie year. LeBron James had twice achieved the feat younger than Porter, as had Suns star Devin Booker, who went on to face the Bucks in the NBA finals that season.\n\nPorter, originally drafted by the Bucks in 2019 though traded in a draft-day swap to Cleveland, averaged 16.6 points per game that season for the Rockets. It was one of three seasons in Houston, the last of which was in 2022-23 when he averaged 19.2 points per game. His previous best point total that season had been 27, with a career-best 30. Porter, who went 9 of 15 from three-point range, achieved his previous season best on 3-point shots alone.\n\nThe Rockets went on to lose eight of their final nine games that season. The Bucks, meanwhile, won eight of the next 10, followed by a first-round series sweep against Miami and playoff-series victories against Brooklyn, Atlanta and Phoenix for their first NBA championship in 50 years.\n\nBucks fans were for more concerned with Giannis Antetokounmpo's injury in same game\n\nThough the loss was head-scratching for the Bucks, a team still jockeying for positioning in the forthcoming Eastern Conference playoffs, there were bigger fish to fry. Giannis Antetokounmpo had left the game with an ankle injury just 32 seconds into the game, a horrifying development that served as a bad omen for the playoff injury that Antetokounmpo would incur later in the playoffs (though he already had experienced some knee soreness in March).\n\nAntetokounmpo, however, would miss only the next game the following night in a win against Chicago and returned to the floor against Brooklyn on May 2, when he nearly matched Porter with a 49-point performance for his own season high.\n\nPorter's off-the-court issues derailed a promising start to career\n\nPorter, who very likely would have remained in Houston were it not for his off-the-court issues, was already embroiled in some hot water. He'd been fined $50,000 by the NBA a day earlier for violating COVID-19 health and safety protocols, visiting a Miami club on April 19 in a move that had also cost him three games. Porter returned to action two days before the Bucks game in a loss to Minneapolis, scoring 10 points.\n\nPorter's past has been well documented. He was recently cleared of charges stemming from a 2023 assault case after satisfying the stipulations of his plea agreement.\n\nThe Rockets, who had signed Porter to a four-year extension in October 2022, traded him a year later to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the domestic violence charge. Porter was waived by the Thunder and was out of the league thereafter, playing in Greece and seeing no NBA action in 2023-24. His teammates overseas recalled a player who made a positive impression and didn't align with his dubious track record.\n\nKevin Porter will be back wearing the other jersey Tuesday night\n\nToday, Porter Jr. will be on the other side of the matchup in Houston playing for the Bucks, and he's made quite the impression by scoring close to 10 points per game in less than 17 minutes per contest through his first five games with the Bucks. Milwaukee, which explored adding Porter in the offseason, traded MarJon Beauchamp away to acquire Porter Jr. at the deadline from the Clippers.\n\nBeauchamp, for what it's worth, has played only sparingly since the deal, seeing less than 6 minutes a game over three contests with the Clippers. He's scoring 4.0 points per game.\n\nPlayers to score 50-plus points against the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nAccording to data from Stathead and Basketball-Reference, a player has scored 50 points or more against the Bucks on 17 occasions, led by Karl Malone's 61-point game.\n\nLaMelo Ball, Charlotte (Nov. 23, 2024), 50 points*\n\nJimmy Butler, Miami (April 24, 2023), 56 points\n\nKevin Porter Jr., Houston (April 29, 2021), 50 points\n\nBradley Beal, Washington (Feb. 24, 2020), 55 points*\n\nDeMar DeRozan, Toronto (Jan. 1, 2018), 52 points\n\nLeBron James, Cleveland (Feb. 20, 2009), 55 points\n\nLeBron James, Cleveland (Dec. 10, 2005), 52 points*\n\nJermaine O'Neal, Indiana (Jan. 4, 2005), 55 points\n\nAllen Iverson, Philadelphia (Dec. 18, 2004), 54 points\n\nAllan Houston, New York (March 16, 2003), 50 points\n\nMichael Adams, Denver (March 23, 1991), 54 points*\n\nKarl Malone, Utah (Jan. 27, 1990), 61 points\n\nDale Ellis, Seattle (Nov. 9, 1989), 53 points*\n\nMichael Jordan, Chicago (Feb. 16, 1989), 50 points\n\nMichael Jordan, Chicago (April 13, 1987), 50 points\n\nGeorge Gervin, San Antonio (March 6, 1982), 50 points\n\nBilly Cunningham, Philadelphia (April 1, 1970), 50 points*\n\n*indicates Bucks victory", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2024/12/29/lebron-james-40-years-old-nba-players/77294277007/", "title": "LeBron James turns 40.

M.J. or Kareem? Wilt or Russell? What about LeBron?\n\nWhat about the female players?\n\nThat might be a more difficult conversation. Not because there aren't candidates, but because it's a list that can't easily be pared.\n\n\"It's just like the NBA or the NFL. You can't say there's one player because that's how good the game is, and that's how much it's evolved over the years,\" said Kelly Krauskopf, president and general manager of the Indiana Fever. \"That's the way it should be.\"\n\nThe 18-year-old WNBA will showcase its best in Saturday's All-Star Game at Phoenix. Fever forward Tamika Catchings was elected a starter for the Eastern Conference, as she has in every year in which there has been the game.\n\nCatchings might not come to mind as the best ever, but she is a \"stat-stuffer\" along the lines of LeBron James, as Krauskopf put it. While in high school, Catchings had the only verified quintuple-double in basketball history: 25 points, 18 rebounds, 11 assists, 10 steals, 10 blocks in a 1997 game.\n\n\"Absolutely, she's one of the best players to ever play the game,\" Krauskopf said. \"She does every single thing.\"\n\nMoreover, Catchings has won championships at every level: high school, college, WNBA and Olympics.\n\nFollowing is a list of 10 players, including a case for and against each as being the best ever. Five are in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame: Carol Blazejowski, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Meyers, Cheryl Miller and Lynette Woodard.\n\nThree players early in their careers weren't considered for the top 10 but could end up becoming No. 1: Breanna Stewart, 19, University of Connecticut; Maya Moore, 25, Minnesota Lynx, and Candace Parker, 28, Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nAlthough no formal poll was conducted, the list was assembled with the help of Krauskopf, TV analyst Debbie Antonelli and ESPN.com columnist Mechelle Voepel.\n\nCarol Blazejowski\n\nBorn: Sept. 29, 1956, Elizabeth, N.J. (age 57).\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: Montclair State, 1974-78.\n\nInternational medals: World Championships (gold, 1979); Pan American Games (silver, 1979); World University Games (gold, 1979 and 1977).\n\nCareer recap: \"Blaze\" embodied \"Showtime\" a few years before Magic Johnson. On March 6, 1978, she set a Madison Square Garden record by scoring 52 points in Montclair State's 102-91 victory over Queens College (before there was a 3-point line). She averaged 38.6 points a game that season and was college Player of the Year, leading Montclair State to the AIAW Final Four.\n\nOn the international stage, she led Team USA to a world championship in 1979, ending a 22-year drought. She averaged 18.7 points a game in the tournament. The U.S. boycott deprived Blazejowski of an Olympic stage in 1980. In the 1980-81 season of the Women's Basketball League, she was MVP and the league's top scorer (29.6 ppg) for the New Jersey Gems.\n\n\"Blaze would be a modern-day (Diana) Taurasi, in terms of being able to shoot from anywhere on the floor,\" Krauskopf said.\n\nCase for: There hasn't been a scorer like her since she retired.\n\nCase against: Quality of opposition was poor, by 21st-century standards.\n\nTamika Catchings\n\nBorn: July 21, 1979, Stratford, N.J. (age 34).\n\nWNBA team: Indiana Fever.\n\nCollege: Tennessee, 1997-2001.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2012, 2008, 2004); World Championships (gold, 2010, 2002; bronze, 2006).\n\nCareer recap: Catchings is the only player in WNBA history to rank in the all-time top 10 in points (fourth), rebounds (fourth), assists (eighth) and steals (first). She is 11th in blocked shots. She is the only player ever to finish a season in the top 10 of all five categories, and she has done so twice.\n\nShe was the WNBA's Most Valuable Player in 2011 and led the Fever to their only league championship in 2012.\n\nCase for: No one else has ever been as productive in so many ways over so many years.\n\nCase against: As great as she has been, she has been MVP only once.\n\nCynthia Cooper\n\nBorn: April 14, 1963, Chicago (age 51).\n\nWNBA team: Houston Comets.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1982-86.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 1988; bronze, 1992); World Championships (gold, 1990, 1986); Pan American Games (gold, 1987); Goodwill Games (gold, 1986).\n\nCareer recap: Cooper was 34 when the WNBA debuted in 1997, and she proceeded to lead the Comets to the first four league titles and was MVP of all four WNBA Finals. She was MVP in 1997 and 1998.\n\nIn one overseas season, she led the Spanish league in scoring (36.7 ppg). She played nearly 10 years in Italy and was that league's top scorer eight times.\n\nBefore that, Cooper helped USC to NCAA championships in 1983 and 1984.\n\nCase for: She dominated early years of the WNBA after becoming a star in Europe.\n\nCase against: She was overshadowed at USC by Cheryl Miller.\n\nLauren Jackson\n\nBorn: May 11, 1981, Albury, Australia (age 33).\n\nWNBA team: Seattle Storm.\n\nCollege: None.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (bronze, 2012; silver, 2008, 2004, 2000, ); World Championships (gold, 2006, bronze, 2002).\n\nCareer recap: The 6-5 Australian is almost certainly the most well-rounded post player of all time. She is as adept from the 3-point line as she is near the basket.\n\nJackson has been MVP of the WNBA three times (2003, 2007, '200) and led Seattle to league championships in 2004 and 2010. She is fourth in league history in points per game (18.9).\n\nCase for: Her inside/outside versatility redefined what it meant to be a female post player.\n\nCase against: Injuries have limited her. She has played 22 games over the past four WNBA seasons.\n\nLisa Leslie\n\nBorn: July 7, 1972, Gardena, Calif. (age 42).\n\nWNBA team: Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1990-94.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2008, 2004, 2000, 1996); World Championships (gold, 2002, 1998); World University Games (gold, 1991).\n\nCareer recap: The 6-5 Leslie was able to dunk a basketball by her sophomore year of high school and once scored 101 points in game. At USC, she was college Player of the Year in 1994.\n\nBesides her four Olympic gold medals, she led the Sparks to WNBA championships in 2001 and 2002. She was MVP three times (2001, 2004, 2006) and is the league's all-time leader in rebounds. She was a first-team all-league selection a record eight times.\n\nCase for: At her peak, she was the sport's most dominant player.\n\nCase against: She's not the all-around player that others are.\n\nAnn Meyers\n\nBorn: March 26, 1955, San Diego (age 59)\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: UCLA, 1975-79.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (silver, 1976); World Championship (gold, 1979); Pan American Games (gold, 1975; silver, 1979); World University Games (silver, 1977).\n\nCareer recap: In 1979, she made NBA history by signing a $50,000 contract with the Indiana Pacers. Her tryout lasted three days, but it would be wrong to make that her landmark achievement.\n\nShe was the first high school player to make a national team, first woman to receive a UCLA basketball scholarship, first four-time All-American and first NCAA Division I player to record a quadruple-double. She was the 1978 college Player of the Year, leading UCLA to an AIAW national championship. She also played in the Women's Professional Basketball League (WPBL) and was co-MVP in 1979-80.\n\nCase for: In her era, she was usually considered No. 1.\n\nCase against: Her career was short and the competition inferior.\n\nCheryl Miller\n\nBorn: Jan. 3, 1964, Riverside, Calif. (age 50)\n\nWNBA team: None.\n\nCollege: Southern California, 1982-86.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 1984); World Championships (gold, 1986; silver, 1983); Goodwill Games (gold, 1986); Pan American Games (gold, 1983).\n\nCareer recap: The sister of the NBA great Reggie Miller was labeled by Sports Illustrated as the best player in college basketball, male or female. She was a four-time All-American in both high school — she once scored 105 points in a game — and college. Her teams went 132-4 in high school and 112-20 in college. Miller helped USC to NCAA championships in 1983 and 1984. She was a three-time college Player of the Year and had a career scoring average of 23.6.\n\nKnee injuries prevented her from continuing a playing career in the late 1980s, and she became a TV broadcaster and coach.\n\nCase for: She was the premier player of her era.\n\nCase against: Her career was so short that if a grade were awarded, it would be \"Incomplete.\"\n\nSheryl Swoopes\n\nBorn: March 25, 1971, Brownfield, Texas (age 41).\n\nWNBA teams: Houston Comets, Seattle Storm, Tulsa Shock.\n\nCollege: Texas Tech, 1991-93.\n\nInternational medals: Olympics (gold, 2004, 2000, 1996); World Championships (gold, 2002, 1998; bronze, 2004, 1996); Goodwill Games (gold, 1994).\n\nCareer recap: Swoopes is sometimes referred to as the closest to Michael Jordan that the women's game has produced. She was the first female player to have a Nike shoe named after her: \"Air Swoopes.\"\n\nShe was Jordan-esque in her final college game, scoring 47 points to lead Texas Tech over Ohio State in the 1993 NCAA championship game — a record for men or women in the title game.

She won four league titles as a member of the Comets.\n\nCase for: She has every important individual and team achievement in college, pro and international play.\n\nCase against: She wasn't the best player on Comets' championship teams.

She is having one of her best seasons in 2014 and could add a second MVP award to the one she won in 2009.\n\nTaurasi led UConn to three NCAA championships and a four-year record of 139-8. She was twice the college Player of the Year.\n\nShe led the Mercury to WNBA titles in 2007 and 2009. Taurasi has won a record five league scoring titles and equaled Leslie's record of eight first-team all-league designations.

Woodard was captain of the gold medal-winning Olympic team in 1984 and averaged 10.5 points in six games.

He pipped Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo to the award.\n\nJokic is the 15th player to win the MVP multiple times and the second straight to win back-to-back awards after Antetokounmpo in 2018-19 and 2019-20.\n\nJokic accepted the award while at his horse stable in Serbia.\n\nWhen asked by TNT’s Ernie Johnson after winning the award if he ever considered himself a longshot, Jokic agreed, adding, “There is no way I’d come to NBA and play basketball from this city, from this stable, basically, and now I’m playing basketball in the best league in the world and playing at a high level.”\n\nJokic was at his horse stable in Serbia while accepting his MVP award 💀 pic.twitter.com/VXOnphYeYZ — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) May 11, 2022\n\nAs a young boy, Jokic said he “was not thinking about playing basketball, not even going to lie.”\n\n“I was here in the stable,” he said. “I was cleaning the boxes. I was cleaning the horses. At that age, I was not thinking about basketball at all.”\n\nJokic improved on his overall game from last year’s MVP-winning season, averaging 27.1 points, 13.8 rebounds and 7.9 assists in 74 regular-season games this year. Last year, he averaged 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game.\n\nDuring the regular season, Jokic became the first player in NBA history with 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 500 assists in a single season.\n\nHe also racked up a league-leading 19 triple-doubles in the regular season, meaning he has 76 in his career, which trails only Wilt Chamberlain (78) among centers.\n\n“To watch Nikola develop into one of the few back-to-back MVPs this league has ever seen has been truly incredible,” said Denver Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly. “It’s indicative of who Nikola is as a person and a basketball player – hard working, extremely motivated and dedicated to bettering himself and all of his teammates any way he can.”\n\nJokic being defended by the Golden State Warriors' Draymond Green. Jed Jacobsohn/AP\n\nNuggets battled Warriors in playoffs\n\nJokic’s Nuggets were extremely shorthanded this season. Point guard Jamal Murray missed the entire year due to a torn ACL while Michael Porter Jr. played just nine games because of a back injury.\n\nYet despite all the adversity in his way, Jokic was able to drag Denver to the playoffs, finishing as the Western Conference’s sixth seed.\n\nThat earned the Nuggets a clash with the Golden State Warriors where they would eventually lose in five games in their best-of-seven game series.\n\nIn the series, Jokic averaged 31.0 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.6 steals and one block per game on 57.5% shooting from the field, almost singlehandedly keeping the Nuggets in most of the games.\n\nThe five games included some fierce battles with Warriors forward Draymond Green – widely considered one of the best defensive players in the NBA.\n\nAfter the Warriors had clinched the series winning victory in Game 5, Jokic and Green shared an embrace at half-court and exchanged some words which Green explained in his postgame press conference.\n\n“I told him thank you for making me better. It’s an honor and a pleasure to play someone so skilled. Usually when you have guys that talented and skilled, they’re soft. And he’s far, far from soft. He’s an absolutely incredible player,” Green said.", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/03/03/nba-70-70-facts-february-throughout-league-history/80513206/", "title": "NBA 70 for 70: Facts from February throughout league history", "text": "AJ Neuharth-Keusch\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAs the NBA celebrates its 70th anniversary, we go back in time to look at some facts from February throughout the history of the league, as well as some that have taken place during the 2015-16 season.\n\nThe facts are broken down into five categories: single-game performances, statistical milestones, All-Star history, miscellaneous facts, and birthdays.\n\n(Facts from 2015-16 season in italics)\n\nSingle-game performances\n\n1.

Months prior, the alliance of the three nations – dubbed the \"United Bid\" –published dazzling figures: $5 billion in short-term economic activity for the continent, 40,000 jobs, new tourists — backed by a study from The Boston Consulting Group.\n\nSound good? Well, not so fast, said Dennis Coates, an economist and professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\n“We’re not going to be any richer or any healthier as a country,” Coates said. “We’re throwing a party.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThough the World Cup does bring in various forms of economic activity for host nations, that growth is marginal for a multitrillion-dollar economy such as the U.S., he said.\n\nA win for tourism?\n\nOn the surface, the World Cup looks like a boon for the tourism industry of any host nation. For example, Brazil – which hosted the event in 2014 – welcomed more than 1 million foreigners to watch soccer, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism.\n\nYet air travel trends suggest the World Cup hurts travelers’ desires to visit a host country during the time of the event. The Brazilian Airline Association reported that Brazil experienced a decrease in air traffic of 11 to 15 percent in June 2014 compared to June 2013, according to The Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management.\n\nMany travelers who would otherwise visit a country won’t want to during the World Cup due to congestion and heightened prices, according to Andrew Zimbalist, an economist and professor at Smith College.\n\n“In the dynamic sense, it doesn’t help tourism at all,\" Zimbalist said. “It hurts tourism when you displace normal tourists with soccer tourists.”\n\nBig infrastructure costs\n\nConstruction of stadiums is one of the largest costs incurred by World Cup host nations. For the 2010 World Cup, South Africa had to spend roughly $1.5 billion to renovate five stadiums and construct five new ones. Brazil nearly doubled that amount in 2014. And for this year’s World Cup, Russia spent $4.3 billion on stadiums.\n\nAdditionally, after the World Cup is over, some stadiums that had cost millions to construct remain unused, such as the Arena da Amazônia in Manaus, Brazil.\n\nThe United Bid isn't expected to face similar challenges. The bid proposed 23 cities – almost all of which have soccer stadiums – across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. FIFA –the group that serves as the governing body of international soccer – will select 16 from the list.\n\n“They already have great stadiums, so there’s no need to pay to build anything,” said Simon Kuper, co-author of “Soccernomics,” a book about the intersection of soccer and economics.\n\nState and local spending\n\nState and local governments end up bearing a lot of the cost of hosting the World Cup. First, they need to provide increased security. With large amounts of people concentrated into a small area, the likelihood of a terrorist attack increases. This proved to be the case in the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta, where domestic terrorist Eric Robert Rudolph set off a blast that killed one person and injured 111.\n\nTo combat potential terror threats, local governments within each host city will have to dish out a lot of cash on enhanced security measures to keep spectators safe. For example, in Brazil, stationing additional police forces and improving security technology cost the nation as a whole more than $1 billion.\n\nWorld Cup host nations also must focus on the maintenance of their cities where matches are held. With public funds, municipalities typically fix potential eyesores such as potholes and step up services such as trash collection.\n\nThis beautification of certain places – roads near the airport, hotels and stadiums – might be “misdirected public spending,\" Coates said. Instead, he argues that it would be more beneficial for the U.S. to focus on maintenance in places that need it most, such as industrial sectors.\n\nJob creation\n\nFrom construction to maintenance to staffers at games, any World Cup contains numerous tasks that require more workers. In the 2006 World Cup, host nation Germany created 50,000 new jobs to support the event.\n\nAccording to Zimbalist, though, these jobs may make it harder for governments to create more jobs in the future.\n\n“Most of the jobs will be built on debt, (which) has to be paid back,” he said. “Even if you are creating a few extra jobs today, in the future the city will have less money to issue debt to build other things.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY intern Ben Tobin on Twitter: @TobinBen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2018/04/30/president-trump-african-nations-back-2026-world-cup-bid/567432002/", "title": "Trump urges African nations to support 2026 World Cup bid", "text": "President Trump used a Rose Garden news conference Monday with Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari to push for a North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"I hope all African countries and countries throughout the world that we also will be supporting you, and that they will likewise support us in our bid along with Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup,\" Trump said.\n\nFIFA will decide between North America and Morocco to host the event when officials for soccer's governing body meet June 13 in Moscow.\n\n\"We will be watching very closely,\" Trump said, \"and any help they could give us in that bid we would appreciate.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's words could potentially be seen as a threat to countries that oppose the three-pronged North American bid of the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

It is expected that both semifinals and the final will all be held in U.S. venues.\n\nIndeed, Trump's behind-the-scenes actions may even have helped sway some key votes. The White House provided U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro with three separate letters that Cordeiro showed to delegates, containing guarantees from Trump that any immigration policies relating to predominantly Muslim countries would impose no restriction affecting the tournament.\n\nBoth bids were permitted 15 minutes to make a presentation to the FIFA members immediately before the vote. The United Bid featured a youth team player from each of the three nations, beginning with a moving tale by 17-year-old Canadian Alphonso Davies, the current Major League Soccer player of the week, about how his family had been welcomed after fleeing civil war in Africa.\n\nThe three federation chiefs also spoke, with Cordeiro strongly emphasizing the profitability of a North American tournament, promising $11 billion in revenues.\n\nMorocco's presentation took some not-so-subtle shots at the U.S., highlighting the fact that guns are banned in Morocco and stating that during the 1994 World Cup even world-renowned soccer stars were unknown in America.\n\nIt was a solid performance by Morocco, which entered bidding late and was always going to be up against the odds.
