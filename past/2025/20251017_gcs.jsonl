Media representatives had been invited to what was described as a briefing by the head of the AU mediation team, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria. “It was only when the event began, about three hours behind schedule, that it became clear a truce was about to be signed.”\n\nObasanjo warned that the signing of the deal was just the beginning of the peace process. “Implementation of the peace agreement signed today is critical for its success,” he said.\n\nThe UN Secretary General António Guterres described the agreement as “a welcome first step, which we hope can start to bring some solace to the millions of Ethiopian civilians that have really suffered during this conflict”.\n\nThe deal is certainly a major breakthrough, but it will “be received with some degree of caution”, said the BBC. This is not the first ceasefire that has been agreed during the conflict.

From the mid-1990s, the country started moving towards democracy, and from a state of dire poverty it became a model for rapid, effective development. In 2019, its prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, won the Nobel Peace Prize for ending Ethiopia’s 20-year war with neighbouring Eritrea. But the nation’s underlying ethnic tensions and its violent history have proved hard to escape.\n\nTop ten most dangerous countries - YouTube Watch On\n\nTigray, Ethiopia’s northernmost region, is home to seven million people out of Ethiopia’s 115 million population, and has often been a focal point for disputes. Tigrayans are the nation’s fourth largest ethnic group (the two largest, the Oromo and the Amhara, make up more than 60%). They have a strong local Orthodox Christian identity, and a strong sense of grievance against central government.\n\nHow have these tensions influenced events?\n\nIn 1974, Ethiopia’s last emperor, Haile Selassie, was deposed by a socialist junta. During the long period of military rule and civil war that followed, Tigray suffered terribly: it was the epicentre of the great famine of 1984. Over time, the separatist TPLF became the most powerful rebel group in the country, forming an alliance that in 1991 eventually toppled the communist dictatorship.\n\nIn the years after, Ethiopian politics were dominated by TPLF politicians such as Meles Zenawi, its prime minister from 1995 to 2012. Meles led Ethiopia towards prosperity and stability, but he was also repressive and perceived as favouring Tigrayans. This caused great resentment from Ethiopia’s 80 other ethnic groups.\n\nThe TPLF’s coalition was eventually forced out in 2018 by a wave of mass protests led by the current PM, Abiy, whose power base is in his own Oromo ethnic group. He formed the “pan-Ethiopian” Prosperity Party, and removed Tigrayans from key positions.\n\nWhy did this lead to the current conflict?\n\nThe TPLF, which remained in power in Tigray, saw Abiy’s centralising “pan-Ethiopian” politics as a threat to the country’s federal system and its delicate ethnic balance. Abiy, in turn, accused the Tigrayans of brazenly defying the authority of the central government – notably by holding elections in September 2020 despite a national postponement due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThings came to a head two months later, in early November 2020, when the TPLF’s militia launched an assault on an Ethiopian army base in Tigray, with the goal of seizing weapons. Hours later, Abiy launched a major military offensive into Tigray, and declared a six-month state of emergency in the region.\n\nThree years after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, forces under Abiy’s control were waging a brutal war against his own people. The US has accused his government of ethnic cleansing in Tigray and the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church has said the government was carrying out a genocide.\n\nAbiy won last year’s delayed elections with an overwhelming majority, securing 410 out of the total 436 seats and a further five years in office. Votes were not cast in Tigray. The win would “do little to improve Abiy’s reputation in the eyes of the international community”, said BBC Africa correspondent Vivienne Nunis.\n\nHow has the conflict played out?\n\n“Despite the scale of the crisis, comprehensive reporting on the conflict” was made “nearly impossible” due to a media blackout, said Deutsche Welle in January. But it seems that both sides overestimated their own strength – and that has resulted in a gruesome and protracted conflict.\n\nCivilians have been “caught” between the two sides, and “now face a calamity that is being likened to horrors of Africa’s – and Ethiopia’s — past: mass starvation and ethnocide”, said Bloomberg in March.\n\nThere is clear evidence of atrocities by both sides; Ethiopian and Eritrean troops have been accused of using rape as a weapon of war. “Rape is starting at the age of eight and to the age of 72,” an Ethiopian nun told The Guardian last year. “It is so widespread, I go on seeing it everywhere… This rape is in public, in front of family, husbands, in front of everyone.”\n\nMore than 2.6 million people have been displaced within Tigray and more than 60,000 had fled to neighbouring Sudan by March 2022, according to the UN’s Refugee Agency.\n\nWill the ceasefire hold?\n\nThe deal, signed on the eve of the second anniversary of the conflict beginning, “laid out a number of key objectives”, said CNN. These included “the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country”.\n\nBut those involved in the deal are acutely aware that it is just “the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace”. Mediators are concerned that “forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact”.\n\nExactly how the deal will be implemented is also “unclear”, continued CNN, “with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers”.\n\n“Key sticking points remain,” agreed NPR, which said the biggest threat to a lasting peace is “the presence of Eritrean troops in Tigray”. Despite being “heavily involved in the fighting”, Eritrea “was not represented at the talks and is not party to the deal”, said the broadcaster.\n\nEritrea’s president, Isaias Afwerki, “holds a long-standing grudge” against the leadership of the TPFL and he “may prove reluctant to withdraw from Tigray”, with the deal failing to contain any “direct provisions for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops”.\n\nWestern Tigray also remains a key issue. The region was occupied by forces from the neighbouring region of Amhara in the early days of the war. While Amhara politicians “insist the land is rightfully theirs”, Tigrayan leaders have “demanded its return”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/11/27/israel-hezbollah-cease-fire/76612673007/", "title": "An Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire: here's what we know", "text": "A cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah brokered by the U.S. and France took effect in Lebanon early Wednesday, raising hopes of ending more than a year of cross-border strikes and a full-scale war that has killed thousands.\n\nThe cease-fire began at 4 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) after it was approved by Israel’s security cabinet and then announced by President Joe Biden. It appeared to be holding in the immediate hours after coming into effect.\n\nWars in the Middle East: Israel approves ceasefire with Hezbollah\n\nThe war between Israel and Hezbollah was sparked by the war in Gaza, where Israel launched a military offensive to root out Hezbollah's ally Hamas − both of whom are supported by Iran − after the latter attacked Israel on Oct. 7 last year. Here's what we know about the Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire deal and the implications for the Middle East region.\n\nWhat are the terms of the cease-fire?\n\nIt's intended to be permanent. However, the deal stipulates a 60-day pause in hostilities to allow Hezbollah's Lebanon-based fighters to retreat from the so-called Blue Line, an unofficial Israel-Lebanon border area that runs parallel to the Litani River. Over the next two months, Israel will gradually withdraw its forces from Lebanon.\n\nWho will monitor the agreement's implementation?\n\nThe U.S. and France, though the deal largely mirrors an existing United Nations Security Council resolution − 1701 − which ended a war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Under 1701, only Lebanon's government and U.N. peacekeeping personnel, known as UNIFIL, are permitted to keep forces and weapons south of the Litani River.\n\nU.S. and French diplomats and mediators will work with Lebanon's army and UNIFIL to deter potential violations of the cease-fire but neither American nor French combat forces will be deployed to the area.\n\nWhat does the cease-fire mean for the war in Gaza?\n\nThe deal does not directly address the war in Gaza that erupted after Hamas attacked communities in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping dozens back to the Palestinian territory. Israel has killed more than 45,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nHezbollah previously insisted it would only halt its attacks on Israel if Israel agreed to stop fighting in Gaza. The cease-fire may nevertheless, if it holds, help push, some reports have suggested, Hamas toward seeking a truce. The White House has said it intends to begin a renewed push for a Gaza cease-fire in the coming days.\n\nWhat does the cease-fire mean for civilians?\n\nCivilians have borne the brunt of the conflict, with many killed or injured and an estimated million-plus people displaced from their homes in Lebanon and Israel. Lebanese media outlets reported that thousands of people were returning to their homes Wednesday in southern Lebanon despite warnings from Israel's military not to do so.\n\nIn Israel, some residents who over the last year fled northern communities amid Hezbollah shelling and missile attacks questioned whether the cease-fire would lead to a lasting peace.\n\n\"Despite the difficulties in my personal life, I’d rather we continued fighting and only agree to a ceasefire when we’re really in control,\" Miro Vahknin, from the coastal city of Nahariya, told the Times of Israel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/africa/tigray-accept-au-ceasefire-intl", "title": "Tigrayan forces say they're ready to accept an AU-led peace ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nForces in Ethiopia’s Tigray region said they are ready to observe an immediate ceasefire and accept an African Union-led peace process to end a conflict with federal forces that has stretched over nearly two years.\n\n“We are ready to abide by an immediate and mutually agreed cessation of hostilities in order to create a conducive atmosphere,” the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) said in a statement.\n\nTigray’s negotiation team includes TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda, and General Tsadkan Gebretinsae, who are “ready to be deployed without delay,” the statement added.\n\nThe Ethiopian government formed a committee in June to negotiate with forces from the Tigray region.\n\nEthiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe African Union (AU) welcomed the TPLF’s announcement, calling it a “unique opportunity towards the restoration of peace” in Ethiopia, the AU chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement late Sunday.\n\nThe TPLF had previously expressed major concerns over the AU’s mediation and demanded the government restore major services such as banking and communication to Tigray before any talks can hold.

A year later, he launched a conflict that spiraled into a brutal civil war, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nIn November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised that the clash would be resolved quickly. Two years on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people and given rise to a wave of atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the use of starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nEthiopia was struggling with significant economic, ethnic and political challenges long before a feud between Abiy and the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), bubbled over into unrest and threatened to pull Africa’s second-most populous country apart.\n\nNow, after years of grinding conflict, the Ethiopian government and the leadership of the TPLF have agreed to cease hostilities and pull the country back from the brink. But the surprise truce leaves many questions unanswered, with few details on how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s happening in Ethiopia.\n\nHow did the conflict start?\n\nAn Ethiopian refugee prays at an Orthodox church near a refugee camp in Gedaref, eastern Sudan, on December 6, 2020. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Tigray conflict has its roots in tensions that go back generations in Ethiopia.\n\nThe country is made up of 10 regions – and two cities – that have a substantial amount of autonomy, including regional police and militia. Because of a previous conflict with neighboring Eritrea, there are also a large number of federal troops in Tigray. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines.\n\nBefore Abiy Ahmed came to power, the TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party’s authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign.\n\nIn 2018, Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to quell tensions and bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he became prime minister, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nIn his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party, Abiy sparked fears in some regions that the country’s federal system – which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states such as Tigray – was under threat. Leaders in Tigray withdrew to their mountainous heartland in the north, where they continued to control their own regional government.\n\nTensions boiled over in September 2020, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by going ahead with regional parliamentary elections that he had delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Abiy called the vote illegal and lawmakers cut funding to the TPLF leadership, setting off a tit-for-tat series of escalations between the regional and the federal government.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, after accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle and attempting to steal its weapons, Abiy ordered a military assault against the group, sending in national troops and fighters from the neighboring region of Amhara, along with soldiers from Eritrea. Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF leader, said in an op-ed in Foreign Policy that the group attacked the base in an “act of self-defense.” CNN cannot confirm the claims of either side.\n\nAbiy declared the offensive a success after just three weeks, but the conflict dragged on for two years, with both sides trading control over the regional capital Mekelle, gaining and losing ground.\n\nAn earlier humanitarian ceasefire broke down in August and fighting has intensified in the months since. The clashes, combined with a lack of fuel and the communications blackout, has severely curtailed aid distribution to the region.\n\nOn October 17, amid reports of heavy bombing in Shire and other Tigrayan cities, and food supplies running out in the regional capital Mekelle triggering fears of famine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the situation in the Tigray region was “spiraling out of control,” and that the violence had “reached alarming levels.”\n\nThe UN chief called for an “immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia,” and the urgent resumption of talks, which had been due to take place in September.\n\nA damaged tank on a road north of Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on February 26 EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat does the peace agreement actually mean?\n\nAfter just over a week of formal peace talks mediated by the African Union (AU) in South Africa’s administrative capital Pretoria, delegates from both sides of Ethiopia’s war agreed to a “permanent cessation of hostilities.” The surprise truce was signed by Getachew Reda from the TPLF and Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopia’s federal government, on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the war, on November 3.\n\nThe document laid out a number of key objectives, including the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country.\n\n“We have agreed to permanently silence the guns and end the two years of conflict in northern Ethiopia,” both sides said in a joint statement, published after delegates shook hands.\n\nThose involved in mediating the deal signaled that it was just the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace. Mediators have also warned that forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact. Still, the UN has called it a “critical first step” towards ending the conflict.\n\n“This is not the end of the peace process but the beginning of it,” said Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU’s high representative for the Horn of Africa and a former Nigerian president, who first announced the deal.\n\nAbiy, whose military, backed by Eritrean forces, has made rapid gains in Tigray over recent weeks, celebrated the conclusion of the talks, saying: “Our commitment to peace remains steadfast. And our commitment to collaborating for the implementation of the agreement is equally strong.”\n\nBut how the deal will be implemented is unclear, with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers.\n\n“These kinds of agreements should include constructive ambiguity, on the issues that are contested,” Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on Ethiopian politics at Bjorknes University College in Norway, told CNN. “But here it’s not constructive it’s more destructive, in that it will undermine the trust process and could possibly jeopardize the durability of the agreement.”\n\nRepresentatives from Ethiopia and the TPLF and mediators at a press conference announcing the agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere are a number of points in the agreement that Tronvoll said raise concerns, particularly one issue that was omitted entirely: the status of Eritrean forces in Tigray, which the text makes no mention of in spite of their outsized role in the conflict. Though the agreement states that the Ethiopian military will be deployed along the country’s borders, it does not specify whether they will ensure Eritrea’s withdrawal. “I don’t see any sustainable peace process if Eritrean forces are still on the ground,” Tronvoll said.\n\nThe deal is widely being seen as a capitulation by the TPLF, which, by Getachew’s own account, have suffered huge losses since hostilities resumed. “In order to address the pains of our people, we have made concessions because we have to build trust,” he said, adding that civilians and fighters were dying as he spoke.\n\nThe swift 30-day timeline for the overall disarmament and demobilization of Tigrayan fighters has raised eyebrows. And the agreement does not outline what force will replace them to provide security guarantees for Tigray’s civilian population, who have suffered widespread abuses at the hands of Ethiopian forces.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Ethiopian government will ensure “accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims,” but ultimately how that accountability might come about is opaque.\n\n“It’s one of the key issues left unanswered … how accountability will come about,” Tronvoll said. “Ultimately it is the generals and Abiy Ahmed himself who should be held to account. I don’t know if anyone believes he’ll sign off on an agreement in which he would be put on trial.”\n\nWhat atrocities have been committed in the conflict?\n\nFor months at the start of the conflict, Abiy denied that civilians were being harmed or that soldiers from Eritrea had joined the fight. But reports from international observers, human rights groups and CNN proved both of those claims wrong.\n\nThousands of people have died in the fighting, by many estimates, with reports of razed refugee camps, looting, sexual violence, massacres and extrajudicial killings. Many more have fled to Sudan, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees from Ethiopia seen in two decades. They describe a disastrous conflict that’s given rise to ethnic violence.\n\nEthiopia’s government has severely restricted access to journalists, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors’ accounts.\n\nBut evidence of atrocities began to leak out last year.\n\nTigrayans grieve by a mass grave in the city of Wukro, north of Mekele, on February 28, 2021. EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN investigations have uncovered evidence of massacres carried out in two Tigrayan towns, by Eritrean forces in Dengelat, and by Ethiopian soldiers in Mahibere Dego. A CNN team on the ground in central Tigray last April captured Eritrean troops – some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms – operating with total impunity, manning checkpoints and blocking vital humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after Abiy pledged to the international community that they would leave.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray.\n\nEritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities. Ethiopia’s government has pledged investigations into any wrongdoing.\n\nThe conflict, which erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades, plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity. The UN has repeatedly issued warnings about de facto humanitarian aid blockades, barring critical food and assistance to Tigray.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is blocking aid. But days after the UN’s aid chief warned Tigray was facing a “man-made” famine, Ethiopia ordered seven senior UN officials to be expelled from the country, including from organizations coordinating relief efforts.\n\nThere are currently about 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million in desperate need of healthcare, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn the same day that the truce was announced, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it had been two months since the last humanitarian aid reached the region, and that large numbers of displaced people were arriving in or moving toward Mekelle seeking assistance every day.\n\n“Since the beginning of the siege, food, medicine and other basic services have been weaponised,” Tedros said. “It has now been more than two months since the last humanitarian aid reached Tigray. But even before that, the aid reaching Tigray was a trickle – nowhere near enough to meet the needs.”\n\nHow did Abiy win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed campaigns in Jimma on June 16, 2021. Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than a year before Abiy launched an assault on his own people, he described war as “the epitome of hell” during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the honor for his role in ending a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for pushing significant reforms in Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was once a part of Ethiopia, but won independence in 1993 after a 30-year armed struggle. From 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war that killed thousands on both sides, which led to a long, dangerous stalemate and a total freeze in cooperation.\n\nOnce in power, Abiy moved quickly to normalize relations with Eritrea, in part by accepting the ruling of an international commission on boundaries between the two states.\n\nAbiy also made significant moves towards domestic reforms, raising hopes that he would bring about lasting change. As well as forging a truce with Eritrea, he lifted a severe security law, released thousands of political prisoners, moved to open up the telecommunications industry and expand private investment.\n\nBut his reputation as a leader who could unite Ethiopia has swiftly deteriorated, and his much-lauded peace deal with Eritrea appears to have paved the way for the two countries to go to war with their mutual foe – the TPLF.\n\nSince the conflict began, ethnically-driven violence has broken out into other parts of the country, including in Abiy’s home region, Oromia, the country’s most populous region. Last May, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group, vowed to wage “total war” against Abiy’s government.\n\nDespite promises to heal ethnic divides and pave the way for a peaceful, democratic transition, Abiy has increasingly invoked the playbook of repressive regimes: Shutting down internet and telephone services, arresting journalists and suppressing critics. Abiy has also been criticized for fueling “inflamed” rhetoric amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces he has described as “weeds” and “cancer.”\n\nLast July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray – a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised would be realized.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/28/south-sudan-white-army-militia/4231213/", "title": "South Sudan: 'White Army' militia marches to fight", "text": "AP\n\nJUBA, South Sudan (AP) — Twenty-five thousand young men who make up a tribal militia known as the \"White Army\" are marching toward a contested state capital in South Sudan, an official said Saturday, dimming hopes for a cease-fire.\n\nSeeking an end to the nearly two-week crisis in which an estimated 1,000 people have been killed, leaders from across East Africa announced on Friday that South Sudan had agreed to a \"cessation of hostilities\" against forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar, whom the government accuses of leading a coup attempt Dec. 15 that erupted into spiraling violence.\n\nBut Machar rejected that, saying in an interview with the BBC that any cease-fire had to be negotiated by delegations from both sides. The government in the capital, Juba, seized on that statement to further condemn Machar.\n\n\"Dr. Riek Machar has put obstacles to this genuine call by issuing pre-conditions that a cease-fire cannot be reached unless a negotiation is conducted,\" said Vice President James Wani Igga. \"This is complete intransigence and obstinacy because the main issue now is to stop violence.\"\n\nIn addition to those killed, tens of thousands are seeking shelters at United Nations camps. More fighting is expected.\n\nThere is a looming battle for Bor, the provincial capital of Jonglei state that briefly fell to rebels before government forces took it back this week, said military spokesman Col. Philip Aguer. Pro-Machar forces are believed to be preparing a fresh offensive to retake Bor, he said. Bor is the town where three United States military aircraft were hit by gunfire while trying to evacuate American citizens on Dec. 21, wounding four U.S. service members.\n\nAn estimated 25,000 youths from the Lou Nuer sub-clan — the same tribe Machar is from — are marching on Bor, said Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth. The \"White Army\" gets its name in part from the white ash fighters put on their skin as a form of protection from insects.\n\n\"He has decided to mobilize the youth in the name of his tribe,\" Lueth said.\n\nThe White Army has threatened the central government in recent past. In 2011 the army said that the Nuer youths would fight until all the Murle — another tribe — had been killed. The statement warned the national military to stay out of the way. Another statement warned that the White Army would \"wipe out\" the army, according to the Enough Project, a U.S.-based advocacy group that works on issues in central Africa.\n\nElsewhere, in oil-rich Unity state government troops were being forced to repel attacks by forces loyal to Machar, said Aguer. The military \"is fighting back, but it is the other side that is attacking us,\" he said.\n\nIGAD, the regional bloc of East African nations, demanded on Friday that negotiations begin before the end of the year between South Sudan's government and Machar, but there was no sign on Saturday that is likely.\n\n\"We are ready to meet even before that. It is now up to Machar to accept the ceasefire,\" said Vice President Igga.\n\nThe government blames Machar for plotting a coup attempt on Dec. 15. Machar denies that charge and his backers insist violence began when presidential guards from President Salva Kiir's majority Dinka tribe tried to disarm guards from Machar's Nuer ethnic group. From Juba the military clashes then spiraled across the country.\n\nThe United Nations, South Sudan's government and other analysts say the dispute is political at its heart, but has since taken on ethnic overtones. The fighting has displaced more than 120,000 people.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/23/iran-us-conflict-live-updates/84308966007/", "title": "Israel vows forceful response, says Iran violates Trump ceasefire", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Mideast conflict from Monday, June 23. For the latest news on the Iran-Israel conflict, read USA TODAY's live updates on the conflict for Tuesday, June 24.\n\nIsrael said that Iran had committed a ''severe violation\" of the Trump-announced ceasefire, and vowed to respond with force, only hours after Iran signaled it was willing to abide by the deal.Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel had detected Iranian missile launches and ordered \"high-intensity operations\" targeting Iran. Iranian media reported that the country has denied a ceasefire violation.\n\nEarlier, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked President Donald Trump and said it achieved its objective of \"eliminating the Iranian nuclear threat.\" Iranian officials said their government would halt attacks if Israel did.\n\nTrump had first announced the deal in a social media post and urged both countries not to violated it. He said that Israel and Iran agreed to a \"total ceasefire\" after the Iranian military retaliated for U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.\n\nA senior White House official told USA TODAY that Trump communicated directly with Netanyahu about the ceasefire, which Israel also agreed to as long as it was not struck again by Iran.\n\nVice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff negotiated with the Iranians, through both direct and indirect channels, the person said. Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani helped broker the agreement, and Trump called the Gulf leader to thank him, the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump thanked Iran for providing a warning of its Monday attack, and he made a peace offering to end the brief but intense war. Trump said Iran fired 14 missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar, and 13 of them were intercepted, while the other one was deemed nonthreatening.\n\nTrump reported there were no American or Qatari casualties and very little damage from the attack.\n\nIran’s military had claimed it had carried out a “devastating and powerful” missile assault on the Al Udeid U.S. military base in Doha, but Qatar said the missiles were intercepted. U.S. officials said the base had been emptied out, lending credence to the notion Iran was merely saving face with the missile launch.\n\n\"They’ve gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,'' Trump said in his earlier post. \"I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.''\n\nContributing: Zac Anderson\n\nIran fires missiles at US base in Qatar: Where else could it strike?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The State Department said it has evacuated approximately 250 U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and their immediate family members from Israel on seven flights since June 21.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Iran's foreign minister in Moscow and told him there was no justification for the U.S. bombing of Iran, which he described as \"unprovoked aggression,\" according to the Kremlin. Putin added that Moscow is making efforts to assist the Iranian people.\n\n∎ Iranian official Ebrahim Zolfaqari warned that the U.S. should expect severe consequences. \"Mr. Trump, the gambler, you may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it,\" Zolfaqari said in English in a video shared Monday.\n\nReported attacks in Israel and Iran\n\nTrump's ceasefire announcement came after Iran had launched a fresh wave of missiles, killing four people, according to Israel's ambulance service, and as Iranian authorities reported nine people killed in an attack in northern Iran on Tuesday morning.\n\nWitnesses said they heard explosions near Tel Aviv and Beersheba in southern Israel. Iran's semi-official SNN news agency reported that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIn Iran, the deputy governor of the northern province of Gilan said four residential units were destroyed in a \"terrorist attack\" on Tuesday morning, killing nine people and injuring 33, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\n\n--Reuters\n\nTrump celebrates ceasefire while Israeli Forces say attacks continue\n\nThe president took to his social media platform Truth Social on Monday evening to celebrate the end of fighting between the two countries.\n\n“Israel & Iran came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, ‘PEACE!’ Trump proclaimed on the platform. “I knew the time was NOW. The World, and the Middle East, are the real WINNERS! Both Nations will see tremendous LOVE, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY in their futures. They have so much to gain, and yet, so much to lose if they stray from the road of RIGHTEOUSNESS & TRUTH. The future for Israel & Iran is UNLIMITED, & filled with great PROMISE. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!”\n\nThe White House told USA TODAY earlier in the evening that Trump spoke to Netanyahu and the emir of Qatar. Top-ranking U.S. officials spoke directly and indirectly to Tehran.\n\nIranian state media said the ceasefire came as a result of the nation’s retaliatory strikes, according to reporting by CNN. Trump called for the ceasefire “in a begging-like manner” after the attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar, an Iranian state anchor said.\n\nIranian attacks haven’t ceased yet, according to the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nMinutes before the president’s celebratory post, Israeli Defense Forces in a post on X announced an incoming attack: “Sirens sounding in Israel due to a missile launch from Iran.”\n\nAn hour later, Israeli forces said “for the third time in the last hour, Israelis are currently running to shelter due to another missile launch from Iran.”\n\nVance says Trump is working on long-term deal\n\nVice President JD Vance was about to do a live, in-studio interview on Fox News when Trump posted the cease-fire message. Vance said the administration had been working on the truce when he left the White House. \"So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line,\" Vance said.\n\nHe said the United States must now talk to Iran and Israel about what comes next, following days of strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites. \"I think that is what the president is really trying to figure out here, is to build a long-term settlement,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said Trump told his team the U.S. would now work to make sure Iran doesn't rebuild its nuclear capability in the future.\n\nAs for the six hours that Trump referred to, Vance said the fighting may continue for a few hours. \"And tomorrow really is a new day. The end of the 12-day war, the end of the Iranian nuclear program, and I really do believe, something big for peace in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nUS was ready for missiles, evacuated base\n\nA U.S. defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that Al Udeid Air Base was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. There were no reports of U.S. casualties, the official said.\n\nAnother U.S. official said on condition of anonymity that the base had been mostly evacuated, and that it appeared the Qatari military had fended off most missiles.\n\nMajed Al Ansari, foreign affairs spokesman for Qatar, issued a statement strongly condemning the missile launch, calling it \"a flagrant violation'' of the country's sovereignty. \"We reassure that Qatar’s air defenses successfully thwarted the attack,\" the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. has remained on alert with its 40,000 troops in the region two days after Trump ordered the bombing of Fordow, a uranium-enrichment facility deep inside a remote mountain in Iran, and facilities at Natanz and Isfahan. Trump convened his national security team Monday afternoon in the Situation Room.\n\nMany world leaders − including those from the UK, France and Germany − called for restraint and a return to diplomatic negotiations. The extent of the damage to the Iran nuclear sites remains in question because so far there has been no independent assessment.\n\nThe U.S. Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq had activated its air defense system out of concern of a potential attack, military officials told Reuters.\n\nWhat is the Al Udeid US military base in Qatar?\n\nAl Udeid is the sprawling hub of U.S. military air operations in the Middle East. There about 10,000 U.S. troops stationed there, on the outskirts of the capital of Doha.\n\nIts air operations center has overseen fighters, bombers and drones that have conducted combat missions in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nDignitaries make stops there frequently, including Trump and secretaries of Defense.\n\nTrump warns other countries not to supply nukes to Iran\n\nTrump warned other countries Monday not to supply nuclear weapons to Iran in response to the U.S. bombing, after a former Russian president suggested the option.\n\n“The ‘N word’ should not be treated so casually,” Trump said in a social media post, referring to nuclear weapons.Trump was alluding to a social media post by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, but questioned its accuracy. Medvedev’s post suggested “a number of countries are ready to directly support Iran with their own nuclear warheads.”−Bart Jansen\n\nSpeaker says no to House vote on war powers resolution\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Monday he didn’t think it was “an appropriate time” for the House to vote on a bipartisan war powers resolution pushed by two representatives, Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna.\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Johnson said, according to Punchbowl News. “For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same Commander in Chief authority under Article 2.''\n\nJohnson said President Joe Biden used the authority in three Middle East operations, and added: \"President Obama went on an eight-month campaign bombing Libya to take down the regime there. I never heard a Democrat balk about any of that. And suddenly now they're just up in arms. It's all politics. This is not a time for politics.”\n\nHis remarks will likely earn pushback from Massie and Khanna, who were looking to bring their measure to the floor for a vote, seeking to forbid the U.S. from \"unauthorized hostilities” in Iran after Trump ordered airstrikes at three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nLawmakers across the aisle have alleged that Trump’s order violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action. Some of Trump’s staunchest allies have split with him over Iran.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nStocks waver but regain footing, end up higher\n\nStocks wavered but quickly moved back into positive ground after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base Monday.

On Monday, Israel launched several strikes on the city, hitting near Evin Prison and several command and security operations centers.\n\nOil spikes on Iran strikes but drops again\n\nOil prices initially rose on reports of explosions over Qatar but dropped again as analysts said oil supplies remained safe. Just after 1:30 p.m. ET, oil prices were down 4.97% at $70.17 per barrel.\n\nAnalysts’ primary concern is if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the main artery that carries global oil supplies.\n\nIf transport through the Strait of Hormuz is significantly disrupted, oil prices could surge to $130-150 per barrel, said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.\n\n− Medora Lee\n\nNo U.S. forces present at Syrian military base reportedly attacked\n\nThere are no U.S. forces at the military base in Syria that reportedly had come under mortar fire, a U.S. official said Monday.\n\nThe official, who could not confirm whether an attack had occurred at the base, was not authorized to speak publicly about U.S. troop movements in the region. The alleged attack at a base in western Syria was first reported by Mehr, a news agency affiliated with the Iranian government.\n\nThe Pentagon has been bracing for a counterattack after the U.S. airstrikes Saturday on three nuclear facilities in Iran. The Pentagon has sent an additional aircraft carrier strike group to the region and bolstered air defenses to protect troops in recent weeks following Israel’s ongoing attacks on Iran.\n\nMilitia groups, funded and supplied by Iran, have regularly fired rockets, mortars and drones at bases with U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks typically do not cause casualties or major damage.\n\nIs it safe to travel abroad right now? Worldwide caution issued after US strikes on Iran\n\n'Bait and switch': Marjorie Taylor Greene blasts Trump on strike\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has been one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, but she’s not holding back in slamming his decision to bomb Iran. In a second lengthy social media post since the bombing, Greene accused Trump of a “bait and switch” with his supporters.\n\nGreene wrote in the Monday post that she campaigned with Trump on a “MAGA agenda” that included “NO MORE FOREIGN WARS. NO MORE REGIME CHANGE. WORLD PEACE.” Now, less than six months into Trump’s second administration, Greene wrote “we are back into foreign wars, regime change, and world war 3.”\n\n“It feels like a complete bait and switch to please the neocons, warmongers, military industrial complex contracts, and neocon tv personalities that MAGA hates and who were NEVER TRUMPERS!” Greene added.\n\nGreene was among a vocal MAGA contingent warning against attacking Iran before Trump decided to go forward with the strike. Greene has remained outspoken, saying in an earlier social media post that “I can also support President Trump … while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi, Zac Anderson\n\nTrump calls for low oil prices after U.S. airstrikes on Iran\n\nTrump called for oil prices not to increase after U.S. airstrikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran.\n\n“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN.

Dan Caine said.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce. MOPs, also known as the Guided Bomb Unit, or GBU-57, are GPS-guided weapons designed to burrow deep into underground targets, such as fortified tunnels or bunkers.

While neither Israel, nor the U.S., nor Europe wants to see a nuclear-armed Tehran, Trump until late last week was forcefully pushing negotations to end Iran's uranium enrichment program.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, launched its massive June 13 attack on nuclear and military facilities. Soon the president was warning the Iranian people of destruction and threatening Iran's supreme leader.\n\nSo what does Trump want? A negotiated solution? Regime change?

He is the singular guiding hand about what will be occurring from this point forward − as he has been.\"\n\nEarlier in the day as members of Trump's MAGA base urged the administration to stay out of the war, Vice President JD Vance said the answer isn't complicated.\n\nTrump, he said, \"has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years...The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment,\" Vance wrote on X. \"And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways − the easy way or the 'other' way.\"\n\nAfter first opposing Israeli strikes, Trump now celebrates them\n\nNot long before Israel launched a stunning surprise attack on Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, President Donald Trump was still holding out hope Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would accept a U.S. proposal to end its uranium enrichment program.\n\n\"As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in, because I think that would blow it. Might help it, actually. But it also could blow it,\" Trump told reporters on June 12.\n\nWhen the Israeli airstrikes first started punching holes in apartment houses and secret bases, U.S. officials were quick to say Washington wasn’t involved.\n\nSince then, over five days of a bitter air war, Trump has warmed to Israel’s campaign, bragging more than once that Israeli pilots were flying American-made jets, dropping American-made bombs.\n\n“We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,” he wrote on Truth Social on June 17. “Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’”\n\n“Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he added.\n\nTrump, Israel, Iran: A long history of assassinations\n\nPresident Trump’s threat to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei isn’t an idle boast. In January 2020, Trump ordered a fatal drone strike on Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Baghdad.\n\nBut it’s Israel that Iran truly fears, when it comes to targeted killings. Israel killed numerous top military leaders and nuclear scientists in its first wave of attacks on Iran on June 13 and has since killed other military leaders.\n\nA clandestine Israeli assassination program has taken the lives of several scientists who were key to the Iranian nuclear program over the last decade. And Israel killed Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July 2024 with a bomb hidden in his official guest house.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last year, as well as Nasrallah’s successor. Scores of Hezbollah operatives were killed and maimed by exploding pagers engineered by Israel. Hezbollah had been Iran’s strongest proxy in the region.\n\nWith Iran's clerical rulers suffering their worst security breach since taking power in 1979, the country's cyber security command banned officials from using communications devices and mobile phones, Fars news agency reported June 17.\n\nThe threats go both ways. In November 2024, federal prosecutors charged an Iranian man with plotting Trump’s assassination in revenge for Soleimani’s killing.\n\nTrump speaks to Netanyahu\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu June 17, according to a White House official, amid ongoing fighting between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe White House hasn’t released details of the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu.\n\nTrump also met with his top national security advisers in the White House Situation Room June 17 to discuss the war between Israel and Iran, having flown home from the G7 summit in Canada to focus on the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nUS embassy in Jerusalem closing due to 'security situation'\n\nThe United States is temporarily closing its embassy in Jerusalem as tensions mount in the conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nThe embassy will close June 18 through June 20, with staff directed to “shelter in place in and near their residences until further notice,” according to a security alert from the embassy.\n\nThe embassy statement cites “the security situation and ongoing conflict.”\n\nVance: 'Further action' might be needed against Iran\n\nVice President JD Vance raised the possiblity that Trump could order U.S. military action if Iran doesn't give up its nuclear enrichment program.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Vance made the case that Trump has been consistent in his opposition to Iran attaining a nuclear weapon, and that the president has offered them a peaceful alternative.\n\nThroughout the Israel-Iran shooting war, Trump \"has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens,\" Vance said. \"He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment.\"\n\n\"That decision ultimately belongs to the president,\" he added.\n\nIn a nod to rising anti-war sentiment from Republicans in Congress, Vance said that \"people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.\"\n\nAir raid sirens in Tel Aviv\n\nAir raid sirens wailed again in Tel Aviv shortly after 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. Eastern) as Israel and Iran continued their retaliatory strikes. The Israeli military said another volley of missiles was en route from Iran.\n\nLess than 30 minutes later, an all-clear message went out telling residents it was safe to leave their shelters. It was unclear if any of the missiles evaded air defenses.\n\nIsrael scored direct hit on Natanz nuclear site, UN watchdog says\n\nAn Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear complex at Natanz directly hit the underground uranium enrichment plant there, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said, after initially reporting it had been hit only indirectly.\n\nSince Israel's launched wide-ranging attacks on Iran on June 13, the International Atomic Energy Agency has been providing updates on the damage to nuclear sites − although it has not been able to carry out inspections.\n\nThe IAEA had previously said an above-ground pilot enrichment plant at Natanz was destroyed but the larger underground plant was not directly hit, although IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said June 16 its centrifuges had very likely been badly damaged by a strike on the plant's power supply.\n\nOn June 17 the agency revised its estimate, saying satellite imagery pointed to \"direct impacts on the underground enrichment halls at Natanz.\"\n\nTrump denies reaching out to Iran\n\nEarly on June 17, the president denied he had reached out to Tehran seeking an end to the five-day Iran-Israel air war, after earlier suggesting he was working toward a broad Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\"I have not reached out to Iran for 'Peace Talks' in any way, shape, or form,\" he wrote on Truth Social early on June 17. \"If they want to talk, they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal that was on the table - Would have saved a lot of lives!!!\"\n\nTrump did encourage his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Vice President JD Vance to offer to meet with the Iranians, a source familiar with those discussions said.\n\nA U.S. official separately said Witkoff sought to determine whether there was any room for diplomacy with the Iranians before Trump's statement on June 17 suggesting the time for talking was over.\n\nTrump: Flee Tehran\n\nTrump urged residents of Tehran to evacuate the night of June 16 and left the Group of Seven summitt in Alberta, Canada, a day early to focus on the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told reporters Trump was returning to Washington to work on a ceasefire, but Trump refuted that.\n\n\"Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump said he wants something that's \"better than a ceasefire,\" without elaborating.\n\n\"IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\" he said in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"And it's painful for both parties,\" he said \"but I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.\"\n\nU.S. embassy unable to evacuate Americans from Israel\n\nStaff and family members at the American Embassy in Jerusalem were sheltering in place before dawn on June 17.\n\n\"The U.S. Embassy is not in a position at this time to evacuate or directly assist Americans in departing Israel,\" the mission said in a security alert, noting that Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and Israel's seaports were closed.\n\nTrump's administration warned Americans not to travel to Israel the day before, as Iran retaliated for last week's strikes.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Israel urged its citizens to leave the country via land border crossings as soon as possible.\n\nU.S. posture is 'defensive,' Hegseth says\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on June 16 the U.S. still wants a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n“Of course,” Hegseth said on “Jesse Watters Primetime\" on Fox. ”We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. And we certainly hope that’s what happens here.”\n\nSanders, Massie, Khanna and AOC join forces to prevent U.S. strike on Iran\n\nSeveral members of Congress said they will cosponsor measures to block the United States from going to war with Iran.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a self-described \"constitutional conservative\" Republican from Kentucky, announced a measure \"to prohibit our involvement,\" and invited all members of Congress to cosponsor it.\n\n\"This is not our war. But if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution,\" Massie posted.\n\nProgressive Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York jumped at the invitation.\n\n\"No war in Iran,\" Khanna posted. \"It's time for every member to go on record. Are you with the neocons who led us into Iraq or do you stand with the American people?\"\n\nAn hour later, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he had \"introduced legislation to stop Trump from... leading us into an illegal war with Iran.\"\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said earlier on June 16 he would introduce a war powers resolution in the Senate.\n\nIran wanted Trump to rein in Israel\n\n\"If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,\" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X, imploring Trump to intervene with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press President Donald Trump to use his influence on Netanyahu and push for an immediate ceasefire. In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.\n\nIsrael launched a powerful attack; Iran struck back\n\nIsrael struck first on June 13. In a surprise attack, it killed top military commanders and nuclear scientists. Airstrikes on Iran have also taken at least two of Iran's uranium enrichments sites offline.\n\nIran has retaliated with waves of ballistic missiles that have pierced Israel's defenses, striking residential neighborhoods.\n\nNetanyahu told troops at an air base that Israel was on its way to achieving its two main aims: wiping out Iran's nuclear program and destroying its missiles.\n\nBy midday on June 16, officials from each country said 224 Iranians and 24 Israelis had been killed in the conflict.\n\nTrump leaves summit: 'I have to be back'\n\nTrump was at the G7 Summit in Canada when he sent his stark warning to Iran. Not long after, the White House abruptly said he would return to Washington early to focus on the deepening conflict.\n\nAt a photo with world leaders, Trump told reporters: \"I have to be back early.\"\n\n\"You probably see what I see, and I have to be back as soon as I can,\" the president said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also left Canada for Washington.\n\nContributing: Ben Adler, USA TODAY; Reuters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/06/27/trump-basks-in-another-peace-deal-this-one-in-africa/84383556007/", "title": "Trump basks in another peace deal, this one in Africa", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump has announced an accord between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda that the administration hopes will lead to peace in the African nation and pave the way for U.S. investment.\n\nTrump said he arranged a treaty between the nations in a June 20 post on social media, in which he credited Secretary of State Marco Rubio for helping to bring the nations together. He hosted the countries' top diplomats on June 27 in the Oval Office.\n\n\"First time in many years, they're going to have peace. It's a big deal,\" Trump said at an earlier news conference.\n\nRubio hosted a signing ceremony between Democratic Republic of the Congo Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner and Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe at the Department of State immediately before the meeting with Trump.\n\nThe deal came together amid the Israel-Iran conflict, in which Trump later brokered a ceasefire, and as his administration works to end conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nThe seizure of large parts of eastern Congo by the M23 rebel group has killed more than 7,000 people this year alone and displaced more than 450,000 others, the DRC's government said in February. The area is home to the DRC's valuable mineral deposits.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council called on Rwanda to end its support for the rebels in a February resolution that urged the two countries to reengage in diplomatic talks. Rwanda denies backing the rebels.\n\nThe Biden administration sought to resolve the conflict but was unable to secure a deal before the one-term president left office.\n\nTrump's administration hopes the resolution will bring about an end to a broader conflict that has resulted in the displacement of more than 7 million people. Conflict in eastern Congo over in the three decades since the Rwandan genocide has led to an estimated 6 million deaths.\n\nMore than 18,000 Congolese refugees resettled in the U.S., in 2023, according to the Department of Homeland Security. It was the leading country of nationality for refugees accepted by the United States that year and over the preceding decade.\n\nState Department deputy spokesman Tommy Piggott said at a June 26 briefing the signing is a \"significant milestone\" but \"peace on paper must be matched by implementation on the ground.\"\n\nThe State Department spokesman said the agreement includes respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities, disarmament, the return of refugees and internally displaced persons and a regional economic framework.\n\nThe deal is central to the administration's approach to conflict reduction around the globe. By enabling and facilitating economic investment in war-torn countries such the DRC and Ukraine, the Trump administration hopes it can unlock lasting peace agreements.\n\n\"A durable peace in the Great Lakes region will open the door for greater U.S. and broader Western investment, which will bring about economic opportunities and prosperity,\" Rubio said on April 25 as he announced the framework agreement. \"It’s, as they call it, a win-win for everyone involved.\"\n\nBusinessman Massad Boulos, the administration's senior advisor for Africa and father-in-law of the president's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, is working to secure a critical minerals deal with the DRC that could billions in U.S. investment to the country.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has substantial reserves of gold, cobalt, and high-grade copper that have been inaccessible due to the security risks and underdeveloped infrastructure, the International Trade Administration says.\n\nCobalt is used to make the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are used in electric vehicles, laptops, tablets and smartphones.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/27"}]}

About Elon Musk's ...", "text": "SpaceX has designs on expanding Starship operations to Florida at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Base, with plans for a launch by end of 2025.\n\nSpaceX is developing Starship specifically with a Martian destination in mind. The first uncrewed trip could happen in 2026, Musk has said.\n\nUnder Musk's vision, humans would not just step on the planet before departing, but would remain to establish a settlement that could function independently if a cataclysmic event ever occurred.\n\nThe idea that humans could one day populate and even colonize Mars is one no longer confined to the realm of science fiction.\n\nAstronauts are on the cusp in the years ahead of journeying all the way to the Red Planet, where so far only rovers and orbiters have dared to venture. And when they do, it's likely they'll make landfall aboard a SpaceX Starship.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the vision of paving the way to create a self-sustaining colony on the Red Planet. By April 2023, the company rolled out its massive Starship – the rocket/spacecraft combo designed to reach Mars – to its South Texas launch pad for what would be its first of nine flight tests to date.\n\nWhile Starship has endured a few explosive setbacks in 2025, SpaceX is preparing for a mission it refers to as flight 10 as early as Sunday, Aug. 24, to get the vehicle's development back on track. But Starship has a long way to go before it can carry the first spacefarers to Mars and fulfill Musk's oft-stated dream of \"making life multiplanetary.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about Elon Musk's goal of setting up the first human city on Mars, and how Starship, which could soon fly again for the first time since May 27 – and from Florida by the end of 2025 – fits in to those plans.\n\nWhy is Elon Musk interested in sending Starship to Mars?\n\nMusk, who has often spoken publicly about his Mars vision, delivered his latest public updates in late May in front of employees from Starbase, SpaceX's headquarters near the U.S.-Mexico border that recently became its own Texas city.\n\nIn a video SpaceX shared May 29 on social media site X, which Musk owns, the world's richest man described to his employees the goal of sending humans to Mars as essential “for the long term survival of civilization.\" Under Musk's vision, humans would not just step on the planet before departing, but would remain to establish a settlement that could function independently if any cataclysmic event were to ever happen on Earth.\n\nSo, why Mars, as opposed to, say, Jupiter or Venus?\n\nWell, while other planets in our solar system are anything but habitable for humans, Mars gets a decent amount of sunlight, has water sources and is already a planet where humanity has sent robotic rovers to scout the terrain. At an average distance of 140 million miles from Earth, it's also one of our closest cosmic neighbors.\n\nWhile Mars has a thin atmosphere and is relatively cold, SpaceX claims on its website, \"we can warm it up.\"\n\nGravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth's, meaning humans would be able to lift heavier objects and bound around.\n\nWhat is Starship? World's largest rocket developed for travel to Mars\n\nSpaceX is developing Starship specifically with a Martian destination in mind. The spacecraft is designed to be a fully reusable transportation system, meaning the rocket and vehicle can return to the ground for additional missions.\n\nThe Starship, standing 403 feet tall when fully stacked, is regarded as the world’s largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever developed. When fully integrated, the launch system is composed of both a 232-foot Super Heavy rocket and the 171-foot upper stage Starship itself, the spacecraft where crew and cargo would ride.\n\nSuper Heavy alone is powered by 33 of SpaceX’s Raptor engines that give the initial burst of thrust at liftoff. The upper stage Starship section is powered by six Raptor engines that will ultimately travel in orbit.\n\nWhen could SpaceX launch Starship to Mars?\n\nMusk wants to send the first uncrewed Starship to Mars by the end of 2026 for a very critical reason: The timeline coincides with an orbital alignment around the sun that would shorten the journey between Earth and Mars.\n\nIt's a slim window that occurs once about every two years, and if SpaceX misses it, Musk has said the company would target another mission during the next alignment. If Starship were to blast off for the Red Planet by the end of 2026, the journey itself would take between seven to nine months.\n\nWhile no humans would have a seat on the first flight to Mars, Starship won't be empty. Instead, the vehicle would carry one or more Optimus robots designed and built by Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company.\n\nWhere, how would Starship land on Mars?\n\nStarship would enter Mars' atmosphere while zooming at 4.6 miles per second before it begins decelerating. The vehicle's heatshield is designed to withstand multiple atmospheric entries, but the Martian environment is expected to be harsher on the spacecraft, given its higher levels of atomic oxygen in the atmosphere, according to SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX is still considering multiple potential landing sites on Mars for Starship, but the leading contender appears to be a region known as Arcadia. The volcanic plain is on Mars' northern hemisphere far from the planet's frigid poles, with access to water sources in the form of shallow ice.\n\nArcadia is also flat enough to make landings and takeoffs relatively safer, Musk has said.\n\nWhat happens when the first humans arrive on Mars?\n\nCrewed trips with humans would then follow most likely in the early 2030s, Musk has claimed.\n\nMusk said he envisions eventually launching 1,000 to 2,000 Starships to Mars every two years so enough people and supplies can make it to the surface to quickly establish a livable, self-sufficient city.\n\nAchieving that goal would require more than 1 million Martian residents and millions of tons of cargo, according to SpaceX. For that reason, the company has an ambitious target of one day in the years ahead launching Starship more than 10 times per day from Earth to Mars during those crucial transfer windows every 26 months.\n\nThe first humans on Mars would be tasked with taking account of local resources, setting up landing operations, establishing a power source and building homes.\n\nHow does Musk's vision fit in with Trump's, align with NASA's Artemis campaign?\n\nNASA also has designs on astronauts reaching Mars – even if the agency's plan of attack differs from Musk's.\n\nStarship is crucial to the U.S. space agency's goal of returning astronauts to the moon's surface for the first time in five decades. NASA's lunar exploration plans call for Artemis III astronauts aboard the Orion capsule to board the Starship while in orbit for a ride to the moon's surface as early as 2027.\n\nOnce NASA has established a basecamp on the lunar south pole in the years ahead, the agency envisions sending humans from the moon on to Mars.\n\nMusk, though, has long favored a more aggressive Earth-to-Mars approach.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also outlined in his January inauguration speech his intent for humans to \"plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars\" during his second term – a vision from which he hasn't appeared to waver even after a public spat with Musk in June.\n\nWhile Trump has proposed a significant 25% slash to NASA's overall budget, the cuts mostly target the space agency's science programs while increasing funding for space exploration – including missions to Mars. The White House's 2026 budget proposal calls for allocating more than $1 billion for Mars exploration, while an additional $10 billion in funding for NASA was included in Republican spending legislation known as the One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\nTrump also signed earlier in August an executive order aimed at rolling back federal regulations on commercial spaceflight companies, including SpaceX. The move came a few months after the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, gave approval in May for SpaceX to conduct as many as 25 Starship test flights a year as Musk seeks to ramp up development of the Mars-bound spacecraft.\n\nSpaceX also has designs on expanding Starship operations to Florida at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Base, with plans to conduct a Sunshine State launch potentially by the end of 2025.\n\nWhen is the next Starship launch from Starbase, Texas?\n\nSpaceX plans to conduct the 10th flight test of its Starship spacecraft Sunday, Aug. 24, with a target liftoff time of 7:30 p.m. ET the company's Starbase headquarters in Cameron County, about 23 miles from Brownsville.\n\nEric Lagatta is the Space Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Construction is underway despite the threat of a lawsuit that could stall or stop it.\n\nThe Hell's Kitchen 1 plant, the first of as many as seven that are planned atop a massive, underground lithium brine reserve by developer Controlled Thermal Resources, is billed by the company as the world's first \"fully integrated\" lithium and renewable power production facility. By extracting boiling, mineral-rich brine from underground, the plant will create about 40 megawatts of steam power, then separate raw lithium out of the waste stream, and produce an expected 25,000 metric tons of commercial-grade lithium hydroxide each year. That's enough for approximately 415,000 electric vehicle batteries.\n\n\"Today, we are building the foundations for a truly sustainable battery materials and clean energy campus that will ... set new standards for battery supply chain integration in the United States,\" CTR's Chief Executive Officer Rod Colwell said. \"This has been a massive collaborative effort that required a coordinated approach across all levels of government and an incredible amount of support from our community.”\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who also spoke at the event, stressed the fiscal benefits the project could bring to the impoverished area.\n\n“As we put shovels in the ground and officially launch the Lithium Valley Campus, I’m optimistic that we are poised to begin an economic renaissance right here in the Imperial Valley,\" he said. \"Controlled Thermal Resources is literally creating our country’s clean energy future – a future supported by good-paying union jobs and unlimited potential for future economic investment and growth.”\n\nThe project also received enthusiastically unanimous approvals on Tuesday from the Imperial County Board of Supervisors.\n\nShovels and a lawsuit\n\nBut even after more than a decade of work, the groundbreaking might be premature.\n\nAs soon as Tuesday's votes concluded, an attorney for the nonprofit Comite Civico del Valle handed the clerk of the board written notice of intent to sue to overturn the approvals, because of what the group says were inadequate environmental reviews of potential harm from the project to the area's destitute residents, who suffer elevated rates of asthma and heart disease.\n\nThe group's concerns include overuse of rapidly disappearing Colorado River water by CTR and nearby projects, potential pollution from construction equipment and diesel trucks to and from the site, unaddressed earthquake risks and inadequate long-term monitoring of hazardous waste, dust and other potential health hazards from a newly developed technology, according to lengthy written comments from and interviews with the group and their attorney Jordan Sisson.\n\n\"It's very clear in our 150 pages of comments. We raised significant concerns about the water usage, hazards and the lack of ongoing data monitoring and ability to implement best practices and future mitigation measures for this novel operation,\" Sisson said. The legal notice says the California Environmental Quality Act and local zoning laws were not properly followed, and calls for further reviews or negotiations.\n\n'12 years of crawling across a hot desert'\n\nBut Colwell of CTR strongly defended the project and its environmental bona fides. He noted they had agreed to pave dirt roads, and with help from Podesta's office and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, won expedited approvals for a 340 wetland on site next to a state-owned wetland that provides critical habitat for rare species. Wetlands also can help contain potentially toxic dust from the rapidly drying edge of the Salton Sea, which has been fed by pesticide- and fertilizer-laden runoff from area farms for more than a century, experts say, as well as a sewage-polluted river from northern Mexico.\n\n\"We responded very precisely to the very detailed CEQA document, there's no cracks in it,\" exclaimed Colwell. \"We've designed the cleanest clean energy project on the planet.\"\n\nNoting that the project has taken more than a decade to develop, during which technology has been perfected, acreage and mineral rights acquired, water supply guaranteed and hundreds of millions in initial funding obtained, Colwell said, \"It's been 12 years of crawling across the hot desert through broken glass to get this project done right.\"\n\nHe acknowledged there could be some construction emissions, but said as a green energy company, they are also seeking to have electrified truck fleets use the site long-term.\n\nJobs and revenues for an impoverished county\n\nThe board of supervisors held the hearing Tuesday after CCV appealed approvals and permits issued in December by the county planning commission. The supervisors and a large majority of public speakers lauded the project, and endorsed moving it forward immediately.\n\n\"We will welcome you with open arms,\" board chairman Luis Plancarte said. Fifth District Supervisor John Hawk, also an area farmer, said any overuse of water could be easily addressed with the Imperial Irrigation District's active conservation programs.\n\nHe also dismissed Sisson's claims of inadequate reviews as \"shallow,\" \"broad\" and \"vague.\" He said the company had surmounted \"an enormous hurdle\" in its extensive reviews, \"not to mention the jobs, the opportunities.\"\n\n\"I support Imperial County jobs, I support Imperial County's future, and I believe the applicant has performed their due diligence,\" said Fourth District Supervisor Ryan Kelley, who has spent a decade seeking federal and state backing for lithium development in Imperial County.\n\n*An independent fiscal analyst hired by the county noted the project would generate nearly half a billion dollars over several decades in lithium production fees and property and sales tax revenues. An estimated 250 construction jobs and about 75 full-time jobs, with an average estimated annual salary of $85,000, are also projected to be created. Imperial County's average income per capita in 2022 was $21,216.\n\nLocal, regional and state union representatives crowded the room, and spoke in favor of the project, noting CTR had signed a project labor agreement to use union-represented ironworkers, boilermakers, and other trades.\n\n'Heartbeat of Mother Earth'\n\nBut members of three area tribes testified that the project is on and near sacred grounds for them, home to \"mud pots\" where hot steam bubbles up from underground that represent \"the heartbeat of Mother Earth,\" in the words of Carmen Lucas, an elder in the Kwaaymii Laguna Band of Indians. She and the others said the applicant had not conducted adequate, federally required consultation with them.\n\nColwell said Thursday that they have consulted and continue to consult with an area tribal affairs council, and is committed to providing benefits to the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla tribe, which holds lands closest to the site.\n\nThe steam that creates the mud pots is also what powers more than a dozen existing geothermal steam plants. It is released from a boiling hot brine pool that sits as deep as 2 miles underground there, and which contains raw lithium and other minerals.\n\nBigwigs on hand for 'green energy' ground-breaking\n\nFor decades, the lithium was reinjected below ground as waste, but it is now a key ingredient in electric vehicles, renewable energy commercial batteries and smart phones, and has shot up in value. CTR is one of at least five companies either developing or exploring lithium extraction projects here, in an area dubbed Lithium Valley or the Saudi Arabia of lithium. By separating it from relatively clean steam, such projects avoid far more environmentally destructive hard rock mining or massive salt evaporation ponds used elsewhere.\n\nGeneral Motors and Stellantis, which manufactures Jeeps and other brands, have both invested in the project, and GM had two senior executives representatives at Friday's ground-breaking. CTR's first project could create just shy of 50 megawatts of steam, much of which will be used to produce tons of commercially usable lithium on site.\n\nU.S. Rep Raul Ruiz, the chairman of the California Energy Commission, the head of state's building trades and construction council and an estimated 185 other public and industry officials also attended Friday's event.\n\nLuis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, expressed \"cautious optimism\" about the Hell's Kitchen project in a 2021 letter to Podesta, and said in an interview, \"we support the clean energy transition wholeheartedly.\" In an interview this week, he said he also supports the CR project overall and the union jobs it will create, as long as it does not create environmental and public health risks.\n\n\"We support labor 100%, we support their values and we support good jobs ... but we can't just ignore the environmental standards,\" he said. \"The jobs it will create, that box was checked, and we celebrated it, but that doesn't mean we're going to ignore public health and the risk to the ecosystem.\"\n\nHe said his and other community groups' concerns were not last-minute, but had been raised for months.\n\n\"These are not eleventh-hour submittals, we made every effort to resolve them,\" Olmedo said. \"We gave the company every opportunity and we reached out and told the county repeatedly about our concerns.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta held an environmental justice round table at CCV's offices in Brawley on Monday, and has also taken on CEQA challenges in the past. Olmedo said they explained the Hell's Kitchen EIR to him in detail, and he is aware of the concerns. Bonta's spokesman did nor immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut Coldwell reiterated that millions of dollars had been spent to design an environmentally sound project, said the company had consulted with Olmedo's group and many others, and he was baffled by the claims that CEQA had no been complied with. He said the project is moving forward, and a company spokeswoman noted nearly 200 elected officials and supporters will be there on Friday.\n\n\"We are commencing construction immediately, hence the groundbreaking,\" Colwell said.\n\nSisson, the attorney for CVC, said, \"They can build at their own risk, subject to the outcome of potential litigation, whether that's a CEQA lawsuit, or perhaps a preliminary injunction. Those are potential options.\"\n\nAsked if he intends to seek an injunction to halt work, Sisson said, \"No comment at this time.\"\n\n*Correction: A previous version of this story included a mistake about the hiring and funding process.

The administration declined to detail which projects, specifically. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Military Academy at West Point is on the list.\n\n“It is a slap in the face to the members of the armed forces who serve our country that President Trump is willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump could use billions in a separate pot of military funding to begin building a portion of the wall along the nation's southern border.

Since then, Trump has said the investments have swelled to $14 trillion, or roughly half of the nation's annual gross domestic product.\n\nThe White House calls it \"The Trump Effect\" and features a rolling list on its website of more than 70 projects it says Trump's economic policies spurred, from a new bakery plant in Texas to a LEGO facility in Virginia and a microchip plant in Arizona.\n\nAs of July 2, the website listed more than $2.6 trillion in U.S. investments, well short of the $14 trillion Trump boasts about.\n\nBut a Reuters review found that just under half of the claimed spending on the website - totaling more than $1.3 trillion - originated under former President Joe Biden or represented routine spending repackaged to promote domestic investments.\n\nAt least eight of the projects touted by the White House had sought or secured critical local incentive packages before Trump took office while at least a half dozen other projects had already been announced by local officials or the companies themselves, Reuters found.\n\nTwo of the Trump Effect projects were aided by Biden's legislative efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, the review found.\n\nOne company on the list, Swiss-based Roche, warned that Trump's plans to equalize U.S. and international drug prices now threatens its promised $50 billion in U.S. investments.\n\nAsked about taking credit for projects already underway before Trump came into office, the White House said the final investment decisions were announced under his watch and prove his economic policies are triggering U.S. investment.\n\n“President Trump is the greatest closer in modern history, and his leadership and policies are a critical catalyst converting hypothetical discussions into firm investment commitments and ground being broken for new plants and offices,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nThe Reuters review included interviewing local officials and reviewing public records and corporate statements. It was not clear in many cases what role, if any, Trump or his policies played in getting the deals across the line.\n\nMark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said his economic forecast - along with the consensus estimates - for investment in the economy has remained relatively unchanged despite the White House's claims of new historic investments.\n\n\"I think despite all the announcements it hasn't translated into any change in expectations,\" Zandi said. \"The fundamentals that ultimately drive investment spending, broadly, if anything, appear to have weakened since the start of the year.\"\n\nTrump's push to impose sweeping tariffs on dozens of trading partners has injected uncertainty into global markets, lowering economic projections and freezing investment decisions, Zandi said.\n\nTrump's supporters say his policies of deregulation combined with the extension of his corporate tax cuts last week have stoked interest from companies that will be converted into actual investments in the months ahead.\n\n\"I think you're going to see a lot more investment later this year, and certainly into next year,\" Richard Stern, director of economic and budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said.\n\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT\n\nThe Trump Effect list is not exhaustive, according to the White House, and does not include the foreign deals the administration says Trump secured during his Middle East tour in May.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a Reuters request to provide a breakdown of the $14 trillion in U.S. investments Trump claims he has attracted.\n\nTrump wouldn't be the first president to inflate or embellish economic activity on his watch. But the onetime businessman has made his dealmaking the centerpiece of his political persona, promising his presidency would ignite a manufacturing renaissance that would bring jobs back to the U.S.\n\nSome companies, largely in the pharmaceutical industry, repackaged existing spending that was later touted as new investment by Trump. The pharmaceutical companies also credited Trump's 2017 tax cuts for spurring domestic investment.\n\nEli Lilly CEO David Ricks created the blueprint, said James Shin, a pharmaceutical analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. Ricks joined top administration officials in February to announce $27 billion in new U.S. investments over five years.\n\nThe figure drew praise from Trump who said it's evidence his tariffs were working to spur domestic manufacturing, but the figure represented a slight increase over the $23 million the company spent in the U.S. since 2020.\n\n\"Everyone saw that Donald Trump gave David Ricks blessings every time he spoke,\" Shin said. \"I think Lilly was quite shrewd in its timing and in its messaging.\"\n\nAn Eli Lilly spokesperson did not address Reuters questions about the company's incremental increase in spending and what role Trump played, if any, in its announcement.\n\nCLAIMING CREDIT\n\nHere's a sampling of the projects included on the White House's Trump Effect website that Reuters found had been announced or were already in the pipeline prior to Trump's presidency:\n\nHyundai: The South Korean carmaker was added to the Trump Effect list after announcing a $5.8 billion new Louisiana steel plant in March. But the company selected the Louisiana site in December 2024 after conducting a nationwide search, according to a state official. Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment,\n\nCorning: The global materials science company was added to the list after a $1.5 billion investment in Michigan was highlighted in an April press release.\n\nBut the figure includes $900 million in funding announced in February of last year for the plant, and the project has benefited from federal tax credits under the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan measure passed under Biden that incentivizes domestic production, the company confirmed to Reuters.\n\nTrump has called for Congress to claw back the chips funding, calling the legislation a \"horrible, horrible thing.\"\n\nThe company would not say whether Trump had any direct connection to the investment.\n\nLEGO: The iconic toy manufacturer announced a new $366 million distribution center in Virginia in May and was added to the Trump website. The company began working with Virginia on a package of state and local incentives in 2022, roughly three years before Trump took office, according to Pryor Green, the Virginia economic development spokesperson.\n\nThe company did not respond to request for comment.\n\nClasen Quality Chocolate: The candy company announced a new $230 million production facility in Virginia in February and was added to Trump's website.\n\nBut the Virginia Economic Development Partnership began working with the company roughly seven months before Trump took office, and Governor Glenn Youngkin approved a $3 million grant for the project on December 3, Green told Reuters.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChobani: The White House added the yogurt maker to its list after the company in April announced a $1.2 billion production plant in New York. But Chobani, which did not respond to a request for comment, had reached out to the state in May of last year about the project, state records show, and benefited from a state program that lures companies with shovel-ready sites.\n\nLOCAL INCENTIVES\n\nSome other deals touted by Trump were either struck before he took office, spurred by state and local incentive packages or represent routine capital investment, the Reuters review found.\n\nPharmaceutical companies Merck and Johnson & Johnson both announced billions of dollars in U.S. investments that included projects that were previously announced and already under construction, according to a review of company statements.\n\nThe White House list included $2 billion in Merck projects already underway in North Carolina and Delaware and a $2 billion North Carolina project under construction by Johnson & Johnson, statements show.\n\nJohnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment, and Merck did not address Reuters' questions about Trump's role in its investment decisions.\n\nMany of the projects on the list relied heavily on state and local incentive packages - such as grants or tax breaks - that were approved prior to Trump taking office in January, Reuters found. States typically compete against one another for company investments, using incentive packages as bait.\n\nThe locally-backed projects on the Trump Effect list include Diageo, a British alcoholic beverage company, whose $415 million new Alabama plant was aided by state and local tax incentives that date back to 2022, roughly three years before Trump took office, according to Stefania Jones, an Alabama Department of Commerce spokesperson.\n\nDiageo did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIreland-based power management company Eaton Corporation, French ceramics manufacturer Saint-Gobain and South Korean baker Paris Baguette, for example, were all highlighted on the Trump Effect list, but records and interviews show they all secured local incentive packages before Trump took office.\n\nThe companies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTECH INVESTMENTS\n\nIn some cases, the investment touted by the White House and the companies represented the normal cost of business.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook announced in February that his iconic company was going to invest $500 billion over five years to hire 20,000 workers and build new AI servers. Trump seized on the announcement, saying on his Truth Social media platform that it showed \"faith in what we are doing.\"\n\nHowever, Apple’s announced figure is in line with what one might expect the company to be spending anyway, given its financials, according to three analysts.\n\n\"For Apple, most of this would have happened regardless of who's president,\" said Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\nIt also echoes previous commitments.\n\nFour years ago, a few months after Biden’s inauguration, Apple announced an “acceleration” of its U.S. investments, pledging to spend $430 billion and add 20,000 jobs over five years.\n\nIn January 2018, during Trump’s first term, the company said that its “direct contribution to the U.S. economy” would be $350 billion over five years and that it planned to create 20,000 jobs over that period.\n\nAnother pledge to spend $500 billion for new data centers to power artificial intelligence programs dubbed \"Stargate\" came from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and business software giant Oracle, whose executives joined Trump in the White House on his first full day as president in January to make the announcement.\n\nThe companies said they planned to spend $100 billion “immediately” but that they were still in negotiations with various states about where to place the new data centers.\n\n“As announced in January, Stargate remains fully committed to investing up to $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure in the United States,\" SoftBank and OpenAI said in a joint statement to Reuters.\n\nOracle did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Jarrett RenshawEditing by Colleen Jenkins and Michael Learmonth)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/23/trump-rose-garden-remodel-white-house-changes/84322834007/", "title": "Grass for gravel: Trump's Rose Garden revamp makes progress", "text": "WASHINGTON - Renovations are underway for the historic White House Rose Garden.\n\nConstruction crews broke ground on the outdoor area earlier in June after President Donald Trump ordered a major remodel, including replacing the grass with gravel.\n\nThe president has said in previous interviews he wanted the area paved for the ease of visitors − specifically those in heeled footwear. “What was happening is, that’s supposed to have events. Every event you have, it’s soaking wet,” Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in March. “It’s soaking wet ... and the women with the high heels, it’s just too much.”\n\nTrump said at the time the grass would go but the flowers can stay. “I think it’s going to be beautiful,” he told Fox. “I think it’s going to be more beautiful.”\n\nThe Rose Garden was first planted in 1913 during the Woodrow Wilson administration and has regularly hosted a variety of White House events, including speeches, press conferences and even weddings.\n\nFormer First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy famously brought in landscape designer Rachel Lambert Mellon in 1962 to craft one of the most iconic layouts for the garden outside the Oval Office.\n\nIn 2020, First Lady Melania Trump oversaw a Rose Garden revamp, including installing an updated irrigation system and replacing the flowers along the perimeter. The move received mixed reactions at the time, with some criticizing the look of the new garden and others condemning the unveiling’s timing, months into the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe more recent Rose Garden overhaul is one of several second-term renovations Trump has already launched.\n\nUnder his direction, an 88-foot flagpole hoisting a massive American flag was recently installed on the south lawn. A second, matching pole was added in front of the White House on June 18 as well.\n\n“How do you like it, everybody?” Trump said to reporters after the flag reached the top of the pole.\n\nThe inside of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave has been made over as well.\n\nSince taking office again in January, Trump has accessorized the executive mansion with splashes of gold trimming. The White House has also added new portraits of Trump to its walls and it recently exchanged a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. for Winston Churchill in the Oval Office.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/05/31/senator-kelly-sinema-debt-talks-push-changes-for-chipmakers/70271962007/", "title": "Kelly and Sinema used debt talks to push changes wanted by ...", "text": "Both of Arizona’s U.S. senators used talks to avert a government default to push to fast-track environmental studies and overhaul electricity rules that affect major manufacturing projects such as the semiconductor plants underway in Arizona.\n\nThe resulting agreement between the White House and House Republicans last weekend would make only modest changes to government studies for now, but the negotiations offer a measure of momentum on issues of rare common ground.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/sumner/2020/11/25/white-house-approves-highland-park-plan-330-apartments-and-townhomes/6326615002/", "title": "White House approves Highland Park plan for 330 apartments and ...", "text": "A plan to build 240 apartment units and 90 townhomes has been approved in White House, adding to the ongoing flurry of residential building projects taking place in and around the city.\n\nHighland Park is the working name of the project being developed by Land Solutions Company on a little more than 26 acres behind the Kroger shopping center on Highway 76.\n\nThe development will have a connecting road from Byrum Drive to the Indian Hills subdivision, said White House Planning Director Ceagus Clark.\n\nTennis courts that will be taken out with the road will be replaced with new ones.\n\nA tree line between existing homes and the future development will remain as a buffer, Clark said.\n\nTentative plans are to start construction around the middle of 2021 as details are being finalized, according Lynn Ealey, chief operating officer with the developer Land Solutions Company.\n\nFive or six apartment buildings are expected.

But his team’s task is getting people to pay attention – and give them credit for what they did.\n\nStarting Tuesday, Biden administration officials will start a weeks-long blitz across the country – including in many midterm battleground states, where they’ll appear with governors, senators and members of Congress – with a pitch focused on generating local attention and media coverage, either through in-person or virtual events with local officials.\n\nThis comes after multiple conversations over the summer with the Cabinet secretaries most focused on implementing the projects in which infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu stressed that they’d been selling the bill all wrong. They were talking too much about the win in Washington and less about how they projects would make a difference in people’s lives.\n\nBut now administration officials think they’re about to get a second chance: the way that the law was structured, the actual money – rather than promises of what could be – was always set to start flowing in August. And they’re hoping to draft off a larger sense of Biden wins from other major bills he’s gotten through in recent weeks.\n\nThere are over 5,300 infrastructure projects getting underway across the country – in every state, and multiple in every congressional district, from the smaller ones Landrieu refers to as “spreading the peanut butter” of the law’s funding to the massive ones Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has dubbed their “cathedral” projects. They range from laying wires for rural broadband to modernizing the terminals at Los Angeles International Airport. Administration officials hope that gives them enough to make infrastructure interesting – a perpetual problem for politicians, regardless of how many voters say it’s important to them.\n\n“The conversation in Washington has always been about the next fight, the next hill, the next bill – so much so that I think some folks seeing the tug of war over ‘Build Back Better’ kind of lost track of the fact that the infrastructure law passed,” said Buttigieg, referring to the struggle over Biden’s signature legislative package that was eventually passed in a scaled-back version earlier in August after months of intraparty squabbling.\n\n“It is important for them to know that that this bridge over the rail yard in Chattanooga that we just announced is coming to you because the President’s vision and ability to work with Congress, both sides of the aisle, to get funding for this,” he added.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, seen here testiyfng before the Senate in April.

Some red and blue, others green and white, all with “Funded By the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law” in big letters and the White House’s “Building a Better America” logo, with “President Joe Biden” written right in the middle. Oversize novelty checks to hand out on construction sites were considered, but ultimately nixed. There was no need, administration officials decided, to reinforce the focus on the law’s $1 trillion price tag.\n\nAdministration officials admit, though, that they flopped in getting out the word for the first nine months after passage, with the law getting lost in the shuffle of a year of other party infighting and bureaucracy.\n\n“You can’t just snap your fingers as though the country was ready on Day 1 to make sure that this all got built by Day 30. That’s not the way massive infrastructure projects work,” Landrieu told CNN. “That this is not at the top of people’s minds doesn’t mean that we can’t do big things.”\n\n“We have to do some work,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm acknowledged as she headed out of the White House last week after Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, which administration officials are also hitting the road to tout.\n\nWhite House officials are trying to learn some lessons from the credit-grabbing ways of former President Donald Trump, who famously went so far as having a letter with his signature on it placed in boxes of food handed out during the early days of the pandemic. They want to go further than former President Barack Obama’s efforts around his 2009 stimulus bill – in part because they have more money to announce now, and in part because they feel like Obama’s efforts, which included more muted signs, didn’t go far enough.\n\nThe administration-led effort comes as House Majority PAC, the group dedicated to trying to hold onto Democrats’ slim House majority, has started airing a new ad with the tag line “Democrats – Delivering for America’s Families.” The spot argues that after Biden inherited a “deeply damaged economy,” Democrats “went to work,” ticking through a list of accomplishments including “repairing our roads and bridges” and allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which was part of the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“The President says, ‘Look, I can’t sit in my office and turn a dial and move gas down. I can’t sit in my office and move inflation,’” Landrieu said. “But what I can do is ask Congress and my team to help me reduce everybody’s cost in other areas and wring efficiencies out of the system. That’s where the infrastructure bill comes into play.”\n\n‘Why ‘Love Actually’ starts and ends in an airport’\n\nBut the communication problems persist. Sitting in his office in the Old Executive Office Building, Landrieu said he’s even been having trouble talking infrastructure with his mother. She complained that the streets on the way to her doctor’s office were in bad shape. Now she’s complaining that the repairs are making it hard to get to her doctor on time.\n\n“I said, ‘Mama, you can’t have it both ways,’” Landrieu said. “And her answer was, ‘I can have it whichever way I want because I’m your mama.’”\n\nLandrieu, who’s headed to New Mexico and Pennsylvania this week, said he accepts most voters won’t be that different and that it’s hard to get the political benefit from infrastructure, as much as people say it’s important to them.\n\nMitch Landrieu, seen here speaking at the National Association of Counties legislative conference in February, is the White House infrastrucutre coordinator. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n“People are going to be frustrated because it’s not too fast, then they’re going to be frustrated because it’s getting built and it’s inconvenient,” Landrieu said. “And when it’s done, people may not even remember that it started.”\n\nButtigieg, in an interview in his office, recalled a mid-August visit to Phoenix and Tucson, where he stood with a company owner who talked about how much opening a new bridge would mean in terms of saving time and money on labor and gas by providing a more direct route.\n\nHe appeared with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who’s is in a tough reelection fight this year, and made sure to tell the crowd that he and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the state’s other Democratic senator, “were central players in negotiating this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that is directly funding projects like the fantastic one that we’re celebrating today.”\n\nWith a model of a new Amtrak train running on tracks on a conference table in his office, Buttigieg – who’s hitting Florida, Oklahoma, Nevada, Minnesota, Ohio and New Hampshire this week – stressed the conversation he wants to have about infrastructure, admitting that he was being a little cheesy.\n\n“We’re talking about the person who lives in Tell City [Indiana] and has a job at the foundry and is much better off now that this port is improved … or the woman I met in New Jersey who described not being the mother she wants to be because of her commute,” the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor said.\n\n“Transportation actually is at least the backdrop, sometimes the basis, for a lot of these really important things in our lives.

According to the fiscal 2025 defense policy bill, the military currently has roughly 46,000 dual-status technician positions distributed across crucial functions like helicopter and plane maintenance, technology support, weapons repair and administrative support for isolated units.\n\nThe catch? Dual-status technicians are, technically speaking, civilian employees of the Defense Department despite the inherently military aspects of their jobs. And during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Pentagon's civilian employees are going without pay, though many of them (including most technicians) must stay on the job due to the vital national security nature of their work.\n\nDual-status techs — deemed to be \"rare birds\" by the Supreme Court — often work shoulder-to-shoulder with active duty members of their units, receiving different pay and different benefits for similar duties and risks. Their active peers also received a full paycheck on Oct. 15 after Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to shift about $6.5 billion in funds to make payroll. (The Pentagon did not immediately respond to an inquiry from USA TODAY.)\n\nWill a paycheck arrive? Shutdown leaves military families in limbo.\n\nAdvocates for the technician community who spoke with USA TODAY expressed frustration over what they consider to be an unfair arrangement.\n\n\"It's not fair, obviously — you show up at any given unit, you can't tell who's who. (Active duty troops and technicians) are literally indistinguishable,\" said Retired Army Maj. Gen. Francis McGinn, who is president of the National Guard Association of the U.S. and former top general of the Massachusetts National Guard. He fears that paying techs \"slipped through the cracks\" amid the chaos of the shutdown.\n\nMcGinn added that furloughing or not paying dual status technicians risks harming the National Guard's readiness. The organization's aviation assets (which are largely kept flying by technician mechanics) often receive no-notice missions such as stranded hiker rescues or natural disaster responses.\n\nThe legislative director of the Association of Civilian Technicians, a union representing dual-status technicians, told USA TODAY that the Trump administration's moves against federal workers have \"demoralized\" this crucial subset of the military.\n\n\"These people are hired to do a job, and they're trying to do it well,\" said ACT's Les Hackett. \"Then you have people that are basically telling them that their jobs aren't needed and they're all lazy bums.\"\n\nHackett, who retired as both a National Guard member and dual status technician, and McGinn argued the pay disparity is just the latest manifestation of pay and benefits gaps for the employees. Dual status techs, unlike their peers, are ineligible for the military's health insurance (until 2030), don't accrue valuable time-based education benefits like the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, and can't receive VA disability treatment or payments for injuries suffered outside of drill weekends.\n\nThe former general, McGinn, contended that the simplest solution to the immediate problem is for Congress to pass a continuing resolution and negotiate a full-year defense spending bill.\n\nDisclosure: USA TODAY reporter Davis Winkie is a member of NGAUS.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/10/11/education-department-special-ed-office-layoffs-shutdown/86646104007/", "title": "Education Department wipes out special ed office in shutdown ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Education fired nearly everyone in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in a wave of new layoffs that began Friday, according to the union representing the agency's employees.\n\nWithout an official estimate from the agency, it wasn't immediately clear how many people in the division were fired. Yet based on reports from staff and their managers, most employees below the leadership level were part of the workforce reduction, said Rachel Gittleman, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252.\n\nSeparately, employees involved in the college access program known as TRIO, which is located in a different office, were also let go, she said.\n\nThe firings, which the union has challenged in court, \"double down on the harm to K-12 students and schools across the country,\" Gittleman told USA TODAY.\n\nSpokespeople for the Education Department did not respond to requests for comment Saturday. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has said on multiple occasions that safeguarding students with disabilities, and making sure they have access to the educational resources they're legally entitled to, is a top priority.\n\n\"I would like to see even more funding go to the states for that,\" she told CNN in March.\n\nIn a Friday court filing, the Justice Department said more than 460 Education Department employees had been laid off, cutting roughly a fifth of the agency's already-hamstrung workforce.\n\nThe terminations, which have hit more than half a dozen federal agencies, are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to pressure congressional Democrats to end the ongoing government shutdown. Nearly 90% of the Education Department is furloughed, too.\n\nAn Education Department staffer told USA TODAY the agency laid off just about every employee who works to administer funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, the primary federal law supporting students with disabilities. He was unsure how those programs will exist moving forward.\n\nRead more: Colleges report widespread problems with financial aid since Education Department layoffs\n\n\"The system is designed to happen at the school level, with oversight from the district, with oversight from the state, and then with oversight form the federal level,\" said Glenna Wright-Gallo, who served as assistant secretary in the office from 2023 to 2025. \"Now we're losing that checks and balances system.\"\n\nSecretary McMahon has suggested that oversight of IDEA funding could be better positioned in the Department of Health and Human Services, rather than at her agency. Officially moving it would take an act of Congress, though.\n\nIn the likely absence of federal wraparound services for students with disabilities, Wright-Gallo recommended that parents and advocates start paying more attention to support systems at the local and state level.\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

The White House began another round of firings across more than half a dozen agencies, laying off thousands of workers.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday, President Donald Trump promised to use the shutdown as an opportunity to exert more leverage over federal spending – a power that's historically (and legally) delegated mostly to Congress.\n\n\"We're being able to do things that we were unable to do before,\" he said. \"So we're closing up programs that are Democrat programs that we wanted to close up.\"\n\nDemocrats, so far, are unfazed, arguing the layoffs were already coming, shutdown or not.\n\nTrump admin says it will fund WIC with tariff revenue for 'foreseeable future'\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, the federal initiative known as WIC that provides resources to nearly 7 million low-income women and children, will stay afloat using tariff revenue for the \"foreseeable future,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told USA TODAY.\n\nA day before the shutdown began, the National WIC Association warned that the program would run out of money in a matter of weeks without Congress passing a new budget.\n\nAs that deadline neared last week, the White House announced it would sustain operations via a cash infusion, later reported by the Associated Press as being around $300 million.\n\n\"We welcome efforts to keep WIC afloat during the shutdown, but families need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty,\" said National WIC Association President and CEO Georgia Machell in an Oct. 7 statement. \"There is no substitute for Congress doing its job. WIC needs full-year funding, not just temporary lifelines.\"\n\nAre flights impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nIt's complicated. Transportation Security Administration officers and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers are considered essential employees. So they're required to work during the shutdown, even as they don't receive paychecks.\n\nWhile delay numbers have been fairly low overall, staffing issues at some air traffic control facilities have led to issues. Last week, the FAA had to delay flights into Burbank, California, because the tower there was unstaffed for a few hours in the evening.\n\nIt's important to note that not all delays during the shutdown are attributable to the funding lapse. Weather is still a major driver of flight delays, regardless of what's happening in Washington.\n\nStill, in previous shutdowns, these essential workers have eventually started to call out from work in increasing numbers, which has led to longer security lines and delays at some airports.\n\n– Zach Wichter and Kathleen Wong\n\nTrump says a 'wealthy donor' offered to help pay US military salaries\n\nTrump said he found a way to pay U.S. troops amid the ongoing federal government shutdown: A wealthy donor.\n\n\"I actually have a man who is a very wealthy person,\" he said during his meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House. Trump added that a \"donor, a great gentleman\" told him that if there was any \"shortfall\" to pay the troops, that he'd pay it.\n\nThe president said he told the donor that \"we're not going to need it.\"\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress writes the laws to pay the country's bills via money from the American taxpayer – not through wealthy individuals.\n\nIt’s been two weeks since the shutdown began, and federal employees like military members, law enforcement officers, and air traffic controllers deemed essential for public safety are required to work. They don't receive a paycheck until the shutdown is over.\n\nIs mail affected by the government shutdown?\n\nPostal services, including mail delivery, continue even when the government shuts down.\n\nIn a Sept. 25 statement, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed that its operations will not be interrupted in a shutdown, and post offices will remain open for \"business as usual.\"\n\n\"Because we are an independent entity that is generally funded through the sale of our products and services, and not by tax dollars, our services will not be impacted by a government shutdown,\" the statement said.\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans? What about FAFSA?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, borrowers are still required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department's contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department ceases new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department, as it plans to furlough the majority of its staff. Experts say while most borrowers won't \"feel\" a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nWhat happens to SNAP during a government shutdown?\n\nThe USDA, which oversees SNAP and similar programs through its Food and Nutrition Service division, has a contingency plan to maintain its core services during a government shutdown, at least temporarily.\n\nFunds for October's SNAP benefits were allocated before the month began, meaning payments are already being processed and distributed as usual. If the shutdown lasts longer, USDA could tap into multiyear contingency funds that can be used for administrative expenses and/or to pay participant benefits directly, according to the USDA plan. It is unclear how much money is currently available in that reserve.\n\nThese measures are a temporary means of keeping FNS running, however. Existing continuing resolutions, or temporary funding measures, generally only allow the USDA to disburse benefits 30 days after a shutdown begins, and funding can run out.\n\nIf the shutdown lasts beyond October, it could exhaust the USDA's contingency plan, and the administration could choose not to tap into the multiyear fund, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Food Research & Action Center.\n\nAre Social Security payments still going out during shutdown?\n\nYes, Social Security payments, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and benefits for retirement, disability and survivors, continue during a government shutdown.\n\nBecause Social Security benefit programs are considered mandatory spending by law, they are not impacted by the lapse in funding appropriations. Payments are still distributed on a regular schedule during the shutdown.\n\nSome airports reject TSA video blaming Democrats for shutdown\n\nAirports in Charlotte, Phoenix, Portland, and Seattle declined to air a Department of Homeland Security video blaming Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, citing bans on political content and concerns over violating the Hatch Act.\n\nThe video, featuring Secretary Kristi Noem, warned of TSA disruptions due to Congress' inaction.\n\nAirport officials said airing it would breach laws prohibiting political messaging on public property. Homeland Security defended the message, saying TSA employees are working unpaid but operations remain stable. The shutdown, now in its second week, has strained travel operations, with delays mounting and the U.S. travel economy losing $1 billion weekly.\n\n– Nathan Diller\n\nSome VA services impacted\n\nSome of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' services have been impacted by the shutdown as thousands of its employees have been furloughed.\n\nVA benefits like compensation, pension, education and housing are running as usual. Medical centers and clinics remain open. Support services for suicide prevention, homelessness and caregivers are also still available.\n\nHowever, during the shutdown, VA benefits regional offices are closed, transition program assistance has ceased and VA cemetery grounds are not being maintained. Outreach efforts through social media and emails have also stopped.\n\nIn an Oct. 7 letter to VA Secretary Doug Collins, members of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees criticized the VA's response to the shutdown. The lawmakers said the agency has been misleading over claims that it can't respond to communications from members of Congress during the shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, in an op-ed for The Hill published on Oct. 10, Collins called the actions of Congressional Democrats \"one of the biggest displays of hypocrisy in recent history.\"\n\nWhat time is the Senate vote?\n\nThe Senate will take up the GOP's short-term funding extension for the eighth time at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday. It's expected to fail again.\n\nThe chamber will not, however, vote on the Democrats' funding bill, which has never had a good shot at passing.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nTrump cabinet members blame upcoming 'No Kings' protests for prolonging shutdown\n\nTwo of Trump's cabinet secretaries said Democrats are keeping the government closed for the sake of \"No Kings\" mass protests scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 18.\n\nThe comments, made on the same Fox Business show on Oct. 13, echo congressional Republicans last week who blamed the now two-week-long shutdown on Democrats, saying they wanted to keep the government closed until after the protests, hoping to show party activists they are pushing back on the Trump administration.\n\nIn criticizing the rallies, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, \"'No Kings' means no paychecks. No paychecks and no government.\"\n\nRead more\n\n– Sarah D. Wire\n\n'Batten down the hatches': White House says more layoffs will come as shutdown drags on\n\nThe White House said Monday that it plans to continue mass layoffs of federal workers as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nThe Office of Management of Budget, in a statement posted on X, said it is “making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.”\n\n“Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the RIFs, and wait,” the OMB, led by director Russell Vought, added in the statement.\n\nThe warning of additional RIFs, or reductions in force, comes after the Trump administration began firing federal workers amid the shutdown last Friday. In all, about 4,000 federal workers were laid off. But a senior administration official told USA TODAY this was just the first wave of terminations, with more to come.\n\nThe layoffs, which unions have challenged in court, gutted the Department of Education, which Trump earlier this year pushed to eliminate entirely by executive order. That includes the elimination of nearly everyone in the department's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.\n\nHow is the shutdown affecting Social Security?\n\nThousands of employees at the Social Security Administration have been furloughed, in turn limiting the agency's available services during the shutdown.\n\nSocial Security and Supplemental Security Income payments are still going out during the shutdown, as they are considered mandatory spending by law and therefore not dependent on congressional approval.\n\nWhile Social Security offices are also still open during the shutdown, some of the agency's services are not available, including replacing a Medicare card, issuing a proof of income letter and updating or correcting earnings records.\n\nSSA was expected to announce the cost-of-living-adjustment for 2026 on Oct. 15, but it has been postponed to Oct. 24 due to a delay in the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' September inflation report.\n\nSenate to vote again, mass firings continue\n\nThe Senate is set to return on Tuesday to vote for an eighth time on reopening the government. The plan is expected to fail again as the impasse continues.\n\nMass firings of federal government workers have been underway across multiple departments, with some of the largest cuts coming to the Treasury Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Education Department.\n\nAccording to a Justice Department court filing, the targets include 1,446 employees and approximately 1,200 employees at the HHS.\n\nAt least 4,000 civil-service workers were notified Oct. 10 they were being laid off, rather than simply furloughed as in past shutdowns, and the administration warned that more are coming.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump vowed to continue paying members of the military.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/07/government-shutdown-day-7-trump-health-care-live-updates/86556653007/", "title": "Government shutdown updates; Will furloughed workers get back pay?", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump continued to up the stakes in his battle with congressional Democrats over the ongoing shutdown, saying some furloughed federal workers “don’t deserve” back pay once the government reopens its doors.\n\nWith no funding deal in sight, a new draft memo circulating in the White House says furloughed workers are not entitled to recoup their missed paychecks, according to an administration official.\n\nThat’s despite Trump signing a 2019 law to provide back pay for furloughed workers after shutdowns, and earlier guidance sent out by his own administration saying the pay would be provided.\n\nThe White House legal analysis is emerging as another point of leverage as Trump and congressional Republicans try to force Democrats to agree to their government funding plan, which is expected to face additional Senate votes after failing five times.\n\nTrump also has threatened mass layoffs and widespread cuts to government programs. His administration is freezing or cutting roughly $26 billion in federal projects for blue states and cities. Layoffs have yet to occur. Trump said Tuesday that they could happen by the end of the week.\n\nTrump promotes crime-fighting as fatal shootings continue\n\nTrump promoted the reduction in crime as he met Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, but the DC police blotter tells a different story.\n\n“There's no crime in DC,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, after he deployed the National Guard to help patrol the city. “Nobody's being shot.”\n\nBut DC’s Metropolitan Police Department is investigating at least three fatal shootings since the federal government shut down Oct. 1, amid other shootings and carjackings. The incidents include:\n\nA shooting Oct. 5 at a home along Minnesota Avenue, where officers found a 33-year-old woman shot dead.\n\nAn Oct. 4 shooting along Clifton Street, where officers found a 26-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound not breathing. A 35-year-old suspect was charged with murder.\n\nAn Oct. 3 shooting along Rhode Island Avenue, where police found a 17-year-old boy suffering a gunshot wound and not breathing.\n\nVirginia candidate rips Trump over withholding back pay threat\n\nVirginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger pounced on Trump’s threat to withhold back pay from federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nSpangberger, who previously represented a northern Virginia district in the House, said federal workers in the state have devoted their careers to caring for seniors, supporting military veterans and keeping Americans safe.\n\n“President Trump is punishing Virginians for his own refusal to work in good faith to end this shutdown,” she said. “Withholding backpay would do nothing to strengthen our country – and would be a further attack on Virginians’ livelihoods.”\n\nVirginia is one of the top states in terms of federal workers, with about 10% of residents employed by the federal government, and that issue has become a hot topic in the race for governor.\n\nRepublican Winsome Earle-Sears, the state’s lieutenant governor, has defended reducing the federal workforce in the past, but she dodged discussing the shutdown's ramifications during a Sept. 30 interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" before Trump and the Democrats failed to reach a deal.\n\nWhite House shifts tariff funds to extend low-income food program: What to know about WIC\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on social media on Tuesday that tariff funds would be used to continue paying for a food-assistance program for low-income families.\n\nThe Women, Infants and Children program was projected to run out of money this week because of the government shutdown, Leavitt said. The program provided about $7.2 billion in aid last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut the administration identified funds from the tariffs on steel and aluminum to keep the resource funded.“The Trump White House will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry because of the Democrats' political games,” Leavitt said.\n\nTrump says some furloughed federal workers ‘don’t deserve’ back pay\n\nTrump said some furloughed federal workers “don’t deserve” to receive back pay during the federal government shutdown.\n\n“It depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump said Tuesday in response to a question from a reporter on back pay. “I can tell you this, the Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about.”\n\nTrump added: “For the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.\"\n\nThe president's remarks come as a new legal analysis from the White House says the 750,000 employees furloughed during the shutdown are not entitled to back pay when they return, an administration official told USA TODAY.\n\nIf the administration chooses to deny federal workers their pay, the White House could use the move as additional pressure for Democrats in Congress to join Republicans to fund the government. Democrats have been withholding their support as they seek policy demands related to health care.\n\nJeffries: 1-year extension of Obamacare subsidies is 'nonstarter'\n\nA one-year extension of Obamacare subsidies is not a viable shutdown off-ramp for Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a nonstarter,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly pushed for a permanent extension of improved health insurance subsidies for low-income families through the Affordable Care Act. The tax credits, which Congress enhanced amid the pandemic, are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\n\"That Democrats are going to go along with a one-year extension from a group of people that just extended permanent tax breaks from their billionaire donors is a laughable proposition,\" Jeffries said. \"Permanent extension, and let's go from there in terms of a negotiation.\"\n\nJohnson questions legality of back pay, but stresses workers should get it\n\nCiting a “new legal analysis,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that some legal analysts believe furloughed federal workers aren’t entitled to back pay.\n\n“If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here,” he said.\n\nHe didn’t specifically say what legal opinion he was referencing, but it came after similar arguments were made in a draft memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nJohnson stressed he hopes federal workers get back pay, and President Trump has told him he feels the same way.\n\nWhite House memo says furloughed workers not entitled to back pay\n\nAs the federal government furloughs thousands of workers amid the government shutdown, a draft memo from the White House says the employees are not entitled to back pay when they return, according to an administration official.\n\nThe threat of withholding pay from federal workers ups the stakes in the showdown between congressional Democrats and the White House and congressional Republicans over funding the government, although it’s not clear if the Trump administration would follow through. Axios first reported on the White House draft memo.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed in the shutdown. Their total daily compensation is around $400 million.\n\nThe U.S. Office of Personnel Management released a memo in September on shutdown furloughs stating workers would get paid.\n\n“After the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were required to perform excepted work during the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those work periods,” the OPM memo states.\n\nA 2019 law signed by Trump states that federal workers who are furloughed during a lapse in government funding “shall be paid for the period of the lapse.” The law states that it applies to any government funding lapse after Dec. 22, 2018.\n\nThe shutdown is playing out in the Virginia governor’s race\n\nTrump’s moves to slash the size of the federal government earlier this year were already a focal point of Virginia’s gubernatorial contest.\n\nThe Old Dominion State has more federal workers than most and Democrats believe those simmering frustrations coupled with the ongoing government shutdown that began Oct. 1 will boil over in their favor as thousands more are now furloughed, which could slow critical services or result in mass firings.\n\n“Our money's kind of on hold. It’s painful,” Chris Witter, 54, a stay-at-home father of two 16-year-old girls whose wife works for the federal government.\n\nHe blamed the shutdown on Republicans, and polling shows most Americans agree.\n\nThe race between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was already an election many view as the first national referendum on Trump's agenda, but the shutdown has sent the race into overdrive.\n\nMTG, ‘not a fan’ of Obamacare, calls for extension of subsidies\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump supporter who calls herself “not a fan” of Obamacare, but she joined Democrats in calling for an extension of federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to keep health insurance costs down.Greene, R-Georgia, said in a social media post Monday that her adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are poised to “DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district,” if the tax credits expire.\n\nSenate Democrats have refused to reopen the government since Oct. 1 by arguing that Medicaid funding cuts should be restored and subsidies for Obamacare extended. Republicans who control Congress contend the Medicaid cuts remove undocumented immigrants and force able-bodied citizens to work for Medicaid benefits. Greene doesn't seek to restore Medicaid cuts.\n\nTrump and GOP congressional leaders say they can negotiate Obamacare subsidies after the government reopens and before the funding expires Dec. 31.\n\n“I’m carving my own lane,” said Greene, who joined Congress in 2021 a decade after lawmakers created Obamacare. “And I’m absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year.”\n\nSchumer disputes Trump's claims about negotiations\n\nTrump did not identify the Democrats who are part of the discussions. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected Trump’s claims that negotiations over health care are taking place between the president and Democrats.\n\n“Trump’s claim isn’t true — but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table,” Schumer said in a statement.\n\nThe senator added: “If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done on healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen.”\n\nTrump hasn't followed through on threats of mass firings\n\nAlthough about 750,000 federal workers have been placed on furloughs during the shutdown, Trump hasn't followed though on his warnings of mass layoffs across the federal workforce.\n\nThe White House last week said layoffs were \"imminent.\" Russell Vought, the White House director of Management and Budget, told Republican lawmakers last Wednesday on Oct. 1 that reductions in force would begin in \"a day or two.\"\n\nBut so far, it’s been all threats and no action.\n\nTrump on Monday said mass layoffs remain on the table. “It could,” Trump said when asked whether another defeat in the Senate of Republicans' funding bill could lead to layoffs. “At some point it will.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/10/10/education-department-firings-employees-shutdown-layoffs/86632531007/", "title": "Education Department lays off roughly 20% of workforce amid ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Education on Oct. 10 laid off over 460 employees, dramatically reducing the workforce of a beleaguered agency that is already struggling to serve students on the heels of massive cuts.\n\nThe number was made public in a court filing the same day from the Justice Department, after the White House delivered on its threat of a fresh wave of firings across the federal workforce.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and other administration officials have indicated the terminations are part of a broader effort to pressure congressional Democrats to end the ongoing government shutdown. Lawmwakers on Capitol Hill, entrenched in a seemingly intractable debate over health care and immigration, have struggled for nearly two weeks to pass any funding bills to turn the lights back on.\n\nThe new departures, which have already been challenged in court, whittled the Education Department's staff by nearly a fifth, based on its most recent headcount estimates of full- and part-time employees.\n\nThe scope of the layoffs is still becoming clear. Workers in several other offices, including those responsible for special education funding and higher education, learned of their terminations late Friday and into the weekend, according to their union.\n\nThe Trump administration first cut the department in half in March through a series of buyouts, layoffs and incentivized retirements. (After a lawsuit, the Supreme Court mostly allowed those firings to proceed while their legality is debated.) Since then, schools have reported widespread disruptions in government services, particularly in programs related to college financial aid, school oversight and civil rights enforcement.\n\nRead more: Colleges report widespread problems with financial aid since Education Department layoffs\n\nThe divisions most impacted included the state and local engagement team at the Office of Communications and Outreach, according to AFGE Local 252, the union representing Education Department workers.\n\nNearly the entirety of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education was laid off, too. Among many responsibilities, that office is in charge of making sure that states annually check to see whether kids are learning subjects like reading and math at grade level.\n\nRachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252 and a former employee who spent years helping student loan borrowers, called the layoffs illegal.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump administration is acting as though they have impunity to cut staff from an already lean, efficient agency,\" she said in a statement. \"In March, the administration fired more than 1,000 critical employees who held statutorily required roles and responsibilities, and for months we have seen department leadership detail staff to cover holes.\"\n\nIn May, Education Secretary Linda McMahon suggested in congressional testimony that the agency's previous layoffs had perhaps gone too far. Within days of the announcement of those firings, the department quietly brought dozens of employees back, USA TODAY previously reported. Since then, even more workers have been hired, public staffing numbers show.\n\n“When you are restructuring a company, you hope that you’re just cutting fat,” McMahon told lawmakers. “Sometimes you cut a little in the muscle, and you realize it as you are continuing your programs, and you can bring people back.”\n\nNearly 90% of the Education Department's staff has also been furloughed due to the shutdown.\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

She said President Donald Trump and his top aides have made several comments showing explicit political motivations for the layoffs, such as Trump saying that cuts would target \"Democrat agencies.\"\n\n\"You can't do that in a nation of laws. And we have laws here, and the things that are being articulated here are not within the law,\" said Illston, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate on Wednesday rejected a GOP-backed spending bill for the ninth time. The legislation would have extended government funding until Nov. 21.\n\nBut Democrats continue to demand additional health care funding to overturn Medicaid cuts and extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe longest previous shutdown lasted 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, during Trump’s first term. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, warned that “we're barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history unless Democrats drop their partisan demands.”\n\nFollow here for the latest updates on the shutdown:\n\nFBI agents will get paychecks during shutdown, director says\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said during a Wednesday White House event that FBI special agents will be paid during the shutdown.\n\nThe announcement comes after Trump said military service members also will continue to receive paychecks.\n\n“We got the people that we want paid paid, and we want the FBI paid, we want the military paid,” Trump told reporters.\n\nThousands of federal workers, including other law enforcement professionals such as the Capitol Police, have begun missing paychecks as the shutdown continues.\n\nAre Social Security payments still going out during shutdown?\n\nYes, Social Security payments, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and benefits for retirement, disability and survivors, continue during a government shutdown.\n\nBecause Social Security benefit programs are considered mandatory spending by law, they are not impacted by the lapse in funding appropriations. Payments are still distributed on a regular schedule during the shutdown.\n\nTrump administration issues warning about SNAP benefits\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture warned that there will not be enough funding to pay the entirety of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for November if the shutdown doesn't end.\n\n\"If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation,\" reads a USSA letter to state agencies dated Oct. 10.\n\nThe letter was signed by SNAP development director Sasha Gersten-Paal and provided to USA TODAY by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nState health officials across the country, including in North Carolina, Wisconsin and Minnesota, have begun warning recipients of the possible lack of funds for November.\n\n– Melina Khan and Mary Walrath-Hodridge\n\nDid the military get paid on Oct. 15? What to know amid shutdown.\n\nAfter two weeks of uncertainty about getting a paycheck during the federal government shutdown, the Department of Defense paid active-duty military members on Wednesday, Oct. 15.\n\nThe division includes roughly 1.2 million active-duty members and National Guard and Reserve members.\n\nThe shutdown entered its 15th day on Oct. 15 with no visible signs of a budget deal between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nService members remained on duty despite the shutdown as their work is deemed essential for national security.\n\n– Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhite House plans to fire more than 10,000 federal workers during shutdown, Vought says\n\nThe Trump administration expects to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers during the government shutdown, according to Russell Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\n“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said on Wednesday in an interview on the “The Charlie Kirk Show,” the podcast of the late conservative activist.\n\nVought also singled out certain government programs that could be cut. “Think of ‘Green New Deal’ programs at the Department of Energy. Think the Minority Business Development Agency at Commerce that divvies up grants on the basis of race. Think environmental justice at EPA,” he said.\n\nThe Trump aide made his comments before a federal judge in California signaled she would likely halt the administration’s layoffs and rule on the side of the plaintiffs in a case brought by labor unions.\n\nThe Trump administration began laying off federal workers amid the shutdown last Friday after repeated threats from Trump. In all, about 4,000 federal workers were fired during this initial wave of layoffs, but the OMB said Monday it will “continue the RIFs,” or reductions in force during the shutdown.\n\n'Democracy' ice sculpture melts in DC\n\nA 3,000-pound ice sculpture of the word \"democracy\" is slowly melting away near the Capitol today.\n\nArtists developed the project for the national Up in Arms campaign, led by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's. They want to draw attention to what they called a \"rise of authoritarianism and militarism at the expense of democracy and the American dream,\" according to a press release from organizers.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nSpeaker Johnson says Trump’s move to pay military is only a ‘temporary fix’\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Trump’s action this week to ensure active-duty military member received their paychecks Wednesday is only a “temporary fix.”\n\nThe Republican speaker warned Democrats the nation’s 1.3 million active-duty troops could miss their next paychecks on Oct. 31 if the government isn’t reopened.\n\n“The executive department’s help is not permanent – it can’t be,” Johnson said at a news conference alongside other House Republicans.\n\n“And if the Democrats continue to vote to keep the government closed, as they have done so now so many times, then we know that U.S. troops are going to risk missing a full paycheck at the end of this month,” he added.\n\nWith military members at risk of losing Wednesday’s paychecks, Trump over the weekend announced he directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use “all available funds” to ensure troops were paid. The administration had the Pentagon tweak its budget to ensure troops were paid, while other government employees who perform critical services have worked without pay during the shutdown.\n\n7 things to watch for signs of a shutdown end\n\nThere are many questions about how to get out of the seemingly intractable government shutdown. But there's no clear answer.\n\nAt some point, a number of variables in the shutdown equation could start to change, possibly creating a path for enough lawmaker votes to reopen the government. Federal workforce layoffs may worsen, as the White House has threatened. Bipartisan back-channeling among senators could turn up a compromise on the biggest sticking points.\n\nHere are seven things to keep an eye on:\n\nPossible breakthroughs in Obamacare negotiations What Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is saying What moderate and retiring Democrats are saying What President Trump is saying Federal layoffs worsening Potential disruptions in military pay The overall pain the shutdown is causing Americans\n\nRead more here: 7 things to watch for signs the government shutdown will end\n\nSpeaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries agree to shutdown debate on C-SPAN\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries have agreed to appear together on C-SPAN to debate the federal government shutdown.\n\nThe network singled out their commitments in a press statement that pointed to recent public statements from both Johnson and Jeffries.\n\nNo date has been set for a joint appearance. According to C-SPAN, the respective leaders have agreed to jointly appear on C-SPAN’s new show “Ceasefire,” hosted by Politico Washington Bureau Chief Dasha Burns.\n\n“I’ll sit down with Hakeem Jeffries, my counterpart. I’d love to,” Johnson told C-SPAN on Oct. 9, when the speaker fielded questions about the shutdown from callers during a solo appearance on C-SPAN.\n\nJeffries on Tuesday told reporters that he accepts Johnson’s challenge and looks forward to debating him. “We’re going to try to get it scheduled, absolutely,” Jeffries told a group of reporters, according to The Hill.\n\nCantwell calls for investigation of DHS shutdown videos at airports\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the transportation committee, demanded an investigation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for providing what she called “partisan video” about the shutdown to airports across the country.\n\nCantwell of Washington alleged a violation of the Hatch Act, which limits political activities by federal employees. She urged Jamieson Greer, who serves as acting head of the Office of Special Counsel, to investigate the video playing at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints that blames “Democrats in Congress” for the government shutdown and for TSA employees “working without pay.”\n\n“This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act,” Cantwell wrote in a letter to Greer.\n\nAssistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said “it is a simple statement of fact that Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”\n\n“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” McLaughlin added.\n\nAt least six airports refused to play the video in Charlotte, North Carolina; Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Indianapolis, Indiana and Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nSenate moves forward with full-year defense spending bill\n\nWith the shutdown dragging on, congressional Republicans are trying something new to attempt to fund parts of the government.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, has slated a procedural vote Thursday for a full-year defense spending bill. It's part of a fresh strategy to force Democrats, who largely want to see the bipartisan appropriations process continue on pace, into an awkward position.\n\nCongress often keeps the government open by passing short-term funding measures, something Thune has said he wants to change, and for which there's bipartisan support. Even as the shutdown has continued, rank-and-file lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been working to draft full-year appropriations bills.\n\nAsked Wednesday about whether any larger off-ramp to the shutdown is in the works, Thune told reporters it's possible, but said he expects Democrats to hold out until at least after this Saturday, Oct. 18, when historic turnout is expected for nationwide protests against the Trump administration.\n\nGovernment shutdown could cost US economy $15 billion a day, Bessent says\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the federal government shutdown could soon cost the United States economy $15 billion a day as he called for moderate Senate Democrats to “be heroes” by joining Republicans to reopen the government.\n\n“Be heroes,” Bessent said at a Wednesday morning news conference. “Break away from the hive of radicalism and do something for the American people because we are starting to cut into muscle here.”\n\nRepublicans control the House, Senate and White House. But Republicans need 60 votes in the Senate to avoid a filibuster to pass a funding bill – something they’ve been unable to achieve in multiple votes on a bill to fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\nBessent accused “the mainstream media” of not focusing on Democrats “the way they would have if the Republicans were willing to keep the government closed.”\n\nDemocrats have demanded the reversal of Republicans’ recent cuts to Medicaid and the extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies be included in any funding measure.\n\nEchoing other Republicans, Bessent suggested Democrats want to keep the government closed through the upcoming nationwide “No Kings” protest, set for Oct. 18\n\n“I believe that the Democrats will come to their senses soon,” Bessent said. “Maybe it’s after this ‘No Kings’ thing. But ‘No Kings’ equal no paychecks.”\n\nCapitol Police miss paycheck amid shutdown\n\nAs congressional leaders continue their standoff over legislation to fund the government, the federal workers protecting them are going without pay.\n\nThe head of the Capitol Police Union called on lawmakers to end the shutdown in an Oct. 14 statement that notes officers missed their first full paychecks Oct. 10.\n\n“The longer the shutdown drags on, the harder it becomes for my officers,” Capitol Police Union Chairman Gus Papathanasiou said in a statement. “Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass because we are in shutdown – they still expect to be paid.”\n\nMilitary service members also were set to miss a paycheck on Oct. 15, but Trump said on Oct. 11 that he authorized the Department of Defense to tap “identified funds” for military pay.\n\nSenate to vote again at 2:15 p.m. to reopen the government\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, set up the 10th vote to approve House legislation that would reopen the government until Nov. 21 but without any hope of passage.\n\nThe last vote Oct. 14 failed 49-45 with six senators absent. Three senators who caucus with Democrats have joined Republicans in voting to end the shutdown but they need another five to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to cut off debate.\n\nGOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has opposed the measure.\n\nTrump to release list of programs closed in shutdown\n\nTrump said he would release a list Oct. 17 of programs he has eliminated as part of the continuing shutdown.\n\n“We are closing up Democrat programs that we disagree with and they’re never going to open up again,” Trump said.\n\nTrump argued Democrats are suffering under the shutdown because he is able to lay off workers and eliminate programs that would otherwise continue.\n\n“We’re able to do things that we’ve never been able to do before,” Trump said. “The Democrats are getting killed.”\n\nOMB prepares to 'ride out the Democrats' intransigence'\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget announced Oct. 14 on social media it was preparing for more layoffs.\n\n“OMB is making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats’ intransigence,” the post said. “Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the RIFs, and wait.”\n\nJeffries: Democrats committed to fixing GOP 'health care crisis'\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, told reporters Oct. 14 that congressional Democrats “remain committed to finding a bipartisan path forward.”\n\n“To reopen the government, enact a spending agreement that actually meets the needs of the American people and addresses the Republican health care crisis,” Jeffries said.\n\nJohnson on Democrats: 'They're playing a game'\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, told reporters Oct. 14 he has nothing to negotiate because Republicans put no special policy provisions in the legislation to reopen the government until Nov. 21. He said negotiations over health care costs could be held after the government reopens.\n\n“I don’t have anything that I can take off that document and make it more palatable,\" Johnson said. “We’re not playing games. They’re playing a game.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/06/government-shutdown-trump-congress-senate-vote/86456492007/", "title": "Government shutdown updates; Senate vote fails; layoffs loom", "text": "Senators on Monday failed to strike a funding deal for the fifth time – guaranteeing that the government shutdown will drag on even longer.\n\nThe Senate again shot down dueling bills authored by Republicans and Democrats. There's still no surefire end in sight to the fiscal crisis, which has shuttered a swath of federal agencies and services across the country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump over the weekend continued to blame Democrats for Congress' failure to reach a funding agreement, bringing up the topic during an event honoring the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Navy. The two-term Republican assured service members who are currently working without pay that they would get checks soon and even promised \"across-the-board\" raises.\n\nBack on Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, accused Republicans of shutting down the government rather than supporting health care for \"hardworking American taxpayers.\" As a condition for their much-needed Senate votes to fund the federal government, Democrats are pushing Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nPay has been suspended for roughly 2 million federal workers, and about 750,000 workers remain on furlough following the Oct. 1 funding lapse. Other workers considered essential to public safety and national security, such as troops and air traffic control workers, are still required to work without pay.\n\nThe Trump administration has already reduced the federal workforce by more than 200,000 employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nThe Senate will consider the bills again this week. The House of Representatives isn't scheduled to return until Oct. 14, nearly two months since lawmakers in that chamber last voted.\n\n'Very good things could happen': Trump talks health care with Democrats\n\nTrump said he and congressional Republicans are talking with Democrats about how to improve health care, but layoffs are still possible if the government shutdown continues.\n\nMost Senate Democrats have refused to help Republicans reopen the government since Oct. 1 because of concerns about Medicaid cuts and the expiration of federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans have opposed Democratic demands to overturn Medicaid cuts approved earlier in the year or to extend Obamacare subsidies for a combined estimate of more than $1 trillion over a decade. Trump on Monday refused to detail what options he was discussing with Democrats.\n\n“We’re talking to them,” Trump said. “Some very good things could happen with respect to health care.”\n\nWith the Senate set to vote again tomorrow on a House GOP bill that would extend government funding, Trump said another failed vote could lead to layoffs instead of traditional furloughs.\n\n“It could,” Trump said. “At some point it will.”\n\nAre federal credit unions open during the government shutdown?\n\nWhen paychecks stop coming, furloughed employees can still lean on their federal credit unions for help during the government shutdown, the National Credit Union Administration said.\n\nSince NCUA is funded by credit unions, not congressional appropriations, all of the institutions remain open during a government shutdown. Branches located inside government buildings, however, may be affected, NCUA warned.\n\nNot only can members continue banking during the congressional impasse, but they may find special targeted programs for federal employees. Many are offering short-term loans, fee and penalty waivers, payment deferrals and more to help workers bridge the gap.\n\n\"We have been through government shutdowns before and truly understand the financial challenges our members face,\" said Brett Noll, president and chief executive at the 90-year-old FedChoice credit union. \"That’s why we, and many other credit unions, immediately activated support measures from day one of the shutdown.\"\n\n– Medora Lee\n\nHow is the IRS impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will not immediately be impacted by the government shutdown. More than 74,000 IRS employees are expected to report to work amid the funding crisis, per the IRS' government shutdown contingency plan.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nCan I still get a passport with the government shutdown?\n\nPassport services will also remain operational but could be delayed in the case of a prolonged shutdown, and access to in-person passport services in some government buildings could be limited.\n\n– Margie Cullen\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans? What about FAFSA?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, borrowers are still required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department’s contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department would cease any new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department. That's because it's furloughing the majority of its staff.\n\nExperts say while most borrowers won’t “feel” a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nTransportation secretary warns of air traffic controller sick calls\n\nIn a press conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on Monday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the shutdown was already putting extra strain on air traffic controllers.\n\nAlthough he said the nation's airspace remains safe, he noted that some air traffic control facilities were experiencing an uptick in sick calls – with some missing as many as 50% of employees on any given day. He said that could result in flight delays and cancelations as the FAA limits capacity through some sectors of the airspace.\n\nDuffy also said a prolonged shutdown could have longer-term impacts on air traffic controller training because some of the support staff at the agency could be laid off. He added that the Essential Air Service, which brings flights to underserved rural communities, will run out funding on Oct. 12 if the shutdown continues.\n\nThe DOT does not oversee the TSA, which is under the Department of Homeland Security, but that agency, too, is preparing for issues if the shutdown drags on.\n\nLayoffs haven’t begun, but continue to loom: White House\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that threatened layoffs from the shutdown haven’t begun but continue to loom.\n\nLeavitt said the Office of Management and Budget is reviewing layoff plans with federal agencies. Asked whether layoffs would follow another failed Senate vote on Monday, Leavitt refused to say when layoffs would begin.\n\n“We don’t want to see people laid off,” Leavitt said. “Layoffs will be an unfortunate consequence” of the shutdown.\n\nSmithsonian to remain open through Saturday\n\nThe Smithsonian Institute’s museums and zoo will remain open through Saturday, Oct. 11 if the government shutdown continues.\n\nThe Smithsonian announced the extension on its website. If the shutdown continues past Saturday, the facilities will close to the public, the announcement said.\n\nThe Smithsonian was previously scheduled to stay open through at least Monday, using money from the previous fiscal year’s budget.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nJohnson prays for a handful more Senate Democrats to reopen government\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated his arguments against the shutdown for reporters Monday in imploring Senate Democrats to reopen the government.\n\nJohnson, R-Louisiana, said he assured Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, that the House would continue working on full-year spending bills and subsidies for the Affordable Care Act once the government reopens.\n\nThe GOP holds a 53-47 Senate majority, but 60 votes are needed to advance legislation. So far only three Democrats have joined Republicans, and another five are needed to advance House legislation to reopen the government until Nov. 21, to give time for full-year bills to be debated.\n\n“It’s shameless. It is sad. Real people are hurting. It needs to end,” Johnson said, ahead of another vote at 5:30 p.m. “I sure pray and I hope you all will that a handful of additional common-sense people on the Democrat side will change their votes.”\n\nJohnson said no need to ‘waste time’ debating Jeffries\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday that he didn’t need the “theatrics” of debating Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries about the shutdown because the House already approved legislation to reopen the government.\n\nJohnson, R-Louisiana, said Jeffries was making a “desperate plea for attention” because polls showed only 13% support for the New York Democrat’s position.\n\n“I’m not going to let Hakeem try to pretend for these theatrics,” Johnson said. “We don’t need to waste time on that nonsense.”\n\nTSA is still screening passengers during the shutdown without pay\n\nAs the government shutdown stretches into its second week, travelers may begin to worry about how it could affect their airport experience.\n\nFor now, impacts remain minimal — TSA and FAA employees are still on the job, working without pay to keep flights running smoothly.\n\nOver the weekend, airport lines were typical, and flight cancellations stayed low, according to FlightAware. But if the shutdown continues, experts warn that missed paychecks could lead to staffing shortages and longer wait times at security checkpoints.\n\nTSA has asked passengers for patience as it screens roughly 2.5 million travelers per day nationwide.\n\nJeffries challenges Speaker Johnson to House floor shutdown debate\n\nDemocratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries challenged House Speaker Mike Johnson to a debate over the government shutdown on the House floor.\n\n“Given the urgency of the moment and the Republican refusal to negotiate a bipartisan agreement, a debate on the House Floor will provide the American people with the transparency they deserve,” Jeffries, D-New York, wrote Monday to Johnson. “It will also give you an opportunity to explain your my way or the highway approach to shutting the government down, when Democratic votes are needed to resolve the impasse that exists.”\n\nThe House remains in recess this week after Johnson postponed the next votes until Oct. 13. The move had the effect of leaving in the Senate’s hands the legislation that House Republicans already passed to reopen the government until Nov. 21.\n\nWhite House posts Jeffries sombrero video as shutdown drags on\n\nThe White House is starting the week by again trolling Democrats over the shutdown, posting an apparently AI-generated video of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wearing a sombrero, which the Democrat has blasted as “racist.”\n\n“Starting another week of the DEMOCRAT SHUTDOWN,” the White House wrote on social media in sharing the video Monday.\n\nThe video shows Jeffries with a Mexican sombrero hat, a mustache and mariachi music playing in the background as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stands next to him.\n\n\"There's no way to sugarcoat it, nobody likes Democrats anymore,” Schumer's fake voice says, adding: \"Not even Black people wanna vote for us anymore, even Latinos hate us.”\n\nAfter Jeffries called an earlier version of the video racist, Vice President JD Vance said Trump was just having fun. The White House played the video on a loop in the press briefing room on Oct. 1.\n\n\"I think it's funny, the president's joking,\" Vance said, adding: \"I'll tell Hakeem Jeffries right now. I make this solemn promise to you that if you help us reopen the government, the sombrero memes will stop.\"\n\nWho do Americans blame for the government shutdown?\n\nMore Americans blame Trump and congressional Republicans for the government shutdown than congressional Democrats, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey.\n\nThe poll found that 39% of U.S. adults believe Trump and the GOP deserve the most blame, while 30% blame Democrats more and 31% blame both equally.\n\nA majority – 52% - disapprove of how Trump and Republicans are handling the shutdown, while 49% disapprove of Democrats.\n\nJust 23% believe the GOP’s position is worth a shutdown, and 28% say Democrats’ demands are worth shuttering the government.\n\nThe survey of 2,441 adults was taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 on the first three days of the shutdown.\n\nFederal workers soon will miss first paycheck\n\nFederal workers will begin missing paychecks this week as the government shutdown continues.\n\nCivilian workers who receive their checks electronically are set to be paid Oct. 10, according to the General Services Administration. The next pay day for military members is Oct. 15, according to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service.\n\nPressure could build to fund the government as workers go without pay.\n\nWhat is President Trump's schedule today?\n\nTrump has no public events on his Monday schedule.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding at a media briefing at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat happens to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?\n\nThe Social Security Administration will continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, but will furlough 12% of its staff and pause marketing campaigns, according to the agency’s shutdown plan.\n\nPayments will likewise continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.\n\nWhat is the economic impact of a government shutdown?\n\nThe Congressional Research Service estimated that the partial shutdown in 2018-2019 resulted in a $3 billion loss to the real gross domestic product. In addition, consumer spending went down, impacting private sector businesses and profits.\n\nThe shutdown will also delayed the release of the September jobs report and potentially the release of other key economic data this month.\n\n“Markets and policymakers have been looking for evidence of whether the labor market was continuing to cool gradually, or whether the slowdown was sharper than expected,” said Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement to USA TODAY. “This fresh gap in knowledge is significant at a time when clarity matters most.\"\n\nWill a government shutdown impact my flight?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work.\n\nHowever, a group representing major U.S. airlines warned a partial federal government shutdown could strain American aviation and slow flights, as air traffic controllers and security officers would be forced to work without pay and other functions would be halted.\n\nAirline trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned that if funding lapses \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency\" and impacting travelers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/11/trump-fires-federal-workers-government-shutdown-live-updates/86626716007/", "title": "Trump says the military will get paid during shutdown.", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration made good on a threat to fire thousands of federal workers, with agencies sending \"reduction in force\" notifications to federal workers heading into the weekend.\n\nTrump had threatened mass firings for almost two weeks, if Democrats did not agree to his terms to fund the government, when his administration pulled the trigger on the eleventh day of the federal shutdown.\n\nThe president said the layoffs hit \"Democrat-oriented\" areas of the government, without saying how many people had been fired.\n\n\"It will be a lot of people, all because of the Democrats,\" Trump told reporters on Oct. 10 in the Oval Office, as he tried to pin the blame for the shutdown on the opposing political party.\n\nThe Trump administration said about 4,000 federal workers had so far received RIF notices. The figure was detailed in a court document the Justice Department submitted in response to a lawsuit from unions representing government workers. But additional layoffs are coming, a senior administration official told USA TODAY.\n\nThe firings came under criticism from Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who is up for reelection next year.\n\n\"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,\" Collins said in a statement. \"Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.”\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY for live updates.\n\n'Pay our troops’ Trump says he’s found money for the military\n\nPresident Donald Trump says his administration has sniffed out a way to get military service members their upcoming check during the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n“We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary (Pete) Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS,” Trump said in an Oct. 11 post on Truth Social.\n\nIf successful the maneuver could shift some of the focus in the messaging war between the White House and congressional Democrats, as the president looks to apply pressure to end the stalemate.\n\nTrump asserted that paying the service members on Oct. 15 is paramount and that he won’t “allow the Democrats to hold our military, and the entire security of our nation, hostage.” He said the Democrats should allow the government to reopen.\n\nBut Democrats maintain they are opposing the Republican-sponsored spending plan because it cuts healthcare subsidies for millions. Some have sought to pressure Trump by spotlighting Qatar receiving a military base in Idaho and awarding Argentina a $20 billion currency swap during the shutdown.\n\n“(Four) million Americans will lose health care if Republicans get their way,” Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona, a rumored 2028 presidential candidate who is among the opposition, said in an Oct. 11 post on X.\n\n“That means people will go bankrupt paying for chemotherapy. That’s on them.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nEducation Department wipes out special education office\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education fired nearly everyone in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in a wave of new layoffs that began Friday, according to the union representing the agency's employees.\n\nIt was unclear how many people in the division were fired, but most staffers below the leadership level were part of the workforce reduction, said Rachel Gittleman, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. Separately, employees involved in the college access program known as TRIO were also affected, she said.\n\nThe firings \"double down on the harm to K-12 students and schools across the country,\" Gittleman told USA TODAY.\n\nSpokespeople for the Education Department did not respond to requests for comment Saturday.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon has said on multiple occasions that safeguarding students with disabilities, and making sure they have access to the educational resources they're legally entitled to, is a top priority.\n\n-Zachary Schermele\n\nWho Trump is firing amid the shutdown\n\nNonessential federal workers have historically been placed on furloughs that pause their pay during government shutdowns rather than being hit with firings.\n\nBut Trump is seeking to apply maximum pressure on Democrats as the firings appear to target areas that the president has criticized in the past.\n\n“These are largely people that the Democrats want,” Trump said this week. \"Many of them will be fired.\"\n\nAt least seven departments are seeing slashes, according to court documents, including 176 workers in the Department of Homeland Security; 187 in the Energy Department; 315 in the Commerce Department; 442 in the Department of Housing and Urban Development; 466 in the Education Department; roughly 1,200 in the Department of Health and Human Services; and 1,446 in the Treasury Department.\n\nSome agencies are being hit harder than others, for example, nearly the entirety of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education was laid off.\n\nFederal union leaders contend the firings are illegal and plan to challenge them in court as Democratic leaders dig in their heels and focus their messaging on restoring Obamacare subsidies.\n\n“Donald Trump is back on the golf course,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in an Oct. 11 post on X. “House Republicans have cancelled votes for a third straight week. And Democrats are continuing the fight to protect your healthcare.”\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhy did the U.S. government shut down?\n\nDemocrats and Republicans cannot agree on passing a bill funding government services through October, resulting in a shutdown.\n\nBut the specific reason for the 11-day deadlock is a battle over federal subsidies for health insurance.\n\nProgressive lawmakers want to restore Medicaid funding towards the Affordable Care Act − often called Obamacare – that were cut by Trump's \"one big, beautiful\" legislative package. It is estimated 7.5 million people could go without health insurance as a result.\n\nThe Trump administration argues Democrats are seeking to give those resources to undocumented immigrants, but as USA TODAY has reported, it's a bit more complicated than how the president and his allies are presenting the situation.\n\nEven though the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, in the Senate they are consistently coming up short of the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster and get their spending proposal to Trump’s desk, which gives Democrats an upper hand in the negotiations.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSenate math remains stagnant\n\nThings are getting testy on Capitol Hill as lawmakers cannot seem to find a compromise on opening the federal government back up as they feel pressure from angry Americans back home.\n\nThe Senate has tried at least a half dozen times to get the measure through since the shutdown happened, but its members cannot reach the needed 60-vote threshold.\n\nDemocratic Sens. John Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, and Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, along with independent Angus King, of Maine, have joined the GOP caucus. But with Republican Sen. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, siding against the measure, they still need five more Democrats to defect on a short-term spending bill.\n\nThese are the retiring or moderate Democrats to watch.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nPolls: Most Americans blame Trump, GOP – for now\n\nBoth sides are making their case to the American public, and at the moment voters are mostly saying the shutdown is the fault of Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll conducted Oct. 4-6, for example, found 41% of U.S. adults think the president and GOP are responsible, versus 30% who said the same about Democrats.\n\nAnother 23% say both parties are equally responsible, according to the survey, but that could change as the impact of the shutdown spreads.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration, for instance, announced earlier this week it was understaffed at two locations in New Jersey and New Mexico causing some flight delays; military families are starting to lash out at lawmakers over the likelihood of missed paychecks amid reports of growing lines at food pantries and cancellation of children services for their children; and Native American communities are leaning on their tribal nation' reserves after being disproportionately impacted when the Bureau of Indian Affairs placed over 1,100 employees on furlough on the shutdown's first day.\n\nIf the shutdown continues – Polymarket bettors give it between 10 to 29 days, for instance – then the polling could shift significantly and that may reshuffle the political math in Congress.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSenate Republican floats ‘nuclear option’ to end shutdown\n\nAs President Trump begins mass layoffs in response to the shutdown, some Republicans lawmakers are suggesting the Senate bypass the 60-vote rule and reopen the government without Democratic help.\n\n“Let’s make this a Republican-only vote,” Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said during an Oct. 8 appearance on Fox News.\n\nThe filibuster, he added, allows the minority party to hold the majority \"hostage\" and the GOP should use a simple majority vote to break the logjam. It’s an idea Trump himself floated back in 2018 when a shutdown hit his first crack at the presidency.\n\nBut just as Republican leadership back then had cautioned against evoking the so-called “nuclear option” Senate Majority Leader John Thune affirmed this week that the upper chamber isn’t interested.\n\n“There’s always a lot of swirl out there, as you know, from social media, etcetera, but no, I have not had that conversation with the president,” the South Dakota senator said when asked about the idea.\n\nOther Republicans have thrown cold water on it, too, mainly arguing that the same lever could be used against them by a Democratic majority in the future.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhen will Congress vote next?\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson cancelled plans for the House to convene on Oct. 13 and did not set a date for members to return.\n\nThe Senate is out until Oct. 14. In the evening, senators will take another government funding vote. It will be their eighth time taking up legislation. For the bill that Republicans have been putting forward to pass, five additional Democrats would need to cross party lines to support it.\n\nHow long will the shutdown last?\n\nA breakthrough in shutdown negotiations between Republicans and Democrats to fund the government appeared increasingly unlikely before next Tuesday, with the Senate in recess until then.\n\nTrump is expected to depart on Oct. 12 for Israel and Egypt. He's not expected to return until Oct. 14.\n\nSmithsonian museums, National Zoo to close temporarily\n\nSmithsonian museums – including the National Zoo – are set to temporarily close on Oct. 12,\n\nSocial media will not be updated during the closure other than to provide updates on the status of operations, a statement posted to X said.\n\nThe Smithsonian operates the zoon and a complex of 17 museums in the Washington, D.C. area and two in New York City.\n\nThe closure means the National Zoo's beloved giant panda cam will not be in operation until the shutdown ends. The staff who run the live animal feeds are considered nonessential, the zoo's website says. The animals will still be cared for and fed.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/09/government-shutdown-day-9-trump-military-pay-live-updates/86551180007/", "title": "Government shutdown latest; Senate votes, military pay fight", "text": "Editor's note: To read the latest on the government shutdown, click here for Friday's coverage.\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ President Donald Trump met with his Cabinet on Thursday as the government shutdown dragged on, and the Senate again rejected two deals that could have ended the funding fight.\n\nThe Cabinet meeting offered an opportunity for department chiefs to describe how the shutdown is hurting Americans who rely on government services. And Trump pressured Democratic lawmakers who are demanding concessions on health care in exchange for their votes.\n\n\"We're going to be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way this works,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic and Republican-backed spending bills failed in the Senate – for the seventh time. Most Senate Democrats pushed for the same health care reforms in their package, while the GOP-backed legislation would have temporarily kept government funding going until Nov. 21.\n\nTrump has doubled down on threats to block some furloughed federal workers from receiving back pay once this shutdown is over, claiming some \"won't qualify.\" The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday announced furloughs for 34,000 employees, nearly half of its staff, adding to the some 750,000 furloughed workers across the government.\n\nYet Trump insisted members of the military don't need to worry about missing their next paychecks as he signaled support for stand-alone legislation to ensure they are paid during the shutdown.\n\nStocks fall Thursday after notching record highs\n\nU.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, marking only the second down day for Wall Street since the government shutdown began nine days ago.\n\nThe broad S&P 500 closed at 6,735.11, down about 19 points or .3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 243 points, or 0.5%, to settle at 46,358.42. The Nasdaq Composite index, which is weighted heavily toward technology companies, gave back 19 points, or 0.1%, ending the session at 3,024.63.\n\nMost previous shutdowns haven’t been bad for stocks, wrote Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist for LPL Financial, in a research note released on Oct. 1.\n\n\"Investors have generally looked past budget-related disruptions, prioritizing corporate earnings, broader economic trends, and other key macroeconomic factors,\" Turnquist said. The longest previous shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019. During that period, the S&P 500 rallied just over 10% because the Federal Reserve hinted it would hold off on additional rate rises.\n\nThe down day on Thursday may be as much a sign of investors taking profits as anything else. The S&P 500 has closed at fresh highs each day for much of the past week.\n\n– Andrea Riquier\n\nTrump urges people to call Democratic lawmakers to end shutdown\n\nTrump blamed Democrats for the shutdown when asked in the Oval Office what his message would be to families facing missed paychecks or layoffs.\n\n\"My message is call your local representative, congressman or senator, and tell them to get on the ball,\" Trump said.\n\nFederal civil workers will get smaller paychecks Oct. 10 because of the shutdown that began Oct. 1. Members of the military will miss a paycheck Oct. 15.\n\nDemocrats accuse Trump of 'gutting essential public services'\n\nDemocratic lawmakers accused Trump of \"gutting essential public services\" and serving as \"half a president\" after he threatened to permanently eliminate \"Democrat programs\" during the shutdown.\n\n\"Let me say that again: Trump wants to hurt Americans – by gutting essential public services – so that Democrats will give up their fight for Americans' health care,\" Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, said on social media. \"We’re not giving up.\"\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-California, said on social media that Trump was demonstrating his interest in being \"half a president\" and dividing, not uniting.\n\nWhat happens to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid during a shutdown?\n\nThe Social Security Administration will continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, but will furlough 12% of its staff and pause marketing campaigns, according to the agency’s shutdown plan.\n\nPayments will likewise continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.\n\nAre federal credit unions open during the government shutdown?\n\nWhen paychecks stop coming, furloughed employees can still lean on their federal credit unions for help during the government shutdown, the National Credit Union Administration said.\n\nSince NCUA is funded by credit unions, not congressional appropriations, all of the institutions remain open during a government shutdown. Branches located inside government buildings, however, may be affected, NCUA warned.\n\nNot only can members continue banking during the congressional impasse, but they may find special targeted programs for federal employees. Many are offering short-term loans, fee and penalty waivers, payment deferrals and more to help workers bridge the gap.\n\n\"We have been through government shutdowns before and truly understand the financial challenges our members face,\" said Brett Noll, president and chief executive at the 90-year-old FedChoice credit union. \"That’s why we, and many other credit unions, immediately activated support measures from day one of the shutdown.\"\n\n– Medora Lee\n\nAre national parks open or closed? Here's the status of the most popular NPS sites\n\nThough operations of \"non-essential\" government agencies, including the National Park Service, have been put on an indefinite hold, visitor access to the country's 63 national parks have not yet been impacted by the shutdown.\n\nBut some services – such as the South Rim Visitor Center at Grand Canyon – may be limited or unavailable to the public until a funding package is passed.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nSenate bills fail for seventh time\n\nTwo funding measures that could potentially reopen the government failed once more in the Senate on Thursday.\n\nIt's the seventh time the bills have been shot down. The votes largely remained unchanged, with a few Democrats defecting to support a seven-week funding extension backed by the GOP. All Republicans once again blocked the Democrats' proposal, which would permanently extend expiring Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts.\n\nMoney to oversee nation’s nuclear stockpile about to run out, Energy secretary says\n\nSecretary of Energy Chris Wright said the agency overseeing the nation’s nuclear stockpile is quickly running out of money because of the government shutdown.\n\nWright said the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains the safety and security of the nation’s nuclear stockpile, is on track to run out of funding in about a week.\n\n\"In six or seven days, we’re going to run out of funding, and the retooling of our nuclear stockpile – the ultimate guarantor of our sovereignty – is going to be underfunded and we’re going to have to slow down and creep to crawl these efforts,\" Wright told Trump at a Thursday Cabinet meeting.\n\nIn March, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency fired dozens of employees at the NNSA – and then quickly worked to bring them back – as part of efforts to cut spending across the government.\n\nTrump continued to blame Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer for keeping the government shut after Senate Democrats for the sixth time on Wednesday blocked a Republican-backed bill to fund the government through Nov. 21.\n\nTrump again threatens ‘permanent’ cuts in Democratic programs\n\nTrump threatened again during his Cabinet meeting to make permanent cuts during the shutdown to programs favored by Democrats and opposed by Republicans.\n\n\"We're going to be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way this works,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.\"\n\nTrump promotes lower prescription prices in healthcare debate\n\nTrump complained about Democrats focusing on healthcare in the shutdown because he argued Republicans have become the party of improving healthcare.\n\nTrump cited a recent agreement with Pfizer to sell drugs in the U.S. for the same prices as industrialized countries overseas, rather than offering discounts abroad.\n\n\"Basically, we subsidized the world,\" Trump said. \"This is going to have a huge positive impact on Medicare, Medicaid, even Social Security – anything where there’s pharmaceuticals, drugs involved.\"\n\nTrump said Democrats keep using healthcare costs \"as a cudgel.\"\n\nFederal deficit holds about steady: CBO\n\nThe federal budget deficit was $1.8 trillion for the year that ended Sept. 30, about the same as the previous year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nRevenues increased $308 billion, benefitting from a rise in customs duties and individuals paying more income taxes but partially offset by reduced corporate taxes, according to CBO. Spending rose about $301 billion, mostly from the largest benefit programs and from rising interest on the national debt.\n\nThe deficit was $8 billion less than the shortfall recorded in the previous fiscal year, according to CBO.\n\nSenate to vote on funding bills... again\n\nIt's starting to feel like Groundhog Day in the United States Senate.\n\nSenators will vote again on Thursday morning for the seventh time on dueling funding measures to reopen the government. With both sides still dug in on their respective positions, neither bill is expected to pass.\n\nTSA wait times normal so far\n\nIn a social media post on Oct. 9, the Transportation Security Administration said that wait times at its airport checkpoints across the nation have been normal during the shutdown.\n\n\"Yesterday, TSA screened about 2.4M individuals (+ 14.9% YoY). The average wait time in standard was 6.28 minutes, while the average TSA PreCheck wait time was 2.65 minutes,\" the post said.\n\nTSA officers are considered essential workers and continue to show up even as they risk missing paychecks as the shutdown drags on.\n\nThe agency previously warned that a prolonged shutdown could lead to increased wait times at some airports as security officers feel the pinch from the funding freeze.\n\n\"An extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports. We kindly ask for our passengers’ patience during this time,\" a previous social media post from the agency said.\n\nFederal employees should expect smaller paycheck\n\nFederal employees should expect a smaller paycheck on Friday, Oct. 10, the first payday since the partial government shutdown began on Oct. 1.\n\nAlthough federal workers do not get paid during a government shutdown, the Oct. 10 check covers work performed between Sept. 21 and Oct. 4, which includes the first three days of the shutdown. Meaning, employees will get paid for hours worked from Sept. 21 to Oct. 1.\n\nUnder the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, federal workers should receive retroactive pay after the shutdown ends for any hours logged during the lapse. However, Trump said on Oct. 7 that some furloughed federal workers \"don’t deserve\" to receive back pay once the shutdown ends.\n\n– Melina Khan\n\nMilitary wife confronts Johnson on C-SPAN\n\nSpeaker Johnson dealt with a rotation of unhappy callers in a C-SPAN interview Thursday morning.\n\nIn one particularly dramatic exchange, a military wife from Virginia pleaded with him to reopen the government or pass funding so her family doesn’t miss a paycheck on Oct. 15.\n\nUnless Congress acts to make sure troops get paid, she said her two kids with severe medical conditions \"could die.\"\n\n\"As a Republican, I'm very disappointed in my party, and I'm very disappointed in you, because you have the power to call the House back,\" she said. \"You refuse to do that, just for a show.\"\n\nJohnson said situations like hers keep him up at night. He said the House already tried to vote to pay the troops when it passed a short-term government funding extension that has since failed in the Senate many times.\n\n\"The Democrats are the ones that are preventing you from getting a check,\" he said.\n\nBill to pay military during shutdown gathers steam\n\nRep. Jennifer Kiggans, who proposed legislation to pay members of the military despite the shutdown, urged fellow House GOP leadership Oct. 8 to swiftly pass her bill, even though the House is not in session while the Senate debates how to reopen the government.\n\n\"Our servicemembers should never have to worry about missing a paycheck because Washington can’t do its job,\" Kiggans, R-Virginia, said in a statement when introducing her bill Sept. 16.\n\nShe has 148 mostly Republican co-sponsors and got an important ally when the Republican who oversees military spending on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Ken Calvert of California, signed on Oct. 8.The next payday 1.3 million members of the military will miss is Oct. 15.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has said the chamber doesn’t have to vote again because it already approved an extension of all government funding through Nov. 21.\n\nTrump supported paying the troops but said the shutdown could be resolved before the military misses its payday.\n\n\"You know what one week is for me? An eternity,\" Trump told reporters Oct. 8. \"One week for me is a long time. We’ll take care of it.\"\n\nVoters heap shutdown blame on all sides in new survey\n\nThere’s plenty of blame to go around in the government shutdown.\n\nMore than 60% of U.S. adults say congressional Republicans, Democrats and Trump all deserve at least a fair amount of blame for the government shutdown, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll completed Oct. 8.\n\nThe survey found that 67% of adults believe congressional Republicans deserve a fair amount of blame, compared to 63% who say the same thing about Trump and congressional Democrats.\n\nTrump’s threat to fire federal workers is popular with Republicans, according to the poll, with 62% in favor. But GOP support for mass firings has declined 14 percentage points since a previous Reuters/Ipsos survey in April. Only 8% of Democrats support the firings.\n\nSenate to vote again to end shutdown with no end in sight\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to vote again Oct. 9 on competing proposals to reopen the government, but there are no signs the results will differ from the previous six failed attempts.\n\nVotes are set to start about 11:30 a.m. include a Democratic proposal to restore cuts in Medicaid and extend subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans who control the chamber propose to extend previously approved spending through Nov. 21, as the House GOP approved, and leave healthcare negotiations for later.\n\n\"The government needs to be funded, federal employees need to go back to work, federal agencies and departments need to be open in providing the services that the American people expect,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor Oct. 8. \"It’s that simple.\"\n\nMost Democrats continue to insist on remedying healthcare at the same time as reopening government. Three Senate Democrats have voted with Republicans to reopen government but the GOP needs another five to advance the bill.\n\n\"We can do both: fix health care and reopen the government,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on the Senate floor Oct. 8. \"This is not an either-or thing.\"\n\nTrump to hold Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump is set to hold a Cabinet meeting Thursday as the shutdown rolls on.\n\nIt will mark Trump's ninth Cabinet meeting of his second term.\n\nTrump's meetings with his Cabinet are typically lengthy affairs as his top officials, one-by-one, usually shower the president with praise and tout how they're carrying out his policy agenda.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is scheduled at 8:30 a.m. ET to appear on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" ‒ the longtime political show in which Americans call in to ask questions.\n\nTrump noncommittal about Obamacare subsidies\n\nTrump would not commit on Wednesday to supporting an extension of subsidies in the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\n\"All I want to do is very simple. I want to get the country open, and then we'll discuss that,\" Trump said when asked whether he wants to extend the subsidies.\n\nEarlier in the week, he had expressed openness to making a deal with Democrats to extend the subsidies.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have demanded that extending the health care subsidies be included in any funding bill to reopen the government. Republican leaders in Congress have repeatedly said they won't negotiate health care policy until the government is reopened.\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act subsidies are not renewed, premiums are expected to double, according to the research organization KFF.\n\nTrump claims some furloughed federal workers ‘won’t qualify’ for back pay\n\nTrump on Wednesday said most furloughed federal workers will receive their back pay when the government reopens but claimed some \"won’t qualify.\"\n\nThe president made the remarks one day after he threatened to withhold back pay from furloughed federal employees once the shutdown is over.\n\n“Most of them are going to get back pay, and we’re going to try and make of that,” Trump said. “But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats, and they therefore won’t qualify.”\n\nTrump did not specify why certain federal workers would not qualify to receive back pay owed to them.\n\nWithholding payments to furloughed workers when they return would mark a dramatic departure from previous shutdowns, including the government's last shutdown in 2019, when Trump was president.\n\nThe Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which was passed during the last shutdown and signed by Trump, says that federal workers who are furloughed during a lapse in government funding “shall be paid for the period of the lapse.” The law states that it applies to any government funding lapse after Dec. 22, 2018.\n\nBut the White House argues in a new legal memo that this law does not automatically cover all furloughed workers because of an amendment approved nine days after its original passage in January 2019.

We’ll take care of it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/25/government-shut-down-trump-mass-firing-threat/86344725007/", "title": "Will the government shut down? Trump's latest threat raises stakes", "text": "WASHINGTON – The stakes of an impending government shutdown just got much higher.\n\nIn a memo sent to federal agencies Sept. 24, President Donald Trump's White House Office of Management and Budget warned of potentially yet another round of mass firings if government funding lapses next week.\n\n\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown,\" the notice said.\n\nDays before a shutdown is set to begin after midnight on Oct. 1, the warning from the Trump administration sent a clear message to Democrats: This shutdown won’t be like others.\n\nPreviously, federal workers have been temporarily furloughed until lawmakers reached deals to turn the government’s lights back on − with Congress later voting to ensure the employees are paid during their time away. During the most recent 35-day shutdown, back in 2018, about 380,000 workers were furloughed while another 420,000 were on the job without pay (they were guaranteed back pay, though.)\n\nWhile that may still happen in many cases this time around, the OMB memo underlined Trump's willingness to use a shutdown as an opportunity to slash more government jobs and put pressure on Senate Democrats whose votes are needed to ensure the lights stay on.\n\nFears of further federal workforce reductions − amid already painful cuts enacted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency − had Democrats on edge during a moment of brinksmanship earlier this year over government spending. The executive branch has historically had large sway in using its spending powers during a shutdown, which led Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine more Democrats to join their GOP colleagues in voting to keep the government open.\n\n“It would be devastation like we have never seen,” Schumer said on “The View” in March. The White House, he argued at the time, “could cut off anything they want simply by saying it’s not essential.”\n\nMore than six months later, Democrats feel differently.\n\nAfter facing intense criticism for working with Republicans last time around, Schumer and many in his party are eager to use what little leverage Democrats have in a GOP-controlled Washington to push for concessions from Trump, particularly around health care.\n\nWith Musk pushed out of the administration and DOGE's influence waning, some onlookers predicted in the weeks leading up to the shutdown deadline that the White House would be less eager to terminate more jobs. The federal government is already on track to lose roughly 300,000 workers this year, officials have said. After announcing mass layoffs, many agencies eventually rehired for positions that were initially eliminated.\n\nThe OMB memo is nothing more than a scare tactic, Schumer said the day it went out.\n\n“This is an attempt at intimidation,\" he said in a statement. \"This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government. These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”\n\nTrump blamed Democrats when asked in the Oval Office Sept. 25 why the administration would push for layoffs in the event of a shutdown, rather than just furloughs.\n\n“This is all caused by the Democrats,” Trump told reporters. “They asked us to do something that is totally unreasonable. They never change.\"\n\nThe main union for federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, urged Republicans and Democrats to come together instead of scaring hardworking Americans.\n\n“Federal employees are not bargaining chips,\" the union's national president, Everett Kelley, said in a Sept. 25 statement. \"They are veterans, caregivers, law enforcement officers, and neighbors who serve their country and fellow Americans every day. They deserve stability and respect, not pink slips and political games.\"\n\nAre Republicans and Democrats any closer to a deal?\n\nDespite the White House's layoff threats, Democrats aren't yet budging. Republicans don't seem to be, either.\n\nGOP lawmakers and the president want to pass a stopgap measure that funds the government at current levels until just before Thanksgiving. Democrats say that's a nonstarter – unless Republicans help them extend expiring Obamacare subsidies and reverse recent Medicaid cuts.\n\nRead more: These people have found their health care at the center of a shutdown showdown\n\nRepublican leaders, worried about rising health care costs for their constituents, have expressed openness to dealing with at least some of those issues, just not when government funding is about to run out.\n\n\"I'm happy to have the conversation,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN on Sept. 24. “This is not the time and place to do this.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters this week that verbal commitments from GOP leaders won't be enough to satisfy Democrats.\n\n\"There's no trust that exists between House Democrats and House Republicans given the fact they've consistently tried to undermine bipartisan agreements that they themselves have reached,\" he said. \"Any agreement related to protecting health care has to be ironclad and in legislation.\"\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet this week with Schumer and Jeffries, but he canceled after deciding their demands were \"unserious and ridiculous.\" Schumer has said Democrats are still open to sitting down with the president to negotiate.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday he “couldn’t care less” if automakers raised prices due to new tariffs.\n\n\"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,\" Trump said in the interview.\n\nNBC said after the interview, a presidential aide told the network Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.\n\nThe problem is there are no completely American-made cars.

Here's what we know about the automotive tariffs so far:\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nPut simply, tariffs are additional taxes placed on imported goods to make those goods look undesirable to consumers in the U.S. Import tariffs historically have been used to try and boost sales of domestic products.\n\nManufacturers and producers of goods, however, typically pass price increases onto the consumer.\n\nWill auto tariffs raise car prices?\n\nAnalysts say the import tariffs aren't guaranteed to boost domestic production and sales of vehicles, but are likely to raise car prices for buyers.\n\n\"You're going to see price increases,\" Ivan Drury, director of insights at automotive research site Edmunds, told USA TODAY. \"It's such a shotgun approach. Virtually nothing goes unscathed.\"\n\nIn February, automotive analysts told the Free Press that a previous iteration of Trump's tariffs could raise vehicle prices anywhere from $1,000 to $9,000.\n\nThe average price for a new car was $48,039 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nWhile the auto tariffs target imported vehicles, prices of domestic cars could also increase, because the executive order also applies to some car parts, and domestic automakers import some of the components for their vehicles.\n\nWill auto tariffs affect used car prices?\n\nTypically, when the prices of new cars rise, the prices of used cars increase as well, Kelly Blue Book noted. Buyers hoping to avoid the higher cost of a new car could look for a deal on a used car, but if more buyers turn to pre-owned vehicles, the entire used car market could inflate.\n\nAccording to automotive analytics group CarGurus, the average price of a used car has slightly ticked up over the past month after months of decreases. The average used car price was $27,046 on Wednesday, according to CarGurus, down nearly 3% since November but higher than it was at the start of February, when the average used car price was $26,910.\n\nWill auto tariffs affect car sales?\n\nMost likely — analysts say the automotive market will take a hit due to the tariffs.\n\nCox Automotive, an Atlanta-based software and analytics company, had initially predicted 16.3 million cars would be sold in the U.S. this year, but now predicts 700,000 fewer cars will be sold in the U.S. this year because of uncertainty related to tariffs, the Free Press reported.\n\nIn 2024, there were an estimated 15.9 million sales of new vehicles, according to Wards Intelligence. That was the highest figure since 2019, and a 2.2% increase from 2023, Reuters reported.\n\nHow have automakers reacted?\n\nThe automotive industry generally has pushed against Trump's tariff plan, largely due to the volatility tariffs will create for the car market.\n\nThe Free Press has reported that executives from major automakers, including Detroit's Ford and General Motors, were either traveling to Washington or meeting remotely with members of the Trump Administration in an effort to stave off the tariffs. Trump previously delayed tariffs on auto parts from Mexico and Canada imported by domestic automakers, but said Wednesday the looming tariffs set by the executive order would not be postponed again. \"This is permanent, 100%,\" he said.\n\nContact Arpan Lobo: alobo@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/04/02/trump-car-tariffs-auto-april-us/82740924007/", "title": "Trump's new car tariffs start April 2 in US: What to know", "text": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week levying a 25% tariff on all cars and light-duty trucks imported into the U.S. Those tariffs go into effect April 2.\n\nSome experts don't believe these tariffs can realistically stick, even though Trump insisted they are permanent. The ultimate cost tariffs could have for automakers, suppliers and consumers alike is tough to nail down because of uncertainty around specifics, but the news has the industry spinning.\n\nHere are some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the impact of Trump's tariffs.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nGovernments impose tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, primarily to support local industries. U.S. consumers and businesses bear the actual cost of tariffs, not the foreign entities sending products. If a good cannot be made in America — like produce that only grows in certain countries or minerals not native to American soil — companies will likely add additional tariff costs to their pricing structure, ultimately costing the consumer.\n\nMeanwhile, tariffs as a form of taxation also provide community benefits. Tariffs provide tax income that goes to local and federal governments to further support local industries and fund public services.\n\nWhat is Liberation Day, or Freedom Day?\n\nThis refers to April 2, the day tariffs were announced, though it is confusing because Trump also said tariffs won't be collected until April 3. The White House said the executive order Trump signed to enact tariffs is under “Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.” Read more here about how Congress, through the act, gave the president — John F. Kennedy at the time — wider authority to slash U.S. tariffs worldwide in the face of Cold War pressures.\n\nTrump has dubbed Wednesday as “Liberation Day” because that is when his long-promised set of global tariffs are set to take effect, which he said will free the United States from a dependence on foreign goods and spark the rebirth of the nation being a manufacturing superpower.\n\nWill imposing tariffs bring auto jobs back to Michigan?\n\nHard to say. Tariffs would work to effectively reverse a trade environment between the U.S., Mexico and Canada that existed decades before President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1992. Ford Motor Co., for example, moved its first factory to Canada in 1904 on account of a standing 35% tariff held over from the days of carriage production. Back then, if you wanted to sell a vehicle in Canada, you had to build it there. In 1965, the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement was enacted, a precursor to NAFTA that removed tariffs between the two countries.\n\nWithout tariffs getting in the way, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler were able to “rationalize” their production in North America, meaning one factory made vehicles sent all around the continent rather than making that same vehicle in three plants in three countries. If tariffs last for an extended period of time, it may make more sense for automakers to move physical operations back to the U.S. than wait out Trump's time in office, but they would lose countless billions in the process from lost vehicle sales, increased material expenses, and abandoning investments in foreign plants.\n\nThose losses, experts have said, will inevitably lead to layoffs across the industry from salaried jobs to factory work. Metro Detroit car dealers have told the Free Press they worry sales will slow down and some local UAW leaders say they believe the tariff war will disrupt production, forcing work to pause and layoffs to follow. That's despite UAW President Shawn Fain backing tariffs, saying the practice will drive more manufacturing in the States and create jobs.\n\nOn March 26, steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said it will idle some operations at its Dearborn plant this summer, indicating “the current reality of weak automotive production in the U.S.” as the reason it will lay off about 600 employees. As to when those jobs could return, the company is similarly supportive of tariffs: “We believe that, once President Trump’s policies take full effect and automotive production is re-shored, we should be able to resume steel production at Dearborn Works.”\n\nShould I run out and buy a new car sooner rather than later?\n\nHonestly ... that's probably not a bad idea.\n\nAt the beginning of March there were 2.99 million new vehicles across the United States in inventory, said Mark Schirmer, spokesman for Cox Automotive. That is down slightly from the 3.2 million at the end of November, “but is a pretty healthy number,” he said.\n\nAs our Washington D.C. reporter points out, the Detroit Three and others rely on an integrated supply chain that may see a vehicle crisscross the borders with Mexico and Canada multiple times in many cases before its final assembly. If each time that vehicle crosses those borders, it's taxed, it will increase costs substantially.\n\nAuto industry expert Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of Market Research at Telemetry Insights, offered an example to the Free Press in a February article. He centered on an automaker, which he declined to name, that gets the materials to make wire harnesses from Japan. Those materials go to Mexico to be made into the harness, then those harnesses are shipped to Texas to be attached to an air bag. Those are then shipped back to the automaker's plant in Mexico to be installed into a car seat. Then the vehicle is shipped back into the United States. If those parts are taxed each time they cross those borders, the bill could run into tens of thousands of dollars for this automaker, Abuelsamid said.\n\nHow much could vehicle prices rise?\n\nTariffs won't cause only new car prices to rise. Used car prices may jump too, analysts say, and selection, especially of lightly used vehicles, will dwindle. Less inventory not only means fewer options for shoppers, but fewer discounts as dealers are less likely to part with that inventory. Some analysts say consumers looking for a deal may already be too late.\n\nThere are all kinds of estimates on price hikes from as low as $3,000 per car to as high as $15,000. According to the Wall Street firm Wedbush Securities, this tariff, in its current form, would send the auto industry into upside down mode and raise the average price of cars between $5,000 on the low end and $10,000 to $15,000 on the high end, according to Dan Ives, managing director, in a research note Monday.\n\nThe uber-luxury sports car manufacturer Ferrari appears to be the first automaker to say it will be raising its prices by a maximum of 10% on all models imported to the United States after April 2, according to Reuters. Ferrari manufactures all its cars at its Maranello facility, in northern Italy.\n\nHow will tariffs affect automakers and suppliers?\n\nLast month, Cox Automotive lowered its full-year new vehicle sales forecast by 700,000 to 15.6 million due to tariffs disrupting the industry. Its senior economist Charles Chesbrough said new car sales in the second quarter will be slower than in the first quarter, and “if these tariffs stick, the second half of 2025 will see obvious changes in prices and sales pace.”\n\nMany auto suppliers are reporting that their customers, many of whom are automakers, are in a state of paralysis and have delayed or canceled jobs. The suppliers are working to manage costs so they don't lay off workers in the event that their clients restart programs and need the suppliers to be able to jump back into jobs.\n\nWill tariffs mean I'll pay more for car repairs?\n\nIn short, yes, unless you act quickly.\n\nSkyler Chadwick, director of Product Consulting at Cox Automotive, said consumers have about four to six weeks to act before parts inventory at dealership and independent repair shops start to run low.\n\nAt that point, the shops will need to order new parts to do repairs. Many parts come from overseas, in fact, 44% of automaker collision repair parts are imported, Chadwick said. That means, those parts will be tariffed and you can count on the repair shops passing that extra cost onto the customer.\n\n“If I was a consumer, I would not be putting off my service and repairs. Let’s take brakes into consideration here, if I look at a brake job, on average we see between a $500 and $800 repair on each axle depending on your (automaker) and brand,” Chadwick said. “You could see essentially the cost going up between $150 to $200 in a price on those specific parts. Everybody’s going to be affected.”\n\nWhat car brands are affected by tariffs?\n\nYou can find a complete list of car brands that tariffs will impact here.\n\nBasically, no automaker is immune. According to the 2024 Made In America Auto Index from American University, the Tesla Model 3 Performance has the most domestic content of any car sold in the United States with 87.5% of its parts domestically sourced, but even it will not emerge as a winner.\n\nMost automakers that assemble cars in the United States have about 40% to 50% of parts that come from abroad, Ives said. Ford has one of the largest manufacturing footprints in the United States of all carmakers. It imports just 21% of the vehicles it sells here. Yet, CEO Jim Farley told the Ford workforce that regardless of that fact, Ford is not “immune to the impact of tariffs, which could be meaningful.”\n\nFarley said Ford was studying the potential impact tariffs could have on the Dearborn-based automaker's operations and he anticipates the fallout from tariffs are, “likely to be significant across our industry.”\n\nGeneral Motors imports about 46% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S., according to research firm GlobalData. In a message it posted last week on GM's internal website, which was obtained by the Detroit Free Press, the company wrote: “We are now identifying potential impacts by supplier, vehicle program, plant, and other factors, and working through what we need to do and when. We are in a strong position to navigate this dynamic situation and will continue to deliver for our customers, employees, and communities. Each of us can contribute by staying focused and delivering on plans for this year, maintaining a disciplined approach and managing discretionary costs.”\n\nThe tariffs, if levied as proposed, would also have a direct impact on numerous Stellantis vehicles sold in the United States in addition to the effect on components shipped here. For example, the company makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S as well as Ram Heavy Duty trucks and the Ram ProMaster van in Mexico. The Dodge Charger Daytona and Chrysler Pacifica are assembled in Canada. The company also ships other vehicles from Europe.\n\nFree Press staff writer Eric D.

For imported cars protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, only the foreign parts that make up the vehicle will be subject to the tariff.\n\n“We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth,” Trump said inside the Oval Office. He said the tariffs will \"spur growth like you haven’t seen before.”\n\nThe move follows a temporary tariff exemption granted earlier this month at the behest of three large U.S. automakers.

Some companies may pass price hikes from the 25% tariff directly to consumers, while others may bear some of the costs to remain competitive and ease cost pressures in other ways, such as reducing incentives.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nBut with the tariff expected to hit both imported vehicles and key auto parts like engines and transmissions, Drury said consumers can expect price increases \"across the board.\" That includes new cars, used cars, maintenance costs and even insurance premiums, because accidents involving new parts would be more costly.\n\nCars assembled in the U.S. wouldn't be safe from tariffs either, Drury said, because they import parts from other countries.\n\n\"There is no vehicle that is 100% American in that regard,\" Drury said. Used vehicles will see \"a bit more lag time, but there will be an effect.\"\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said questions remain on exactly how these tariffs will be applied or whether they will be altered in the coming weeks. In their current form, he estimates they could push up the average car price $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the make and model.\n\nThe tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers,\" Ives said in a note Wednesday. But \"we continue to believe this is some form of negotiation and these tariffs could change.\"\n\nIf tariffs do hold, they could encourage increased investment in U.S. manufacturing and a more resilient auto industry, according to a note from Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. But those potential long-term benefits will take time.\n\n\"For consumers navigating higher prices in the short term, the promise of future gains may feel distant − at least for now,\" Caldwell said.\n\nHow much does a new car cost today?\n\nThe tariffs come shortly after pandemic-era supply chain disruptions pushed up car prices for U.S. drivers. New vehicle prices are up about 25% since early 2020, according to Kelley Blue Book, with the average transaction price for a new vehicle just above $48,000 as of February.\n\nMeanwhile, higher interest rates have pushed up auto loans, which makes affording a new vehicle “a real challenge for most households,” Erin Keating, executive analyst for Cox Automotive, said in a statement this month.\n\nAnother report from AAA found the cost the total cost to own and operate a new vehicle was roughly $1,025 a month in 2024, including expenses like maintenance, fuel, insurance, financing and depreciation. That's up more than $200 a month from 2021.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/11/14/used-car-prices-drop-demand-for-cars-shoots-up/76217745007/", "title": "Used car prices continue to drop as demand for cars shoots up", "text": "Consumer demand for new and used vehicles bounced back in October after a slight dip in September, as prices continue to drop, according to new data.\n\nCarGurus, an online new and used vehicle shopping site, released its U.S. 2024 October Intelligence Report this week, showing that new vehicle inventory was increasing and used vehicle inventory levels were stabilizing.\n\nThe shift in supply and stronger-than-expected demand in the second half have brought down the average used vehicle list price to $28,200, 5% lower than a year ago, when the average price was $29,700, the report stated. In September, the average used vehicle listing price was $28,400. The average listing price for a new vehicle last month was $49,700, down from $50,700 a year ago. The listing price is the average price dealers ask, whereas the average transaction price data is from actual sales in October.\n\nBecause of the much lower average used vehicle price, used cars are selling more quickly than new vehicles.\n\n\"Although demand increased for both new and used vehicles in October, improvements in used car pricing and inventory have particularly driven shoppers to this segment where time on lot is now down 4% year-over-year, compared to a 30% increase for new,\" Kevin Roberts, CarGurus’ director of economic and market intelligence, said in a statement.\n\nCarGurus’ report showed demand for used vehicles increased nearly 6% compared with October 2023. Likewise, new car demand increased 8% year over year.\n\nBut according to early October data from Cox Automotive, inventory across new and used vehicles is tighter than a year ago, and expected to remain tight, which will push prices higher.\n\nMore certified used vehicles available\n\nCarGurus' Roberts said the inventory of used vehicles has stabilized due to an influx of 2022 and 2024 model vehicles.\n\n“The 2024 models coming into the used market are a small proportion of used inventory, representing over 100,000 listings, but it is helping with the late model year shortage,\" Roberts explained. \"It’s hard to pinpoint where exactly they’re coming from, but it could be a mix of fleet vehicles and consumers changing their minds after buying new models.\"\n\nRoberts said listings for certified pre-owned vehicles rose 8% last month compared with a year ago, \"which have helped offset the late model year shortage that has put pressure on pricing.\"\n\nRoberts pointed to the growing supply of certified pre-owned vehicles is one component sparking used vehicle demand as car buyers look for the assurances of a new vehicle without the high price tag. This boost in certified pre-owned inventory rather than just regular used vehicles is because automakers are stretching the qualifications for a car to be certified pre-owned, he said.\n\nSales of new vehicles in 2021, 2022, and 2023 were lower than usual due to inventory constraints, so relatively few late-model vehicles are coming in to dealerships. Therefore, the average age of certified pre-owned vehicles has increased by nearly 1.5 years to 4.5 years old from January 2020 to October 2024, Roberts said.\n\nOther key finds include:\n\nNew vehicle inventory continues to increase: Inventory is up 40% year over year, causing average new vehicle prices to slowly moderate.\n\nInventory is up 40% year over year, causing average new vehicle prices to slowly moderate. New EV pricing is down: The average EV list price was $61,600 in October, down 1.7% year-over-year. The number of new EVs listed on CarGurus increased 44.1% year-over-year.\n\nThe average EV list price was $61,600 in October, down 1.7% year-over-year. The number of new EVs listed on CarGurus increased 44.1% year-over-year. New hybrid prices are on par with gasoline vehicles: The price of hybrids and internal combustion engine vehicles converged, with hybrid prices moving below internal combustion engine vehicles by $88. At the same time in 2023, the spread between the two was over $4,000.\n\nSpread between new and used cars keeps growing\n\nCox Automotive also sees automakers expanding the qualifications for certified pre-owned and noted that there are older vehicles in the mix, said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights and corporate communications.\n\nSchirmer said Cox has not yet released its full October data results, but he confirmed that used-vehicle prices have been trending lower all year despite inventory tightening. Cox reported the days supply of used vehicles last month was 45, 16% below inventory levels of October 2023. The industry considers a healthy days supply of inventory to be 60 days. Schirmer said there was an 85-day supply of new vehicles, up 10 days from a year ago.\n\nHe said Cox has the average listing price for a used vehicle last month at $25,499, up $160 from September, but 4% lower than October 2023. For new vehicles, the average listing price in October was $48,117, up 1.8% from $47,253 in the year-ago period. But, \"higher incentives are helping keep prices down for consumers,\" Schirmer said.\n\n\"The spread between new and used average listing prices, in September, was indeed near the highest point on record — more than $22,000,\" Schirmer said in an email. \"Our team usually talks about a natural gap between the two, and the waterfall effect that happens when new-vehicle prices come down, they push down used prices.\"\n\nThat price gap between the average list price for a new car compared with that of a used car in the 2019 to 2022 timeframe was around $18,000, he said. For 2023, the price difference jumped to about $21,000, and it has been higher this year, Schirmer said.\n\n\"We’ve been talking about weak used-vehicle prices all year, as new-vehicle inventory improves and discounts increase. But one nuance here: The world of used cars is getting older,\" Schirmer said. \"The bucket of available cars on used-vehicle lots has fewer ‘nearly new' vehicles in it. With fewer nearly new in the average, the big average is pulled lower, increasing the spread to new. New car prices have been flat. Used car prices trending.\"\n\nContact Jamie L.

Even the most American-made car contains a good percentage of parts imported from other countries. Those parts could now be subject to 25% taxes paid by the importers, in this case the car companies, to bring them over the U.S. border. Parts that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt, but only for now.\n\nOn Thursday, many analysts said they believe these tariffs cannot realistically stick, even though Trump insisted they are permanent. And many experts struggled to predict the ultimate impact it could have for automakers, suppliers and even consumers because of uncertainty around to what exactly the tariffs will apply and how they will be implemented.\n\n“We’re assuming that they’re going to go by percentage of content and the tariff will be on that portion of it, but I’ve heard nothing from the factory yet because I assume they’re still scrambling to figure out what is happening,\" said Gordon Stewart, owner of car dealership Gordon Chevrolet in Garden City.\n\nOne thing seems unanimous among analysts, however: No matter where the car is made, these tariffs will increase the price of new cars by thousands of dollars because automakers cannot absorb all of the cost increases the tariffs will bring. The notion of shifting parts production to the United States is not realistic because many parts cannot be made here. In addition, it costs billions of dollars and takes at least three years to build a new factory.\n\n\"If truly 'permanent,' a 25% tariff on all imports into the U.S. market would represent a significant (if not unprecedented) increase in the prices of cars, effectively inflating the average price of a vehicle by 11% or 12% (all else equal) and raising the average monthly auto loan payment from approximately $750/month to $830 or $840/month,\" wrote Morgan Stanley autos analyst Adam Jonas in a Thursday morning research note. \"Actual impact will depend on a number of factors, including the role of finance subs (and captives) on leasing and loan terms. This will be the first and most obvious reaction to a tariff implementation of this magnitude.\"\n\nLonger term, Jonas said, the tariffs could create the \"Cubanization\" of vehicles in the States, referring to how in Cuban people keep their cars for many years, sometimes decades, because buying a new car is so expensive because of a U.S. trade embargo.\n\nExamples of US-made cars impact\n\nThe Detroit Three automakers declined to comment, referring the Detroit Free Press to a statement by the American Automotive Policy Council, the group that represents the automakers in Washington.\n\n\"U.S. automakers are committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the administration on durable policies that help Americans,\" said former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the AAPC, in the statement. \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President’s USMCA agreement,\" a reference to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during Trump's first term.\n\nNew car prices are expected to rise, experts predict. An example: BMW produces the X5 sport utility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. He said this model is one of the biggest exports in the United States auto sector with roughly 40% of production headed for outside markets. Currently, more than 68% of the vehicle’s components are imported, including the European-made engine and transmission.\n\n\"An applied tariff of 25% on those parts would add around $8,000 to the cost of making this vehicle and reducing the demand considerably as BMW would be forced to increase its price to all markets,\" Fiorani said.\n\nSimilarly, while Dearborn-based Ford Motor Co. assembles 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States domestically, it does get parts from other countries that go into those vehicles. It also sells vehicles made here in other countries. The Ford F-Series Super Duty pickup, for example, is assembled in Louisville, Kentucky, but all the gasoline V8 engines come from Windsor, Ontario, and the diesel V8s in it are made in Mexico, with other assorted parts also imported including the aluminum for the bodies, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of Market Research at Telemetry Insights.\n\nAbuelsamid predicts the tariffs will drive the average new vehicle price up by 15%, he said.\n\nJeff Windau, industrials analyst at Edward Jones, told the Free Press that the Detroit Three are hurt somewhat less by the tariffs than are their foreign counterparts.\n\n“I would say they are all global companies and they do sell abroad, so you’ll start to see (retaliatory tariff) actions taken abroad that make them less competitive in these international markets,” Windau said. “They’ll have to look at their manufacturing footprint and supply chain and have to move some things around … which will probably raise prices for consumers and pressure sales in the industry. I feel everybody will be impacted.”\n\nDeutsche Bank's Edison Yu agreed that manufacturing shifts will be needed. In a research note Thursday, Yu wrote: \"Even if the tariffs are modified and/or exemptions are granted, the industry may not return to the status quo for the next four years.\"\n\nYu wrote that Tesla, which makes the most purely American-made vehicles, and Ford, are the most shielded from the tariffs, although Ford faces incremental exposure on imported engines.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in February that enduring 25% tariffs \"would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen.\"\n\n\"GM has the most exposure to Mexico,\" Yu wrote. \"On the suppliers, virtually all will be subject to the derivative impact of tariffs, in our view. We expect OEMs to evaluate footprints against model/profitability and assess production levels to align with economic sensibility, causing ... lower net volumes.\"\n\nLess production means fewer factory jobs.\n\n'Trying to hit a dancing target'\n\nAt Gordon Chevrolet, Stewart said he has about a 40-day supply of new cars on the ground, so he's not worried yet about the impact from the new tariff.\n\n“With all the fluctuations that have happened in the last 30 days, I’m not panicking yet,\" Stewart told the Free Press. \"All the uncertainties we’ve seen, I think everything is subject to change. There are still negotiations going on with Mexico. We’re, and by we, I mean General Motors, is still trying to hit a dancing target.”\n\nSimilarly, auto analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities pointed to the stock market Thursday morning where stock prices for the Detroit Three were taking a beating. He said the market is calling Trump's bluff.\n\n\"They're saying this is in pencil not pen,\" Ives told the Free Press. \"This (tariff) is not possible. The reality of enacting this is impossible. It’s a fictional tell. Even an American car made in America with American workers has foreign parts. There are parts of engines and parts of chips where they don’t have the parts in the United States, and it takes three years to build a factory. So how’s that going to work?\"\n\nIves predicts that new vehicle prices could rise by $5,000 to $10,000 to offset what automakers and suppliers will pay in tariffs either to import vehicles or parts. He derived that figure by looking at \"the parts sourced from the average car and half the cars in the United States are imported and 60% to 70% of cars have auto parts that are foreignly sourced.\"\n\nHe said his team estimates the tariffs will add $100 billion to $125 billion in costs across the entire auto industry.\n\nProtect the rich, annex Canada?\n\nIn early March, Trump postponed auto tariffs for 30 days. But on Wednesday, he said no more pauses in tariffs for the auto sector. \"This is permanent, 100%,\" he said.\n\nTrump said his executive order would force more automakers to move into the country and create jobs. The tariffs will take effect on or after 12:01 a.m. April 3 for automobiles, and on the \"date specified in the Federal Register for automobile parts,\" but no later than May 3.\n\nTrump said the tariff will help the auto industry to \"flourish\" and create new jobs as factories will start springing up stateside. An aide said the tariffs are expected to produce $100 billion a year in revenue for the federal government. Trump pegged it at potentially more than six times that over two years. That revenue could help to offset Trump keeping in place tax cuts passed in his first term, which are due to expire Dec. 31.\n\nBut the move also is an assault on Canada, which Trump is insistent about annexing in some fashion. Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Trump 25% tariffs would destroy Canada's economy.\n\nIn an emergency news conference Wednesday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney condemned Trump's announcement as a \"direct attack\" on Canada's autoworkers.\n\n\"We have put in place the mechanisms where, if it is appropriate to put in place retaliatory tariffs ... we will take the steps that are in the interests of Canadian workers,\" Carney, who has called a snap election for April 28 after taking over for Trudeau. \"We are entirely aligned in terms of the seriousness we are taking this and the seriousness of our response.\"\n\nA Ford factory in Canada, devastated\n\nJohn D'Agnolo had a headache, a real, physical headache, Thursday morning from processing the tariff news.\n\nD'Agnolo is President of Unifor Local 200 in Windsor. His local represents some 2,000 workers at Ford's engine plants, which supply many of the engines used in the F-Series pickups that are made in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nHe told the Free Press on Thursday that Trump's tariffs imposed on Canada are completely unjustified.\n\n\"I am looking at what we continuously do, everything we've done in Canada to support the United States. It is a fair trade agreement, what we have today,\" D'Agnolo said. \"These are additional costs and it makes no sense.\"\n\nHe said Trump's move hurts U.S. citizens beyond autos. He said the connection Canada has with Michigan, its border locale, is like no other and it is being damaged.\n\n\"It makes me sick that he's doing this to Michigan to be honest, because now we're not going there anymore,\" D'Agnolo said. \"Who wants to isolate a country like that and destroy those businesses? This is more than about autos. I spent more money in Michigan than anywhere, I love that state. This is devastating.\"\n\nHe points to the fact that in 2024, Ford sold 134,000 F-Series pickups in Canada, all of which were made in the United States.\n\n\"I built the engine, but the trucks are all built there (in the United States),\" D'Agnolo said. \"How am I ripping them off? We don't build these vehicles in Canada and thousands of vehicles are built in the United States and I'm ripping him off? Am I frustrated? Yes. Is he lying? Yes. All it's doing is destroying lives on both sides of the border.\"\n\nD'Agnolo said Canada will be forced to protect itself by implementing retaliatory tariffs or requiring any vehicles sold in Canada be built in Canada. In the meantime, he is more worried than ever that Trump is serious about annexing Canada because \"he needs our natural resources.\"\n\n\"That's why he's looking at Greenland, looking at Ukraine,\" D'Agnolo said. \"We could build a chip plant in our country no problem because we have the resources to do that. He realizes battery is coming. He needs the lithium, we have the nickel and we have the cobalt. All the things he needs to make these batteries are in Canada.\"\n\nLower sales forecast\n\nThe sales of new cars have held up through all of this volatility so far, but most experts predict the tariffs will start taking a toll.\n\nAt the beginning of March there were 2.99 million new vehicles across the United States in inventory, said Mark Schirmer, spokesman for Cox Automotive. That is down slightly from the 3.2 million at the end of November, \"but is a pretty healthy number,\" he said.\n\nIt has to be, because Chevy dealer Stewart said there is no way GM or any automaker could move fast enough to get dealers considerably more vehicles in stock in just a week. With the \"just-in-time production\" system at factories, it would be difficult for automakers get enough parts to the assembly lines to significantly speed up production by April 3, he said.\n\nCharles Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox said now that the tariffs are out, \"I think we will see a stronger finish to March than we had expected (in sales), and prices will begin rising, but not on everything and not all at once. Each dealer and market will approach this differently at first.\"\n\nChesbrough said new car sales in the second quarter will be slower than in the first quarter, and \"if these tariffs stick, the second half of 2025 will see obvious changes in prices and sales pace.\" On Wednesday, Cox lowered its full-year new vehicle sales forecast by 700,000 to 15.6 million due to tariffs disrupting the industry.\n\nOn Thursday, Edmunds.com forecasted that 3.8 million new vehicles will have been sold in the United States in the first quarter, a 1% increase from the year-ago period.\n\n“Inventory levels were healthy for many brands, incentives continued to make a comeback, and there was clear evidence of pent-up demand after the sluggish sales years that followed 2020,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights.\n\nShe said automotive tariffs might have pulled ahead some vehicle purchases, but results were largely driven by the strength of the industry’s underlying fundamentals. The \"road ahead is less certain,\" she said.\n\n“Looking ahead, the newly announced 25% tariffs on imported vehicles add another layer of difficulty for shoppers already facing high prices and interest rates,” said Ivan Drury, Edmunds’ director of insights.\n\n'Customers should act now'\n\nAccording to Edmunds.com the average transaction price for new vehicles in February was $47,373 and the average sticker for new vehicles was $49,350, making the average discount for new vehicles $1,977. The average transaction price for used vehicles was $25,005.\n\n“Shoppers should expect increased competition on dealer lots as news of the tariffs will likely fuel short-term demand from buyers trying to lock in deals before potential price hikes,\" Drury said. \"If you’re planning to buy soon, it’s worth starting your search now. Once tariffs take effect, discounts will be harder to come by and, if spending a bit more today gets you the car you really want, it could save you money in the long run.”\n\nIndeed, Matick Automotive Group Partner Paul Zimmermann told the Free Press he has about a 60-day supply of GM vehicles at Matick Chevrolet in Redford Township and Matick Buick-GMC in Southfield. At his Matick Toyota store in Macomb, he has a 40-day supply. While both are good levels of inventory, Zimmermann said, \"Customers should act now.\"\n\nHe is confident in GM and Toyota leaders to have contingency plans to keep dealers supplied, and the \"customer base will be protected as they navigate through the changes,\" Zimmermann told the Free Press. But he said, \"I now think these (tariffs) will be in place longer than I originally thought. Quantifying amount of content built in the U.S. as well as maybe moving some production back to the U.S. might have to be done in an effort to alleviate the tariffs.\"\n\nJamie L.

Some vehicles would be affected more than others. They also estimate that more than 165,000 autoworkers could be laid off if tariffs remain in place for any considerable time.\n\nIf Trump enacts tariffs, the timeline for price hikes and job cuts could vary to within a few weeks or months, depending on the vehicle and the inventory that is in stock, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of Market Research at Telemetry Insights.\n\nThat's because tariffs — the taxes on goods that cross international borders — do not get applied until the products actually cross the border.\n\n\"Anything that is in inventory as of today isn’t affected. Everything that crosses the border from tomorrow on gets a tariff,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Price changes will vary based on the models, with more popular models that have lower inventories being hit the soonest.\"\n\nFor example, Toyota has tight inventory of the Rav4 SUV and Honda has short supply of CR-Vs and Civics, he said. All three vehicles are assembled in Canada and they probably would see an impact from tariffs within a few weeks. The Jeep Compass, made by Stellantis, is built in Mexico. It might take a bit longer for it to be impacted because Stellantis has a good supply of inventory on the Compass, Abuesamid said.\n\n\"Prices will likely remain elevated for a similar period after tariffs are removed until that inventory is depleted,\" Abuelsamid said. \"But parts going through the supply chain might add several weeks or months before you see adjustments.\"\n\nPut simply by economist Michael Hicks, who spoke to the Free Press on Monday before Trump agreed to the pause, \"This is the one-time biggest tax increase on America in history. So it predictably has the effect of dampening economic activity. The people affected most will be the people who are renting, people who need to buy cars, people who need to buy computers.”\n\nHicks, a professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, estimates the proposed tariffs would amount to a $2,000 tax on average household spending, hitting lower-income people the hardest.\n\nWhere it stands at the moment\n\nTrump has said the new tax is needed to mitigate an influx of immigration and fentanyl trafficking over the U.S. borders. Canada moved to retaliate by imposing its own tariffs on U.S. imports, and China and Mexico have said they also would respond. Both Canada and Mexico agreed to new border security and anti-fentanyl measures in calls with Trump on Monday.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau each agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to their U.S. borders to fight illegal immigration and drugs.\n\nAround 90% of auto exports from both Mexico and Canada go to the U.S., according to the Mexican Automotive Manufacturers' Association and the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association. Detroit, of course, is at the epicenter of domestic impact.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Stellantis did not provide new comments about the pending tariff plans. All had said previously, in some fashion, that they believed Trump shares their goal of a strong U.S. auto industry and could make some adjustments to their manufacturing.\n\nStellantis deferred its comment to the American Automotive Policy Council. Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the council, said last month that cars and parts that meet the USMCA’s rules of origin should be exempt from any new tariffs.\n\n“If these tariffs are imposed, all vehicles and parts that comply with current USMCA trade agreement rules should be exempt, as they meet the strict standards originally negotiated by President Trump to support jobs and investment in the United States,” Blunt said.\n\nThe industry's lobby group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, had this to say on Saturday from CEO John Bozzella: “Seamless automotive trade in North America accounts for $300 billion in economic value. It not only keeps us globally competitive, it supports auto industry jobs, vehicle choice and vehicle affordability in America. We look forward to working with the administration on solutions that achieve the president’s goals and preserve a healthy, competitive auto industry in America.”\n\nBut the impact from tariffs, if imposed, could be quick, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.\n\n\"Just-in-time supply of parts could hamper production quickly,\" Fiorani told the Free Press on Monday. \"Tariffs applied to high-value parts such as engines and transmissions sourced from Canada will add dramatically to the cost of vehicles produced in the U.S. Where that cost rises too much, as in engines for the Ford F-150 and SuperDuty trucks and transmissions for the Chevrolet Corvette, production could come to a halt very quickly.\"\n\nNearly all automakers will have to raise prices\n\nAbuelsamid told the Free Press on Monday that if tariffs are imposed and stay in place for the entire year, he projects a loss of 2 million vehicle sales in North America for 2025, with the exact impact varying based on model and inventory. About 200,000 of those sales will be lost in Canada, the rest in the States. He said even shorter-term tariffs would have an impact on the economy that will persist for some time after they are lifted.\n\n“That’s in large part going to be due to higher prices. The automakers do not have the profit margins to absorb a 10% to 25% tariff. That will be passed on to consumers,” Abuelsamid said, adding that vehicles are “already too expensive” for many car buyers to afford.\n\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new car in December was $49,740. Abuelsamid predicts the tariff increases would impact the wholesale price on a vehicle by 18% to 20%, which then will translate to a \"20-ish-%\" increase in the price to a consumer. That means on a $49,000 car today, the price could go up by $9,800 or more, he said.\n\n\"Actually, it’ll probably be worse than that,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Supply chains are complicated and there are a number of components that cross borders a number of times.”\n\nEach time a part crosses a border, it will be taxed, he said. An example Abuelsamid gave is an automaker that he declined to name told him it gets the materials to make wire harnesses from Japan. Those materials go to Mexico to be made into the wiring harness, then those harnesses are shipped to Texas to be attached to an air bag. Those are then shipped back to the automaker's plant in Mexico to be installed into a car seat. Then the vehicle is shipped back into the United States.\n\n\"So you’re going to pay tariffs the two times it comes into the U.S. and potentially the two times it goes into Mexico,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Another example is the Ford F-Series pickups with the V8. Those V8 engines are built in Windsor, so Ford is going to pay a 25% tariff for every engine they bring into Dearborn and pay tariffs for other components that come into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico. Even if the vehicle is built here, they will have a tariff impact.\"\n\nHe said nearly all vehicles would see some tariff impact. To shift production of all parts and vehicles to the United States, Abuelsamid said takes years to do, \"which means consumers will pay for many years.\"\n\nSoft impact on prices, for now\n\nOthers see a lesser impact. Dan Ives, global head of Technology Research and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities said in a Monday research note, \"While GM, Ford and Stellantis are heavily tied to much production in these countries, we believe the supply chain can adjust to a near-term shock and weather the storm.\"\n\nIves said if tariffs stay in place for 30 to 60 days, it should have minimal impact on GM and Ford. But if tariffs last longer than 90 days, Ives forecasts the average transaction price on a new vehicle could rise by $1,000 to $2,000.\n\nFiorani of AutoForecast Solutions added that key models likely to be impacted the most by tariffs include the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Chrysler Pacifica, Ram 2500/3500 pickup, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Blazer, Ford Maverick and Ford Bronco Sport.\n\n\"Other models are important, especially the EVs, but these models make up significant revenue and profits,\" Fiorani said. \"Among the most profitable vehicles from these regions are the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, which have redundant production facilities in the U.S. Production of these two trucks will continue, despite parts coming from Canada, to maintain a level of inventory, but that, too, will begin to slide.\"\n\nHe said in the short term, sticker prices won’t change in the hope that the trade issues will be brief, but as supplies of these models slip, transaction prices will rise.\n\n\"Large enough inventories of most vehicles will keep consumers and dealers happy for a few weeks, but before the end of February, should the issue remain, we will see shortages of popular models,\" Fiorani said. \"Canada’s largest U.S. trading partners include Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and those states make up more than 50% of U.S. vehicle production.\"\n\nPrepare for significant layoffs\n\nIn the United States, 15.9 new vehicles were sold in 2024. If tariffs erode those sales by about 2 million vehicles, Abuelsamid would expect to see 15% to 20% of all U.S. autoworkers to be laid off. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were about 1.1 million motor vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs as of December. That means 165,000 or more people could lose their jobs.\n\n“It’s going to mean significant layoffs,\" Abuelsamid said. \"And, for every automaker job, there are seven other jobs that depend on those.\"\n\nIn addition, many of the smaller suppliers that make parts for bigger suppliers are already under pressure to lower costs.\n\n\"A lot of these are smaller companies. They cannot afford to absorb these extra costs,\" Abuelsamid said. \"So you will see a lot of them go out of business.\"\n\nA big blow to Michigan\n\nIf there's any doubt to that, Hicks has studied the impact from Trump's 10% tariff he put on China during his first term in office, which President Joe Biden left in place. It took about six months before the United States saw the first impacts on costs rising on goods from China and a loss of jobs across all types of U.S. manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHis data showed that in January 2017, Michigan had 617,000 manufacturing jobs. By the time the tariffs hit in March 2018, there were 627,000 manufacturing jobs with employment hitting a peak in December of that year at 633,900. But that would be the last time Michigan saw that level of employment in manufacturing.\n\n\"In January 2020, the last month before the COVID pandemic hit, there were 619,000 manufacturing jobs in Michigan,\" Hicks said. \"So the Trump administration had effectively killed off all the manufacturing job growth by the month before COVID and that was due to tariffs.”\n\nAuto industry sales had slowed substantially and the Midwest was at the cusp of a recession, but COVID-19 masked the impact of the tariffs, and Hicks said, \"That tariff was nothing compared to what we are seeing being proposed.”\n\nHe said Michigan imports some $300 billion worth of goods between Canada and Mexico each year. so tariffs that run from one to six months would result in the loss of many jobs. It will also cause people to put off buying cars, homes or doing home improvement since a lot of lumber comes from Canada. All of it impacts Michigan's economy.\n\n“Last time (in 2018), you lost 15,000 manufacturing jobs, and that was just with tariffs of 10% on China. So you would expect this to be much worse. China is a far-off trading partner. Now you’re talking about your most profitable trading partners who are buying a ton of stuff,\" Hicks said. \"This isn’t going to do anything to make Michigan great again.”\n\nHeaded for a major recession\n\nU.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Birmingham, said on MSNBC on Monday morning that the \"draconian tariffs\" Trump threatened to impose on Canada feel more like a tax on Michiganders and the fallout will be severe.\n\n\"We’re looking at increased cost to consumers,\" Stevens said. \"I have spent the weekend ... talking about what is going to happen to plants, Michigan automotive plants. I’ll tell ya, I’m hearing some are going to shut down. This is a tough moment for us. Sometimes tariffs can be used in a strategic and coordinated way, but on our best trading partner, that is going to hurt us here in Michigan.\"\n\nStevens, who worked on former President Barack Obama's auto task force in 2009 that helped guide General Motors and then-Chrysler Corp. through bankruptcy, said she knows the auto industry well and it does not need any disruptions right now.\n\n\"People are working so darn hard, they’re putting the world on wheels,\" Stevens said. \"Now, all of sudden, we’re going to say, 'Hey we have to stop manufacturing for today because we don’t have trade at the level we used to with Canada.' They buy Michigan goods. We sell into Canada.\"\n\nStevens said the Democrats are prepared to fight, accusing the Trump administration of acting unilaterally without the consent of Congress.\n\nIf Trump does enact the tariffs, the economic impact will resonate from the auto industry across the economy to grocery prices and even housing prices given much of the softwood lumber used in framing new houses comes from Canada, said Abuelsamid.\n\n\"It’s going to be really, really bad for the U.S. economy,\" Abuelsamid said. \"We’re going to have a major recession here in the United States if this continues.”\n\nJamie L.

Honda has said it will build the next-generation Civic at its existing plant in Indiana rather than in Mexico, but “Honda did not announce plans for a new plant in the U.S. at this time,\" according to a statement provided to the Free Press from America Honda spokesperson Chris Martin. The statement added: \"We have invested over $3 billion in advanced vehicle manufacturing in America in just the past three years, with a cumulative total of more than $24.7 billion\" over 45 years.\n\nSaid Trump, \"It’s off to the races. I think our automobile business will flourish like it's never flourished before.\"\n\nWhile some, including the UAW, applaud Trump's move, others say it will cause new vehicle prices to rise and be detrimental to many automakers.\n\n\"In our view these initial tariffs (if they hold in their current form) would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many U.S.) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5,000 to $10,000 depending on the make/model/price point,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research note Wednesday night. \"We continue to believe this is some form of negotiation and these tariffs could change by the week, although this initial 25% tariff on autos from outside the U.S. is almost an untenable, head-scratching number for the U.S. consumer.\"\n\n[STAY UP TO DATE: Sign up for our Daily Briefing newsletter today to get the Free Press in your inbox. ]\n\n'A very simple system'\n\nWhile Trump in the recent past has postponed auto tariffs, he said he wouldn't do that in this case. \"This is permanent, 100%,\" he said.\n\nTrump made it clear that only cars and trucks made inside the U.S. are exempt from the tariff. He also appeared to indicate that his tariffs are also intended to impact the supply lines of American car companies, including General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, that see the vehicle assembly process move from plants in Canada and Mexico and ultimately back to the U.S. \"It's ridiculous,\" he said of the current supply system. \"This is a very simple system.\"\n\nAn aide said the tariffs are expected to produce $100 billion a year in revenue for the federal government. Trump pegged it at potentially more than six times that over two years.\n\nThe exact details of the tariffs must still be sorted out, but it appears there will be some exemptions.\n\nOn social media platform X, Harrison Fields, the White House principal deputy press secretary, acknowledged that while the tariff applies to “key automobile parts” including engines, transmissions, powertrain parts and electrical components, as well as assembled cars and trucks, parts compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement are “tariff-free” for now, though he didn’t say that USMCA-compliant vehicles receive the same treatment.\n\nThat was confirmed by U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor.\n\n\"People are still trying to understand what the impact will be but it appears at this moment in time USMCA-compliant vehicles and parts may not be subject\" to the tariffs in full at least for now, Dingell said.\n\nDingell also said she remains a supporter of using tariffs to make trade more fair and help bring manufacturing back to the U.S. “But we must allow the auto companies and parts suppliers the time they need to adjust,” she said.\n\nDingell said in a statement the announcement appears to \"be a step toward onshoring supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to our country,\" adding that she will work to support these goals. But, Dingell said, production changes can’t take place overnight.\n\n\"Our domestic auto industry relies on a closely integrated North American supply chain, which is why it’s important this includes exceptions for USMCA-compliant imports,\" Dingell said. \"However, it is time to renegotiate USMCA.”\n\nInitial reaction shows concern for higher new car prices\n\nIn an emergency news conference Wednesday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney condemned Trump's announcement as a \"direct attack\" on Canada's autoworkers.\n\n\"Even during a caretaker period of government, we have anticipated this possibility,\" said Carney, who has called a snap election for April 28 after taking over for Justin Trudeau. \"We have put in place the mechanisms where, if it is appropriate to put in place retaliatory tariffs ... we will take the steps that are in the interests of Canadian workers. We will fight in a unified way,\" he said. \"We are entirely aligned in terms of the seriousness we are taking this and the seriousness of our response.\"\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement Wednesday evening that the union applauds the move, and said the administration has made history \"for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.\"\n\n\"The UAW and the working class in general couldn’t care less about party politics; working people expect leaders to work together to deliver results,\" Fain said. \"The UAW has been clear: We will work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation’s history.\"\n\nFain said the tariffs are a big step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities and will help to bring union jobs back to the States. In addition to praising the Trump administration, the UAW called on U.S. automakers to swallow tariff costs on behalf of their shareholders, workers and customers.\n\n\"After they shift their supply chains and investments to the U.S., auto companies that have enjoyed years of record profits should absorb the cost of these tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers, and the UAW would support legislative or regulatory action requiring them to do so,\" the union said in the statement. \"Workers must be held harmless during any disruption that accompanies the reshoring process, with financial support from the federal government if necessary.\"\n\nDetroit automakers did not immediately provide a reaction to the news, but Autos Drive America, a group that represents the U.S. operations of international carmakers whose members collectively produce nearly half the vehicles made in the United States, issued a statement indicating concern that this move will raise new car prices.\n\n“At a time when cost is the number one concern for American car buyers, U.S. automakers are working to provide a range of affordable vehicles for consumers,” Jennifer Safavian, CEO of Autos Drive America, said in a statement. “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.”\n\nIn February 2025, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the United States was $48,039, a 1% increase from the year-ago period, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nParts makers, others trying to sort out what's included\n\nMegan Gardner, spokesperson for the group that represents auto parts suppliers, called MEMA, told the Free Press late Wednesday the group is reviewing a communication from the White House and is trying to determine the details and scope of the tariffs. It appears key automobile parts are included. MEMA will hold a meeting Thursday with the Trade Working Group to discuss the tariffs and provide a further analysis and comment after.\n\n“The biggest question to me that was not answered here was did he just rip up USMCA?” Catherine Karol, a Michigan-based attorney specializing in automotive legal issues at Detroit's Butzel law firm told the Detroit Free Press. “The number of imported vehicles to the U.S. is in the millions, and a large portion of those come from U.S. manufacturing plants in Mexico and Canada.”\n\nAuto industry analyst Joe McCabe provided the Free Press with a list of the automakers who produce vehicles or parts in Mexico and Canada and sell them in the states, all of whom will be impacted by this new tariff. In Mexico, there are: GM, Nissan, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, Honda, and Mazda. In Canada, there are: Toyota, Honda, Stellantis, GM and Ford.\n\nMcCabe said Trump's latest move did not provide clarity on the impact on parts production.\n\n\"Very short comments by the president on parts crossing borders (non-U.S.-built parts), but a lot of the language was about car sales,\" McCabe told the Free Press in an email.\n\nMcCabe who is president of AutoForecast Solutions said Trump is essentially applying a global chicken tax, which is an existing 25% tariff on imported trucks, across all vehicles now. With over 40% of the imported vehicles coming from Canada and Mexico, \"we do see some short/mid-term pain\" for many automakers.\n\nTrump's order apparently includes all foreign-made cars, bringing Japanese- and European-made cars into a discussion that previously focused on Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"It is very black and white when it comes to tracking a vehicle’s VIN,\" McCabe said. \"A lot more difficult if parts will be included. So we are waiting for more clarity on this topic, but we presume it will impact the suppliers, too.\"\n\nCox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating said vehicles impacted specifically from Canada and Mexico will be a lot of the U.S. auto market’s most affordable vehicles — the Ford Maverick, the Toyota RAV4, VW Jetta, Audi Q5 and several Mazda models. Additionally, vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax will also be impacted coming in from Korea.\n\n“Trump did say he would layer these costs on top of existing tariffs. Would those vehicles that already don’t comply with USMCA, already subject to 2.5% tariffs, now be subject to 27.5% tariffs?” she said. “That’s a question I would have for him.”\n\nThe history of tariffs this year\n\nOn the campaign trail ahead of November's election, Trump repeatedly praised tariffs as a way to rebalance trade, saying that other countries had long taken advantage of the U.S. On Feb. 1, he appeared to follow through with his promise, signing an order to impose 25% on most imports from Canada and Mexico, which, if enacted, threatened Michigan's auto industry.\n\nAnalysts estimated that, given a supply chain that sees components and auto assembly often crisscross North American borders almost a dozen times in the making of a single automobile, a new car cost could increase as much as $9,000 if not more, potentially crippling sales. Trump, however, argued that tariffs would not only force manufacturers to bring jobs back to the U.S. but also result in increased revenue for the federal government.\n\nBefore those Feb. 1 tariffs went into effect, Trump delayed them for a month until early March. Then, on March 5, just before they again were expected to be put in place, he announced a 30-day reprieve for U.S. automakers under the USMCA free trade agreement he signed into law during his first term. He then paused much of the other import tariffs he had threatened for other products covered by the USMCA.\n\nThat gave automakers a chance to try to get Trump and his administration to reconsider altogether, though the president went ahead with plans to hike tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, tariffs on Chinese imports and tariffs on any country that imported oil from Venezuela. He also promised a round of worldwide tariffs to reciprocate against those on U.S. goods from other countries beginning on April 2, a day he began to refer to as \"liberation day.\"\n\nIn Michigan, business leaders began to complain that rather than the boon they had hoped for from Trump's election, they were unsettled by an uncertain economic picture and worries about a possible recession. \"What we're hearing is it's beginning to look a lot like COVID,\" Detroit Regional Chamber Sandy Baruah said at a panel discussion this month, referring to the throttled supply lines, upended demand and confusion that came with the pandemic's outbreak five years ago. \"Business leaders are struggling with a level of uncertainty they weren’t expecting and weren’t planning for,\" he said.\n\nThe countries importing the most vehicles\n\nOn Monday, the Trump White House indicated that sector-specific tariffs might not be part of the April 2 announcement, and Trump said he might have something sooner to say on auto tariffs, though it was unclear at the time if he was talking about those from just Canada and Mexico or those worldwide. \"We’ll be announcing that fairly soon. Over the next few days, probably,\" the president said.\n\nAs for countries importing the most cars and light-duty trucks into the U.S. last year in terms of dollar-value, MichAuto, an association that works to promote and expand the industry, said they were Mexico ($50 billion), Japan ($41 billion), South Korea ($38 billion), Canada ($28 billion) and Germany ($25 billion).\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily take into account the value of all the various components and preliminary assemblies that move across the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada as part of the integrated supply chain for vehicles made especially by the Detroit automakers.\n\nFord Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley, for one, has stated his concern that imposing tariffs unilaterally on Mexico and Canada, where Ford gets a lot of its parts and makes some products, will unduly hurt its bottom line, despite the fact that 80% of its vehicles and all of its trucks are made in the U.S., while having a more limited impact on automakers based in South Korea, Japan and Europe.\n\nLast-ditch efforts\n\n\"Let's be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen,\" Farley said during a Wall Street event last month. \"Frankly, it gives free rein to South Korean, Japanese and European companies that are bringing 1.5 million to 2 million vehicles into the U.S. that wouldn't be subject to those Mexican and Canadian tariffs. It would be one of the biggest windfalls for those companies ever.\"\n\nIn an 11th-hour appeal to the White House this week, executives at Detroit automakers General Motors and Ford Motor Co. were either traveling to Washington, D.C. or meeting remotely with Trump administration officials to discuss the dire consequences tariffs could have on their companies. The Free Press learned earlier Wednesday that Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford was heading to the nation’s capital for a series of meetings with the administration.\n\nSimilarly, GM CEO and Chair Mary Barra was having remote meetings with Trump administration members. Information on both Ford's meetings as well as Barra's was according to four sources familiar with their plans. The people asked not to be named because they are not authorized to share the information publicly.\n\nIt was unclear what contact, if any, Stellantis had with the Trump administration ahead of the announcement. Spokespeople for all three automakers declined to comment on the record regarding any effort to soften, delay or deter tariffs.\n\nDetroit automakers had been regularly talking with or meeting in person with either Trump or his administration since earlier this month, the sources said. The meetings were also characterized as challenging for the automakers at times, as they attempted to educate administration officials on a complex manufacturing and supply chain that can be difficult for those outside the industry to understand, according to two of the sources.\n\nAuto executives have also explained how much it would impact their costs to have 25% tariffs in place on Canada and Mexico and that any efforts to relocate significant portions of their manufacturing base to the U.S. would take billions of dollars and years to do. On Wednesday, an analyst with Cox Automotive estimated that tariffs and the volatility they would cause could result in 700,000 fewer vehicles being sold in the U.S. this year.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Unlock unlimited digital access to floridatoday.com Click here and subscribe today.\n\nJust over seven decades after their deaths, Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore have been nominated for a Presidential Medal of Freedom for their roles in the civil rights struggle.\n\nCongressman Charlie Crist (D-St. Petersburg) nominated the Moores for the honor this week, calling on President Joe Biden to bestow the Medal of Freedom on the Moores for their \"contributions to our great nation.\"\n\nThe Moores — often referred to as the first martyrs of the Civil Rights Movement — were unjustly fired as teachers from Brevard County's still segregated school system in the 1940s for their work as activists.\n\nThe couple were killed after a bomb exploded under their home in Mims on Christmas Day, 1951. Many believe the bombing was in retaliation for the Moores' activism on behalf of the Groveland Four — four young Black men who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in Lake County. One of the men was killed by a mob while fleeing, another was shot and killed by Lake County's then-Sheriff Willis McCall while being taken to a hearing for a retrial. The other two were convicted. All four men, none of whom are still alive, were exonerated last year.\n\nNew curriculum in Brevard created: Harry T. and Harriet V. Moore honored by School Board resolution\n\nAfter the bomb exploded under the Moores' home in Mims, Harry Moore died after being driven to Sanford, the only place where a Black man could be hospitalized at the time. His wife died nine days later from injuries sustained in the blast.\n\nOnly in the past two years was the Moores' discriminatory termination by the school district acknowledged—and plans set in motion to institute a curriculum teaching Brevard County students about their lives and work. Likewise, their story has started to gain more attention.\n\nCrist's statement lauded the Moores as \"two of our state's greatest civil rights heroes, speaking out against segregation in Jim Crow-era Florida and demanding a voice for Black Floridians in our government and society.\"\n\n\"In the face of unspeakable discrimination and violence, the Moores organized and advocated for their fellow Black Floridians, bringing together a powerful coalition that would eventually help topple Jim Crow in the South and end the evils of segregation,\" Crist said.\n\nSonya Mallard, coordinator of the Moore Cultural Center in Mims, said that the honor was more than deserved for the work the Moores did paving the way for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n“We are very honored that our Congressman Charlie Crist has recognized the hard work of these iconic leaders, who were not just civil rights activists and worked hard for civil rights for African Americans and really all Americans, but as educators who continue through the Harry T. & Harriette V. Moore Cultural Center and Museum educating countless individuals daily,\" Mallard said in an emailed statement.\n\nNever completely forgotten: Brevard civil rights martyrs finally having their moment 70 years after their murder\n\n\"So, we are waiting in great anticipation that President Biden will bestow this great honor on these two great educators and civil rights leaders from the great State of Florida.”\n\nCrist is currently running as a Democrat for this year's gubernatorial election, hoping to unseat Gov. Ron DeSantis and win back the post he first held as a Republican from 2007 to 2011. He was entertaining his first (successful) bid in 2004 as Florida's then-attorney general when he reopened an investigation into the Moores' murders, which a prior extensive FBI investigation had failed to solve.\n\nThe result of the investigation ultimately pinned the deaths on four Orlando members of the Ku Klux Klan: Earl Brooklyn, Tillman Belvin, Joseph Cox, and Edward Spivey. Crist announced the findings at a news conference in Mims in 2006, weeks before the Republican primary. None of the four men were still alive.\n\nThe outcome has been roundly criticized by some of those who knew the Moores' story the best, including historian Ben Green, author of \"Before His Time: The Untold Story Of Harry T. Moore, America's First Civil Rights Martyr.\"\n\nThe conclusions were \"just ridiculous,\" Green told FLORIDA TODAY in previous interview. \"They just literally were like, pulling names out of hat so he didn't look foolish three weeks before the primary.\"\n\nIn a statement to FLORIDA TODAY last year, Crist said through a spokesperson that he \"stood by the work of our office and investigators.\"\n\n\"The Moore’s gave their lives in the fight for civil rights. It was important that the murderers were brought to justice, even if posthumously. It provided some closure for the family, lifting up the Moore’s legacy,” the statement read.\n\nTyler Vazquez is the North Brevard Watchdog Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Residents whose homes were destroyed evacuated to Bethel, the largest city in western Alaska, but shelters quickly filled up, requiring hundreds of people to be moved elsewhere.\n\nThe ongoing rescue operations were being carried out using multiple Blackhawk helicopters and other military aircraft. Along with the state's National Guard, the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, the Alaska Organized Militia, the Red Cross and the U.S. Coast Guard were participating in the rescue effort.\n\nAlaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy said on X that President Donald Trump was monitoring the situation. Dunleavy pledged to help those displaced by the storm, writing \"more help is on the way.\"\n\nAirlifts to continue for several days, Red Cross says\n\nThe American Red Cross said the storm forced the evacuation of as many as 2,000 people and damaged critical infrastructure, including roads, communication lines and air and seaport facilities.\n\nHundreds of Red Cross workers were deployed to Bethel and Anchorage to support residents whose homes were destroyed. The nonprofit also pledged to assist villagers without power or running water, especially those whose food has spoiled at the start of the winter season.\n\n\"This could be a prolonged relief operation lasting months as villages have been left inaccessible or unlivable as winter sets in,\" the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that air evacuations are \"expected to continue for several days.\"\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/30/helene-aftermath-live-updates-monday-north-carolina/75447978007/", "title": "Helene damage updates: Death toll rises amid rescue efforts", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene for Monday, Sept. 30. For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground: How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state. The agency has also supplied 40 Starlink satellites to help with responder communications, and 18 helicopters are on standby to help deliver additional resources to affected areas.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDevastation like a scene from 'War of the Worlds'\n\nResidents in parts of western North Carolina where help has not arrived are fending for themselves. Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need. Global relief organization World Central Kitchen began distributing free meals for the public on Monday. WCK is also providing meals in Florida and Georgia. The organization was founded by celebrity chef José Andrés in 2010 to provide fresh food on the frontlines of humanitarian disasters in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"Asheville, we are here,\" the group tweeted Monday. \"WCK is in North Carolina working to reach flooded communities and families stranded by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\n− Tiana Kennell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nWorry for neighbors amid communication blackouts\n\nIn Burnsville, North Carolina, Suzanne Vale on Monday posted the names of her neighbors in a group Facebook chat in hopes someone knows how they’re doing. She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived. So, like others in the area, he first grabbed his chainsaw to help clear roads and check on neighbors.\n\n\"The whole side of the mountain came down,\" he said. \"Then it filled up the valley with mud.\" Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nNorth Carolina town bands together: 'That's what we do'\n\nHelicopters, thermal drones used in some rescues\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, said his international security firm has supported and evacuated over 400 people from disaster areas across the Southeast. Some of the rescues required helicopters and even thermal drones, he said.\n\n\"While we’ve seen the highest demand from clients in the North Carolina region, we are actively conducting wellness checks and delivering food and water supplies along the storm’s path,\" he said. \"The devastation ... and its impact will be felt for months to come.\"\n\nDid the historic Biltmore Estate flood from Helene?\n\nThe Biltmore Estate in Asheville is assessing damage and will remain temporarily closed because of \"significant flooding, impassable roads and widespread power outages in our region,\" according to a statement on the social media account for the historic house and museum. Museum officials were asking people to check biltmore.com/weather-update for the latest. As of Sunday, a message on the website said officials were \"working to reopen\" but provided no timeline.\n\nGeorge Vanderbilt’s 250-room French Renaissance château, which took six years to build in the late 19th century, was the \"largest undertaking in residential architecture in the nation,\" according to the estate website. The home contains more than four acres of floor space, 35 bedrooms, 43 bathrooms and 65 fireplaces.

The clam farmer worries about impact on his harvest. And the business leader contemplates what Mother Nature will throw at them next as the climate changes.\n\nTens of thousands of residents of Florida’s Big Bend region are confronting the same fears in the wake of Hurricane Helene. And those feelings are increasingly shared by coastal residents from Alaska to California and Maine as stronger, more frequent storms and rising ocean levels upend their lives and livelihoods. Many insurers already have curtailed coverage or withdrawn entirely from some areas, indicating the long-term risk.\n\n“Natural disasters are natural disasters,” said innkeeeper Ian Maki, who has lived through five hurricanes since moving to the island community southwest of Gainesville in 2018. “But these don’t feel natural anymore.” Read more here.\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nAnxious relatives gather outside emergency room\n\nPeople waited outside the emergency room at HCA Healthcare’s Mission Hospital in Asheville, checking the conditions of relatives who had been admitted. Shawn Hensley, 47, of Black Mountain, told the Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, his 65-year-old mother arrived at the hospital the night before because she was running low on oxygen. Hensley and neighbors had to chainsaw a tree blocking his car so he could get out of his neighborhood.\n\n“It looks like Mother Nature just stomped all over that little town,” Hensley said. “It’s just destruction everywhere you look.”\n\nBiden expected to visit the region affected by Helene\n\nBiden plans to visit the areas ravaged by Helene this week once he can do so without disrupting emergency services, the White House said.\n\n\"It's tragic,\" Biden told reporters on Sunday, pledging recovery assistance after declaring major disasters in Florida and North Carolina and emergencies for Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. \"You saw the photographs. It's stunning.\"\n\nTrump planned to visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to receive a briefing on storm damage, his campaign said.\n\nMore storms developing in Atlantic Basin\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is tracking five systems in the Atlantic basin. The biggest concern to Florida and the U.S. is a disturbance in the Caribbean Sea, which could become a tropical depression later this week as it follows a path similar to major Hurricane Helene. Forecasters are advising residents along the Gulf Coast to closely monitor the system.\n\nAnother system, Tropical Storm Kirk, was expected to become a \"large and powerful\" system later this week, the hurricane center said. Current models show it curving north into the middle of the Atlantic, well away from the U.S. Read more here.\n\n– Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

Col. Ellis Parks.\n\nAmong those helicoptered to safety: an infant, a patient with dementia and others in need of hospital care.\n\nNorth Carolina Guardsmen were assisted by personnel and choppers from states including Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, Parks said Monday. The National Guard has airlifted 100,000 pounds of water and food.\n\nMeanwhile the Federal Emergency Management Agency was in “surge” mode, deploying 3,500 workers to work with local, state and federal officials. Another 1,200 were conducting search and rescue missions targeting the hardest-hit areas of North Carolina and Tennessee, a senior FEMA official told USA TODAY.\n\nHelene reached its peak as a Category 4 storm, and then dumped massive amounts of water on the mountains bridging eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, that carried away homes, businesses, roads and bridges. As many as 600 people were still unaccounted for on Monday, President Joe Biden said.\n\nIn a statement Monday afternoon, Biden confirmed the enormity of the evolving federal effort to provide drinking water, food, power and working toilets – and to reopen roads and clear downed trees and power lines.\n\n“I have directed my team to provide every available federal resource as fast as possible to communities hit by Hurricane Helene,” Biden said, adding that he has “quickly approved every Emergency Declaration request” he has received from the states and deployed FEMA and Small Business Administration teams to help residents whose homes or businesses were destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe federal search and rescue teams, Biden said, “were working side-by-side with state and local partners in treacherous conditions to find those who are missing.

For the latest on the storm, see our story for Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nST. MARKS, Fla. – Helene weakened to a post-tropical cyclone as it swept through the Southeast on Friday but the storm still wielded enough power to inflict historic flooding across multiple states, causing 39 deaths and millions of power outages.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, with 140-mph winds, making it the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. Overturned boats, flattened homes and a vista of floodwater several-feet-deep were revealed at dawn across the storm-weary region.\n\nIn Steinhatchee, a coastal town just miles from where Helene made landfall, John Kujawski drove a golf cart with his wife, Jamie Lee, over debris and around downed trees, horrified at the damage. The town of some 500 people took on 9.63 feet of storm surge, a record.\n\n“This is overwhelming,” Lee said. “I don’t think it’s sunk in.”\n\nMoody's Analytics estimated the storm will cost $15 to 26 billion in property damage, much of it spanning across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nFor several hours, the storm maintained hurricane strength as it pushed inland across northern Florida and into Georgia. By 5 p.m. ET, the weather service said Helene had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm crossed into Kentucky and was about 50 miles south-southeast of Louisville.\n\nFlash flood emergencies and warnings were active Friday night in Tennessee, Virginia, Ohio and the Carolinas. The weather service urged residents in danger zones to stay off the roads and seek higher road, warning that life-threatening flash floods could continue in some areas until Saturday morning.\n\nHundreds of water rescues were underway across the Southeast amid the torrential rain and continued coastal flooding in western Florida. Meanwhile, more than 4 million utility customers were without power from Florida to Virginia.\n\nTrack the storm: Map Helene's forecast path through Georgia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters 115 structures in the southern Georgia city of Valdosta had been heavily damaged by Helene's high winds, and crews were responding to rescue people trapped inside.\n\n∎ Widespread flooding and a mudslide shut down a long stretch of Interstate 40 Friday afternoon, extending between Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\n∎ Helene is tied as the 14th most powerful hurricane to hit anywhere in the U.S. since records have been kept and the seventh most powerful to slam into Florida, according to National Hurricane Center data.\n\n∎ Federal Emergency Management Agency teams were on the ground in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas Friday. President Joe Biden had approved emergency declarations for all five states ahead of Helene's landfall in anticipation of the storm's sprawling impact.\n\n∎ More than 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, and 28,500 were delayed by late Friday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website.\n\nHelene wrecks dozens of homes in Florida beach town\n\nHelene wrecked dozens of homes across Horseshoe Beach, a tiny beach town and fishing destination in Florida's Big Bend that has been hit by several hurricanes in recent years.\n\nSome houses were shoved off their concrete footings, while others had their roofs flayed off. The wind and water also tumbled docks onto land, tore down chain-link fences and snapped telephone poles.\n\nBill and Debbie Dotson erected a tent beneath their home Friday where they planned to camp after the storm ripped their staircases away, blocking access to the otherwise undamaged house roughly 20 feet off the ground. Helene was their fourth hurricane since moving to the coastal town in 2021.\n\n“We sure are grateful that it’s standing,” Debbie Dotson, 63, said.\n\nLike many homes in Horseshoe Beach, theirs is built atop concrete footings to keep them out of the flood waters. Idalia destroyed about 40 houses, and the Dotsons said they thought this storm caused more damage.\n\nBill Dotson, 67, said he gauged the floodwaters at around 15 feet, based on the damage to the top of his concrete pilings. Last year, Idalia destroyed one staircase and damaged the other. A local contractor had only recently finished rebuilding both sets for $15,000.\n\n“We came out here and saw this beauty and wanted to go fishing in our retirement,” Debbie Dotson said. “We had the discussion about hurricanes, but you never imagine something like this. You just don’t.”\n\n– Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nNorth Carolina city under curfew amid widespread power outages\n\nThe western North Carolina city of Asheville that largely remained in the dark late Friday was under nightly curfews for the next two days in an effort to prevent residents from accidentally wandering into rising waters, police announced.\n\n“We are unequivocally in the most significant natural disaster of our lifetime here in Buncombe County, and maybe in history,” said Buncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole.\n\nThe French Broad River, which flows more than 200 miles from North Carolina to Tennessee, broke previous historic records Friday. The river reached nearly 25 feet in the late afternoon, breaking the July 16, 1916, record of 23.1 feet, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.\n\nNearly 70% of Buncombe County, including Asheville, was out of power as of 10 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker. There have been more than 130 water rescues in Buncombe County, and nearly 200 firefighters were actively responding to calls just in Asheville, a city of roughly 95,000 people.\n\n– Contributing: Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDam failure in Tennessee prompting emergency evacuations was false alarm\n\nA reported \"catastrophic\" dam failure that triggered an emergency evacuation for the entire downtown area of Newport, Tennessee, Friday afternoon was a false alarm, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nCocke County officials urged all residents to flee the area around 3 p.m. ET Friday after reports that Walters Dam had failed. State emergency management officials said around 4:40 p.m. that Duke Energy, which owns and operates the dam, informed them it was still standing.\n\n\"There is no longer a risk of an imminent dam failure for Walters Dam on the Pigeon River,\" the National Weather Service office in Morristown confirmed on X at 4:45 p.m. \"Major flooding continues, however. Continue to heed evacuation orders from local emergency management and law enforcement. Do not drive into flooded or closed roads.\"\n\nThe dam scare comes as nearby rivers continue to rise from the effects of Helene. The Pigeon River at Newport rose to nearly three times its flood stage Friday afternoon, and it's expected to reach 23 feet before receding this evening.\n\n– Tyler Whetstone and Allison Kiehl, the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\n'We have nothing': Florida home washed away by Helene\n\nFrom the posts she saw on Facebook about her Steinhatchee neighborhood, Lynn Padgett knew the damage might be dire at the house she’s called home for 41 of her 48 years.\n\nShe just didn’t expect it would not be where she had left it Thursday.\n\nThe house was located in a riverside neighborhood alongside other homes. Helene's surge of water pushed it off its foundation and relocated it to the edge of a wooded area just down the way.\n\n\"This is the fourth time the river has flooded (the house) and the first time it’s washed my house away,” she said, chuckling, as she sat in her car with five Dachshunds and a cat. Another cat, Muffin, had climbed up a tree in fright.\n\nShe’s not laughing because it’s funny; not only does the Jiffy Food stop manager’s home not have flood insurance, but it’s not insured for wind either.\n\nThe Jiffy store she works at in Steinhatchee is flooded out, too, she said. She was waiting in her car, hoping the water would go down enough so she could get to her house where she lived with her husband, 64; her father, 67, who uses a wheelchair; and her 18-year-old son.\n\n“Laugh, cry, I don’t know what to do,” she said. “We have nothing.”\n\n-Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nDozens rescued from roof of hospital 'engulfed' by floodwater\n\nMore than 50 patients and staff were rescued after being stranded on a hospital rooftop as floodwaters quickly rose at Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee, on Friday afternoon, Sen. Bill Hagerty said.\n\n\"Everyone has been rescued safely from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin,\" he said. \"More trouble on the horizon for East Tennessee communities. Please stay safe and thank you for your prayers!\"\n\nFloodwaters from the rapidly rising Nolichucky River and high winds prevented ambulances, rescue boats and even helicopters from reaching the hospital earlier, according to a statement from Ballad Health.\n\n\"The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water. The situation at the hospital is very dangerous,\" the statement said.\n\nBallad Health said that at about 12:30 p.m., 54 people were on the roof and seven were in rescue boats. Water has also intruded into the hospital, the statement said. The rescue was complete by about 4:15 p.m., according to Hagerty's post.\n\nVirginia State Police said its aviation units were helping with the rescues and posted a photo on social media showing the building surrounded by high floodwaters.\n\nBig Bend resident maintains resolve to build back up after Helene\n\nHer riverside home is destroyed, eight of the 24 riverside rental units she owns were flooded, and the electrical system powering the riverside marina building may have been fritzed.\n\nAnd still, Danielle Norwood, 59, owner of the Sea Hag Marina that fronts the Steinhatchee River, was smiling somehow as she pointed to a concrete floor that had crumbled.\n\n“I think I’m stunned at this point, I can’t release a lot of emotions,” she said. And then she paused.\n\n“We’ll build back,\" she said. \"We’re those kind of people.”\n\nThe build-back is familiar territory for Norwood. Last year's Hurricane Idalia destroyed $1 million worth of docks and flooding shorted out the building's electrical system. To avoid a repeat, Norwood moved the electrical system to a second floor in the building, but Helene's nearly 10-foot storm surge appears to have shorted it again.\n\nOn the floor below, a wooden bar was still standing; however, the TVs above it had a line across the screen showing how far the water had risen.\n\nThe good news for Norwood is that Helene's fury spared the feral cats who prowl the marina grounds — and the docks that were so badly torn up by Idalia.\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nOver 4 million homes and businesses across the eastern U.S. were in the dark Friday night as Helene pummeled the region with powerful winds and heavy rain.\n\nBelow are the outage totals from Florida to Virginia as of 10 p.m., according to the USA TODAY power outage tracker.\n\nSouth Carolina: 1,031,187\n\nGeorgia: 898,176\n\nFlorida: 527,152\n\nNorth Carolina: 748,112\n\nVirginia: 204,561\n\nKentucky: 158,164\n\nTennessee: 66,032\n\nWest Virginia: 71,969\n\nFlorida power outage map: Track widespread outages from Helene in the state\n\nFlorida sheriff says coastal area looks like 'a war zone' in Helene's wake\n\nOfficials in Florida's Pinellas County – hundreds of miles from where Helene came ashore – painted a grim picture when describing the storm's impact on its coast.\n\n“I would just describe it, having spent the last few hours out there, as a war zone,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Friday morning.\n\nHe said roads were impassable and that debris and damage were widespread: \"It’s going to take awhile before that area gets back to any sense of functionality.”\n\nAlong the Pinellas County coast, storm surge overnight reached over 8 feet – ”something we’ve never seen before” said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nDeath toll rises as Helene batters Southeast\n\nAt least 39 people have died as Helene unleashed dangerous weather conditions across multiple states in the Southeast, according to authorities and media reports. Officials have said they expect the death toll to keep rising as they go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nIn Florida, at least seven deaths have been attributed to the storm. In Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference Friday that 11 people were killed during the storm, including a first responder.\n\n\"One of our finest lost his life trying to save others,\" Kemp said.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 19 storm-related fatalities across six counties, Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for the governor's office, told USA TODAY Friday evening.\n\nOf those, two people were killed by trees that had fallen on their homes, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and coroner's office told local media outlets. Two firefighters in Saluda County were also killed, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Two people died in Newberry County, Sheriff James Lee Foster said in an email. Four others died in Aiken County, Coroner Darryl Ables told USA TODAY by phone.\n\nIn North Carolina, a 4-year-old was killed and others were injured in a wreck on Thursday that occurred as Helene's outer bands were slamming the state. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a person died and another was hospitalized after a tree fell on a home just after 5 a.m. Friday, according to the Charlotte Fire Department.\n\n“This was a storm related death,” Battalion Chief John Lipcsak, a spokesperson for the fire department, told USA TODAY.\n\nPotential dam failure triggers evacuations in North Carolina\n\nIn Rutherford County, North Carolina, officials issued evacuation orders after major flooding in the area pushed a dam to the brink of failure.\n\nRutherford County Emergency Management on Friday morning announced that \"catastrophic\" flows of water along the Broad River began overtopping the Lake Lure Dam, located about 35 miles southeast of Asheville. As a result, a mandatory evacuation order was issued impacting areas downstream, including River Creek Campground and homes in the Green Hill, Cleghorn and Union communities.\n\n\"RESIDENTS BELOW THE LAKE LURE DAM NEED TO EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\" county emergency officials warned on Facebook. \"DAM FAILURE IMMINIENT!! EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\"\n\nPower outages, road closures abound in North Carolina, Georgia\n\nTowns across the Carolinas and north-central Georgia were battered through Friday morning as Helene swept over the region, leaving entire parts of Atlanta underwater and triggering evacuation warnings.\n\n“All the apps on my phone kept screaming that there were flash flood warnings all night,” said Paul Thatcher, 38, owner of Franklin Terrace Bed and Breakfast in Franklin, North Carolina, about 70 miles southwest of Asheville.\n\nA nearby mountain highway was ordered closed Friday because the edge of the road bank eroded away, causing the edge of the asphalt to break away, sliding down the valley, officials in Macon County, North Carolina, said on Facebook.\n\nIn Elberton, Georgia, near the state’s border with South Carolina, the Samuel Elbert Hotel lost power overnight and regained it around 10 a.m. Friday, front desk associate Deborah Morrison told USA TODAY.\n\nOn her way to work Friday morning, Morrison said she saw four homes damaged by fallen trees. One road in town was completely washed out around 6 a.m., and other roads were closed because of downed power lines or trees, she said. Traffic on some roads had to alternate using a single lane in either direction, leading to lines of cars, Morrison said.\n\n“Everybody’s weathered it pretty fair, there’s no panicking going on,” Morrison, 63, said.\n\nHurricanes can produce tornadoes for days\n\nAs Helene tore through the Southeast on Friday, tornadoes were a growing concern.\n\nWhile tornadoes don’t typically get the same attention as hurricanes' ferocious winds or perilous storm surge, twisters are always one of the clear and present dangers as storms make landfall and trek inland.\n\n\"Hurricanes can produce tornadoes for two or three days after they move inland,\" said Roger Edwards, a lead forecaster at the Storm Prediction Center, who specializes in tornadoes. The highest risk warning the center has ever issued for a tornado situation related to a hurricane was for the third day after Hurricane Ivan made landfall in Alabama in September 2004. Forecasters were confident there would be a lot of super cells in Virginia, Maryland and even in the southern Pennsylvania area.\n\nNOAA posted a tornado watch at 8:05 a.m. for portions of North Carolina, Eastern South Carolina, Southern Virginia and coastal areas nearby until at least 6 p.m. Friday. The tornado threat from Helene would shift northward, through an area about 110 miles on either side of a line from 40 miles west-southwest of Florence, South Carolina to 20 miles northeast of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the agency said.\n\nSevere thunderstorms with hail were also possible, the agency said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nCoastal Florida town slammed by hurricane – again\n\nBefore Friday morning’s light showed boats in yards, homes shredded and docks thrown from the river into roads, 22 members of the Florida State Guard Special Missions Unit were wading through the mud on the south side of Steinhatchee River’s banks, looking for anyone who needed rescuing.\n\nHurricane Helene struck Thursday evening, making landfall not far away in Perry. In Steinhatchee on Friday, what was dry land only hours earlier was submerged in 40 to 50 inches of water, said Jordon Bowen, commander of the unit, as he gazed down a road that now looked more like a river.\n\n“We have four different skiffs cruising through the neighborhood,” Bowen said, scanning the southeast side of Steinhatchee. “We’re searching all the area to make sure no one’s out there.”\n\nSo far, no one needed help. The search effort also included the National Guard, the Coast Guard, Taylor County sheriffs and Florida Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 2. However, the overall situation looks bleak, according to Bowen.\n\n“It’s destroyed,” Bowen said, indicating an area that’s about the size of 27 football fields. “Not accessible, debris, lots of hazards, downed power lines, houses cut in half.\"\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nPerry resident: 'I've had worse'\n\nOutside Perry, Florida, longtime resident Donna Parker, 80, watched as her grandson cut up a toppled palm tree with a chainsaw.\n\nParker has lived in her house since 1985 and has never left for a hurricane, the names of which she can still rattle off.\n\n\"The wind, it was bad. But I’ve had worse. We’ve really had worse. I’ve had it where my whole front yard was a lake,” she said.\n\n“A lot of prayers, I tell you, when the wind come up. But the good Lord looked after us.”\n\nIs there another hurricane brewing after Helene?\n\nWhile Helene was smashing into Florida, a new hurricane was coming to life in the Atlantic. Hurricane Isaac formed Friday morning far out in the ocean, almost 1,000 miles from Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nAlthough the hurricane is moving east across the open Atlantic far from land, swells generated by Isaac are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and could spread into the Azores by this weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nElsewhere, forecasters were also watching a weather disturbance in the central Atlantic Ocean, one that has a 90% chance of becoming a named storm within the next couple of days. \"A tropical depression or storm could form today while the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"The system is then forecast to slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend.\"\n\nIf it gets a name, it would be called Tropical Storm Joyce. As of Friday morning, the system poses no threat to any land areas.\n\nFinally, ominously, forecasters were also turning their attention back to the Caribbean Sea, where yet another system appears to be brewing in a similar location to where Hurricane Helene formed. \"Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development while the system moves generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by the end of next week,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThat system, if it strengthens to a storm, would be called Tropical Storm Kirk.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nMan and his dog rescued from sailboat, taken to hospital\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, a U.S. Coast Guard Air Station crew rescued a man and his dog after his sailboat became disabled and started taking on water off the Florida coast.\n\nCrews found the disabled boat 25 miles off the island's coast after a mayday call came in Thursday.\n\nA photo posted on X shows the Coast Guard rescuing the pair near a disabled vessel as high waters swirl around them.\n\nOfficials said the boater and the dog were airlifted to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.\n\nThe storm came the closest to the barrier island around 3 p.m. Thursday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\nIs Disney World closed for Hurricane Helene?\n\nTheme park-goers awaited official updates Friday morning announcing what parts of Walt Disney World may be closed.\n\nWalt Disney World in Orlando was open Thursday, but a few parts of the massive theme park were closed because of to Hurricane Helene, including the Typhoon Lagoon water park and miniature golf course. Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party was also canceled for Thursday, the Fort Myers News-Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nDisney World has closed less than a dozen times for hurricanes and national emergencies since its opening in 1971, according to the News-Press.\n\nTampa Bay residents say Helene inflicted 'complete devastation'\n\nIn Tampa Bay, residents said they saw vanished beaches, boats that ran into homes and businesses on fire.\n\n\"Complete devastation and loss here,\" Vikki Hudson, who lives in Largo about three miles from the coast, told USA TODAY on Friday. \"The beaches are gone. Everything is under water. Boats pilled on top of houses and yards.\"\n\nHudson said Gulf Boulevard, which runs the St. Petersburg coastline from Pass-A-Grille historic district north to Clearwater, was \"completely under water.\"\n\nHudson, who lives about 20 minutes from Treasure Island Beach where her two businesses are − The Island Girl Tiki Bar and The Island Girl Beach Rentals − said she has not been able to check on either because bridges are closed because of widespread flooding.\n\n\"We don’t know anything yet, we cannot get to any of the barrier islands,\" Hudson said.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\n'The worst I’ve seen': Water rescues underway across Florida\n\nAuthorities in communities up and down the west coast of Florida said they were conducting water rescues on Friday as storm surge continued to inundate coastal areas.\n\nIn Pasco County, communications manager Tambrey Lane, said state and local agencies working together had rescued at least 135 people from rising waters as of 7:30 a.m. Friday, though she added that number might be as high as 200 or more.\n\nCrews were still out as of 8:30 a.m. and rescues were ongoing, Lane said, and some areas remained inaccessible to rescue crews. More than 54,000 homes were under a mandatory evacuation order west of Interstate 19 and about 4,000 more homes east of the highway.\n\n“It’s really bad,” said Michelle Welsh, an emergency communications officer with the county. “I think it’s the worst I’ve seen.”\n\nWelsh, who’s lived in the area since 2007, said her single-wide trailer had no power, but her home, fortunately, was intact.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan, USA TODAY\n\nFlorida city powers down sewage plant, asks residents not to flush or shower\n\nResidents in a section of St. Petersburg, a city of 261,000, were told not to flush toilets or take showers after the city shut off power at a sewer treatment plant.\n\nThe city said it made the “difficult decision” in order to “protect the plant from unprecedented storm surge,\" in a statement released Friday morning.\n\n“Impacted residents/businesses should not drain water, take showers, do laundry or flush toilets,” the city said. “Draining water will cause sewage to back up into homes/businesses.”\n\nMorning light reveals damage in the wake of Helene\n\nDawn broke Friday morning over a battered and sudden Big Bend region of Florida after hurricane Helene roared ashore overnight.\n\nThe sharp smell of pine filled the air, an artifact of the hundreds of snapped trees lining roads between St. Marks and Perry. Emergency workers flooding into the area, wove around downed trees along U.S Highway 98 as sheriff deputies, limited access, and patrolled for possible looting.\n\nIn the tiny community of St. Marks, about 20 miles south of Tallahassee, floodwaters had reached the front of the U.S Post Office building, about 3/10 of a mile from the St. Marks River, which flows into the Gulf a few miles downstream.Some residents had planned to ride out the storm in their homes or aboard fishing boats tied up at the marina. They could not be immediately reached Friday morning, although cellphone service in the area was working.\n\nRescues ongoing in Atlanta as Helene drenches Southeast\n\nAuthorities in the Atlanta metro area conducted rescues early Friday as Helene raced through the state, drenching a vast swath of the Southeast in multiple inches of rain.\n\nAbout 25 people were rescued from a flooded apartment complex north of downtown Atlanta, multiple outlets reported, citing the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.\n\nNearby Peachtree Creek entered major flood stage, reaching a height of more than 23 feet. Flood watches and warnings were active across the state of Georgia, where all counties are under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nAbout 4-6 inches of rain have fallen throughout north-central Georgia, including Atlanta and its surrounding counties, according to the weather service in Peachtree City, south of Atlanta. Forecasters say an additional 2 inches could fall throughout the morning hours.\n\nHundreds took to shelters in Tallahassee ahead of Helene\n\nAmber Handlin sat in front of her Lab mix Duckey in a makeshift shelter at the Leon High School gym. They were among the 546 people and 60 pets were in Leon County shelters Thursday afternoon.\n\nHandlin lives in her car and has no friends or family nearby, and with several counties in the area under mandatory evacuation orders, she and the dog were both anxious as the storm approached.\n\nSydney Walter, Jacob Walsh and 1-year-old Graylan live near Florida State University's campus. \"We're like nope, we are not even going to try it,\" Walter said. \"I said, I have a baby so I'm not risking anything.”\n\nThe family, which is expecting a new member, decided to shelter at Leon's gym, citing its proximity to their home, the security it offers − and the most persuasive push, the mom said, was Gov. Ron DeSantis' encouragement.\n\n– Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nRead the full story: Public schools sheltering local evacuees from Helene\n\nNational weather radar\n\nFlorida boaters ride out Hurricane Helene\n\nAs Helene pummeled northwest Florida with over 100 mph winds and surges of water several feet high, Philip Tooke managed to punch out a terse but frantic message from his phone as he sat riding out the storm – not in his house, but on his boat.\n\n“Lost power,” he wrote from St. Mark’s, 30 miles south of Tallahassee and 20 miles away from where Hurricane Helene hit the mouth of the Aucilla River.

Hundreds were feared trapped by high water, and neighbors used boats to rescue one another.\n\nOcracoke Island was inundated with storm surge, causing what some residents described as \"catastrophic\" flooding, Gov. Roy Cooper said in a Friday afternoon news conference.\n\nAbout 800 people remained on the island during the hurricane, he said.

Residents wishing to leave are also being airlifted, and a shelter in Washington County has been opened for them.\n\nNorth Carolina National Guard Maj. Gen. James Ernst said six missions have been flown to the barrier islands, including four resupply trips and an aerial reconnaissance mission.\n\nFerry operations to the barrier islands should resume on Saturday, according to North Carolina Department of Transportation director Jim Trogdon.\n\nAbout 4,500 people stayed in shelters overnight in North Carolina and more than 70 roads were impassable, Cooper said. A number of tornadoes touched down Thursday, too, he said, and while there were no serious injuries, there was significant damage.\n\nA Red Cross shelter on Elizabeth City State University's campus lost power around 8 a.m. Friday. It's using a generator to get by while parts of Elizabeth City wait for power to be restored.\n\nShelter manager Jim Wolfe, 72, said the center is housing 74 people. \"Their concern is whether they'll be able to get back to a house before too long. Whether their house is under water or that type of thing,\" he said.\n\nA weather station at Hatteras High School reported sustained winds at 77 mph and gusts up to 89 mph, the hurricane center said earlier Friday.\n\nWilmington saw heavy rainfall with as much as 15 inches in isolated patches. Trees bent in the wind and traffic lights swayed.\n\nOn Atlantic Beach, oceanside homes that were rocked by Hurricane Florence last year stood with a few bruises but mostly intact.\n\nJanice Bynum, owner of the Tackle Box Tavern, said she's closed just twice in the past 35 years. She kept the doors open Thursday night up to the edge of curfew and reopened Friday with help from a crowd of regular customers, a generator and a half ton of ice.\n\n\"I only close for hurricanes, but I don't close for (Category) 2's,\" Bynum said. \"I stayed awake all night and about 3 a.m., everything kicked into a new gear. I'm just happy it's nothing like last year (when Florence hit). We are still open, and the beer is still cold.\"\n\nIn Morehead City, shuttered business lined both sides of U.S. Highway 70 as a few cars and trucks crawled along. The town remained under a curfew until 3 p.m.\n\nThe only activity? At that Southern mainstay, the local Waffle House. \"I slept through the whole thing,\" said Ted Nowell, who lives in the Morehead City area. \"Power didn’t even go out until about 7:30 (a.m.).\"\n\nUp to 7 feet of storm surge is possible from Salter Path to Duck, and parts of southeastern Virginia could see up to 4 feet of storm surge, the NHC says.\n\nConsider this: Dorian is cranking up tornadoes along the Carolina coasts\n\nThe storm formed tornadoes in South Carolina, too, ripping off roofs and flipping trailers Thursday. A quarter of a million homes and businesses were left without power.\n\n\"People have to realize it’s not just about the center\" of the storm, said Ken Graham, director of the hurricane center. \"You have to look at the whole storm.\"\n\nHowever, from the Lowcountry to the Grand Strand, there was a sigh of relief as potentially historic flash floods did not overwhelm.\n\nHistoric downtown Charleston did see up to a foot of water on some streets Thursday, and gusts reached up to 80 mph in some areas. But Mayor John Tecklenburg said in a tweet that during the city's recovery efforts, \"I'm counting our blessings.\"\n\nThe fears of seawater overtopping the walls of The Battery and torrential rainfall leaving the city underwater proved unfounded, as water in the streets leveled off Friday morning.\n\nFrom Charleston to Myrtle Beach, the highest wind speeds clocked in at 87 mph at Winyah Bay, a coastal area of Georgetown in between. Rainfall totaled 11 inches in areas of Georgetown County, about 7 inches in Myrtle Beach and just over 5 inches measured at the Charleston airport.\n\nA Jeep was mysteriously abandoned on the Myrtle Beach shore early Thursday, quickly gaining an audience at the beach and online, with Twitter transforming it into a tongue-in-cheek storm mascot.\n\nIt remained there, wobbling in the waves Friday at sunrise.\n\nAt least four deaths have been attributed to Dorian in the mainland U.S., which all involved men who died in falls or were electrocuted while preparing for the storm in Florida and North Carolina.\n\nThe storm will be southeast of southeastern New England Friday evening and in Nova Scotia by Saturday, the NHC said. The Canadian Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for eastern Nova Scotia from Hubbards to Avonport.\n\nEarlier, Dorian devastated the Bahamas with 185-mph winds, leaving at least 30 people dead, after its slow trek through the Caribbean. The storm decimated much of Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands: Homes were leveled, cars were flipped, trees were uprooted and, horrifically, children were swept away in the storm surge.\n\nAt one point, the threat of a major hurricane making landfall along Florida's east coast loomed, but the storm lurched north instead, staying 60 to 80 miles offshore as it passed by.\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis said the death toll was expected to rise as storm rescue workers scour islands.\n\nThe Bahamian government sent hundreds of police and marines into the stricken islands, along with doctors, nurses and other health care workers. The U.S. Coast Guard, Britain’s Royal Navy and relief organizations, including the United Nations and the Red Cross, joined the growing effort to rush food and medicine to survivors and lift the most desperate people to safety by helicopter.\n\nThe hurricane also caused a significant oil spill at a petroleum storage terminal on Grand Bahama Island, according to Associated Press reporting Friday evening.\n\nSatellite images taken Friday show a slick of black oil seeping from the South Riding Point terminal.\n\nEquinor is the facility’s owner. In a statement, it said its initial aerial assessment showed the seaside terminal had sustained damage and oil has been observed on the ground outside of the onshore tanks. The company said it was “too early” to estimate how much oil might have spilled into the surrounding environment, but that there were “no observations of any oil spill at sea.”\n\nThe terminal’s tanks can hold 6.75 million barrels of crude oil and condensate. The facility was shut down Saturday as the Category 5 storm approached the island.\n\nEquinor said it has mobilized oil spill response resources that will arrive “as soon as possible.”\n\nEquinor is an international oil company that is majority-owned by the Norwegian government.\n\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez, John Bacon, Trevor Hughes and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Brian Gordon, Asheville Citizen Times; Eric Connor and Carol Motsinger, The Greenville News; The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/29/katrina-camille-factor-saved-cost-lives/71339680/", "title": "Katrina: Camille factor saved, cost lives", "text": "by Geoff Pender\n\nOn Aug. 24, 2005, a depression strengthened west of the Bahamas and was named Tropical Storm Katrina, an inauspicious start to the worst natural disaster in U.S. and\n\nMississippi history.\n\nThe next day, Hurricane Katrina became a killer, blamed for 14 deaths and $500 million in damage as it crossed the southern tip of Florida. It entered the warm waters of the Gulf and began to strengthen and grow.\n\nThen it headed for Mississippi.\n\nThe ‘Camille factor’\n\n“URGENT … DEVASTATING DAMAGE EXPECTED … HURRICANE KATRINA … RIVALING THE INTENSITY OF HURRICANE CAMILLE OF 1969 … MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS PERHAPS LONGER … AT LEAST HALF OF WELL CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE … THE MAJORITY OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS WILL BECOME NON FUNCTIONAL … AIRBORNE DEBRIS WILL BE WIDESPREAD … PERSONS PETS AND LIVESTOCK EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL FACE CERTAIN DEATH IF STRUCK … POWER OUTAGES WILL LAST FOR WEEKS … WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS … DO NOT VENTURE OUTSIDE!” – excerpts of National Weather Service warning, 10:11 a.m. on Sunday, Aug. 28, 2005. Known as “The Bulletin,” it’s the most dire weather alert the agency has ever issued.\n\nThe Mississippi Coast has a “hurricane culture.” Brenda, Ethel, Betsy, Frederic, Elena, Opal, Georges … the area has been hit or brushed by storms more than 50 times in the last 140 years.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Camille in 1969, the second strongest hurricane to make U.S. landfall in recorded history.\n\nThe Category 5 Camille flattened the Mississippi Coast. It became the benchmark, or worst-case scenario, for hurricanes for residents and government.\n\nPeople on the Coast know the drill with a storm coming — stockpile water and food, flashlights and batteries; gas up the cars, board up the windows and prepare for roughing it without power or resupply for at least a few days. If it looks like it will be a mild storm or near miss, hunker down and hope a “hurricane party” is in the offing. If it looks worse, leave town, go to a shelter or find some place that was safe during Camille.\n\nState and local governments knew the drill, too.\n\nAs Katrina gained steam, agencies enacted hurricane plans. As reports of the storm grew dire, then-Gov. Haley Barbour said, the state began “worst-case, Camille-type calamity” preparations. Barbour declared a state of emergency and authorized deployment of the National Guard. State Adj. Gen. Harold Cross readied 3,200 National Guard members for deployment and set up base at Camp Shelby near Hattiesburg. MEMA Director Robert Latham activated the State Emergency Operations Center in Jackson and sent an emergency response team to Shelby. Mississippi Power Co. put crews on standby and notified other companies they might need help.\n\nBy Saturday, it became clear Katrina was a monster. Her winds extended 280 miles across. In satellite images, she covered much of the Gulf.\n\nBut some local governments, and residents, were slow with evacuations on Saturday. Coast residents were suffering what Latham termed “hurricane fatigue.” Just a month before, Hurricane Dennis threatened the area, and Ivan before that, and people were tired of going through the drill for dry runs.\n\nBarbour received a call from Max Mayfield, head of the National Hurricane Center, on Saturday night. He warned Barbour how bad Katrina looked — potentially another Camille — and asked what he could do to help.\n\n“I said what you can do is to say that, say this is going to be like Camille and get the news stations to start saying it,” Barbour said. “We know what that’s like. If you tell people it’s like Camille, they’ll get out.”\n\nWeather Channel celebrity storm chaser Jim Cantore told then-Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway he should take a last tour of his city, “because it’s not going to look this way after Katrina.” Holloway, in a plea for people to evacuate, told TV cameras “this is a killer storm.”\n\nThe Camille factor saved lives, compelling many who would have ridden out a lesser storm to leave. And it cost lives, providing a false sense of security to those who stayed in areas that had been safe and dry in 1969.\n\n“We thought Hurricane Camille was the mother of all storms,” said Biloxi restaurateur Bobby Mahoney, “until we found out storms don’t have mothers.”\n\nSlow, methodical destruction\n\n“We’d been through many storms, and lived in that house since 1990. A neighbor lived there during Camille, and said they didn’t get any water. So we stayed. Most everyone in our neighborhood stayed. We were fat, dumb and happy, two miles inland.” — Cheryl York, then living in Gulfport’s Bayou View neighborhood.\n\nCamille had hit the Coast with compact intensity — 190 mph sustained winds — and moved rapidly, creating a nearly 23-foot storm surge.\n\nKatrina was slow and methodical. Its sustained winds dropped to 130 mph before its Monday landfall, but it was double Camille’s breadth. Its gusts and rain stretched over 400 miles and it “sat on” the entire Mississippi Coast, slowly battering it with a surge of nearly 30 feet in some areas and wave action above that. A buoy in the Gulf measured a 55-foot wave, the largest NOAA ever measured.\n\nMore than a dozen Waveland police clung for dear life to a red-top bush as the storm surge obliterated their city. Others were stranded on the roof and in a pickup.\n\nCheryl and Jerry York, like many of their neighbors, were trapped in their attic for hours, at one point fearing they’d have to break through the roof or drown, after water reached their ceiling.\n\nMahoney, riding Katrina out with family at Mary Mahoney’s restaurant in Biloxi, was cut severely when a wave blew out a window and “knocked me back like 10 linebackers.”\n\nHighway Patrol Capt. Albert Santa Cruz, now public safety commissioner, and his son clung to two ice chests lashed together with an extension cord for more than four hours in 10 feet of water in D’Iberville. His yard didn’t even flood during Camille.\n\nScott Sundberg and his wife watched their Long Beach home disintegrate and rode out the flood atop their upside-down sailboat in their yard.\n\nKatrina killed 238 Mississippians and injured more than 17,000, with one death as far inland as Jackson. Its final death toll was 1,833 over five states.\n\nThe storm, which still remained a Category 1 hurricane inland 150 miles to Meridian, spawned more than 40 tornadoes. Katrina caused at least $108 billion in damage, the all-time record.\n\nKatrina destroyed 104,000 Mississippi homes or apartments and damaged another 160,000. It effectively wiped Waveland off the map, leaving no habitable structures, and did likewise with much of Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian and East Biloxi. It took out the bay bridges on each end of the Coast and wiped out most of U.S. 90 and parts of I-10. Its destruction was catastrophic from state line to state line in the six lowermost counties and it caused damage across more than half the state.\n\nRoads were impassable. Power was out for more than 2.5 million people.\n\nKatrina overwhelmed local, state and federal disaster preparations and operations. And, in the start of a storyline that would at times overshadow Mississippi’s destruction, the storm caused numerous breaches in the poorly maintained levee system that protected New Orleans. This flooded most of the city, exposed lack of disaster planning and response in our sister state and started a man-made disaster on top of the natural one.\n\nThe aftermath\n\n“We have been abandoned by our own country … Who needs to be fired? … Nobody’s coming to get us! Nobody’s coming to get us!” — Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, President Aaron Broussard, breaking into tears on “Meet the Press” on Sept. 4, 2005.\n\n“Everything hasn’t been perfect here, by any stretch of the imagination. But the federal government (has) tried hard. Our people have tried hard. Firemen and policemen and emergency medical people, National Guard, highway patrolmen have been working virtually around the clock … And we’ve made progress every day.” — Gov. Haley Barbour, calmly following Broussard’s interview on “Meet the Press.”\n\nThe Mississippi Coast after Katrina was a surreal landscape.\n\nHarrison County Emergency Management Director Joe Spraggins, in an Aug. 30 interview with The Clarion-Ledger, said downtown Gulfport “looks like Nagasaki.” In what would become a famous Biloxi Sun Herald headline, Mayor Holloway called it “Our Tsunami.”\n\nFirst responders worked ’round the clock to rescue thousands and began the somber task of collecting the dead.\n\nMississippi residents climbed through 46 million cubic yards of rubble that had been their homes, schools and businesses. Thousands pitched tents or packed into shelters and scavenged for food, water and medical care.\n\nThe federal government’s initial disaster response floundered, ill prepared and moribund with bureaucracy, with FEMA unable even to get emergency food and water into theater in a timely manner. Barbour recounts how Gen. Cross, desperate to get food and water days after the storm but stymied by red tape, finally told the Pentagon, “send me body bags, or food and water, the choice is yours” — prompting an unprecedented airlift of supplies to the Coast.\n\nBarbour said he realized quickly that someone had to be in charge of Mississippi’s recovery and “for better or worse, that was me.”\n\nIn contrast to federal and Louisiana officials, Barbour would be lauded for his leadership after Katrina. He also became the state’s head cheerleader, telling national media Mississippians know how to “hitch up their britches” and help themselves and their neighbors recover.\n\nBarbour said he quickly decided the rough, three-part outline of the initial recovery: “People need a place to live, a job and a place for their kids to go to school.”\n\nHe had lots of help on the leadership front — Coast and state elected officials, community and business leaders, powerful U.S. Sens. Thad Cochran and Trent Lott and the rest of the state’s congressional delegation. State and local leaders pulled together after the calamity.\n\nBarbour says recovery efforts benefited greatly from Mississippians being “strong, self-reliant people.”\n\nAnd what would eventually total nearly 1 million volunteers from around the country and world began pouring into Mississippi to help clean up and rebuild.\n\nThe new normal\n\n“In 30 years, when I’m dead and gone, people will look at what the Coast and south Mississippi have become. If it is simply a newer version of today, we will have failed those people, our children and grandchildren. If, on the other hand, it has become what it can be, bigger and better than ever, then those people in 30 years will say these folks after Katrina, they got it right and we are grateful to them.” — Gov. Haley Barbour, addressing a special session of the state Legislature four weeks after Katrina.\n\nThe hurdles to the state’s initial Katrina recovery were many.\n\nResidents who lost homes began long battles with insurance companies over “wind vs. water” damage. The federal Stafford Act that governs much of federal disaster relief spending proved woefully inadequate for a “mega-disaster” like Katrina. For starters, it didn’t anticipate whole towns being wiped out.\n\n“We had wrapped ourselves in 30 years of regulation and red tape,” said Coast business leader Jack Norris, who was on Lott’s congressional staff when Katrina hit and was named director of Barbour’s Katrina recovery office. “It’s hard to get or spend federal money. At the end of the day, we found out, a FEMA dollar is worth a lot less than a dollar.”\n\nThe passage of two measures — one state and one federal — were key to Mississippi’s recovery. One was $24.6 billion in federal aid that included an unprecedented more than $2 billion grant program to help homeowners rebuild. The other was a change in state law to allow casinos, formerly restricted to water, to rebuild onshore.\n\nWithout the homeowner program and other aid, thousands would have been unable to rebuild and left the Coast. Without the onshore casino provision, the industry would have pulled up stakes and devastated the Coast and state economy. Both were tough sells but were passed after intense political battles in Jackson and Washington.\n\nMost of the casinos quickly rebuilt — and a few new ones have come in since — helping alleviate unemployment that skyrocketed to more than 20 percent for some areas after Katrina.\n\nThe housing program, which included grants up to $150,000 for those who lost homes to flooding and didn’t have federal flood insurance, was deemed a success. The Coast lost population but avoided diaspora and has regained pre-Katrina numbers.\n\nFormer Biloxi Mayor Gerald Blessey, who served as the Katrina recovery “housing czar,” said the housing program, now mostly finished, was a savior for the Coast and on whole went well.\n\n“I would have to give our state and local officials’ performance high marks,” Blessey said. “The debris removal, getting the schools back up and running went phenomenally fast, the infrastructure work. Some officials did better than others. But I would give Haley high marks for sure, and I’m a lifelong Democrat.”\n\nBarbour created a Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal commission, and appointed philanthropist and business leader Jim Barksdale to lead it. Its goal: help the Coast rebuild bigger and better.\n\nJust six weeks after Katrina, hundreds of state and local leaders gathered with some of the world’s top urban planners, architects and “New Urbanism” leaders for a “Mississippi Renewal Forum,” the first of many brainstorming sessions to help plan rebuilding.\n\nThe New Urbanist leaders, excited to have a relatively clean slate, were pushing for communities to rebuild higher-density, pedestrian-friendly mixed-use communities, avoid the Southern sprawl of pre-Katrina and meet Barbour’s goal of not just rebuilding, but a “renaissance.”\n\nSome of these plans would bear fruit while others still appear pipe dreams.\n\n“A lot of those were more dreams and hopes than they were practical rebuilding plans,” Barksdale said. “But that was their intention. I think every community took those plans and tried to do as much as they could.”\n\n“A lot of us who came in from elsewhere were so hopeful just because of the resources that were coming in for the recovery that some monumental changes could take place,” said urban planner Ben Brown. “But because we came from someplace else we didn’t appreciate the depth of the shock people were feeling, nor did we really grasp the power of the need to get things back to the way they were above all else.”\n\nBillions of recovery dollars and projects created an initial boon. But then the national recession hit in 2008, followed by the BP Gulf oil disaster in 2010.\n\nThis led Coast bank president Chevis Swetman to ask at one point, “What’s next, locusts?”\n\nTen years later\n\n“I lost everything, literally, in the house and cars. I had a pair of short pants, flip flops and a polo shirt, that was it. We got word the president was coming to the Coast … So, I went to the meeting wearing what I had on … But after that, it just became kind of a symbol. We still needed tremendous support, and it seemed like dressing up would give the indication we were OK. We were a long way from OK … I told somebody I’d wear shorts until they give us what we need — maybe they’ll get tired of looking at these ugly legs.” — then-Mayor of Bay St. Louis Eddie Favre, who didn’t don a pair of long pants until early 2011.\n\nThe Coast has made remarkable progress in 10 years. But it still bears scars.\n\nBusiness is booming on Casino Row in Biloxi. Downtown Gulfport, Bay St. Louis and Ocean Springs are full of night life, tourist attractions and new restaurants and bars.\n\nBiloxi is well along with the Coast’s last large Katrina public works project, $350 million in water and sewerage repairs and upgrades. The city just saw the opening of the Coast’s first professional baseball stadium, home of the Biloxi Shuckers.\n\n“I marvel at how beautiful the Coast is, and at the building and construction that’s been done,” said Gov. Phil Bryant.\n\nBut vacant lots and slabs still dot most areas, and there are entire neighborhoods and communities — such as much of East Biloxi — that remain empty.\n\n“Gaaawn,” Favre said as he showed the slab where his home used to be near the bay. In a tour of the area he points out many other vacant lots, and the homes that have been rebuilt are high up on pilings to meet flood zone code, some as high as 30 feet in the air.\n\n“Only some people can afford to build here — when you have to go 15 or 20 or more feet up,” Favre said.\n\nBarksdale noted the pre-Katrina Mississippi Coast was one of the last places in the U.S. where people of modest means could live on or near the water before Katrina. But that may be irrevocably changed with new federal flood maps and building requirements and the lack of affordable private insurance.\n\nMany who rebuilt south of the CSX rail tracks along the Coast are paying huge premiums or cannot get private insurance and are forced to get expensive coverage from the state-sponsored “wind pool.” Most Coast leaders still cite insurance as the No. 1 impediment to growth and renewal.\n\nBiloxi Mayor FoFo Gilich said progress in many areas has been impressive, but he expects the battle to bring back residential growth amid problems with insurance and flood regulations will continue for years and “nobody wants to live in a treehouse.”\n\nThe Yorks rebuilt their Bayou View home. This was an odessy of living in a camper in their driveway, fighting with their insurance company and working hard, driven by a “can-do spirit,” Cheryl said. They moved into it in July 2006.\n\nBut the storm had taken a toll, Cheryl York said, and “I don’t know if it was post-traumatic stress or what, but it just didn’t go away.” Subsequent storm threats — boarding up, packing up and sheltering inland — caused stress over the years and finally prompted the couple to move to Wiggins in 2014.\n\nSundberg, a structural engineer, after the harrowing experience on his upside-down sailboat, completed work on a solid concrete, storm resistant home on the beach in Pass Christian that he’d started before Katrina. He’s been a vocal advocate for building “higher, dryer and safer,” and has been a consultant to FEMA and private industry.\n\nMuch of the rebuilding, Sundberg said, is higher, dryer and safer, particularly commercial and public buildings. Others — including many that are now on tall pilings — make him cringe when he looks at them with an engineer’s eye. He said people on the Coast, as a practical matter, are going to have to “maybe build smaller, build without some luxuries and do things differently in high-hazard zones.”\n\n“We saw damage with (Hurricanes) Gustav and Ike that we should not have seen,” Sundberg said. “... The buck has to stop somewhere.”\n\nState and local leaders had numerous celebrations and remembrances for Katrina’s 10th anniversary.\n\n“It’s been a remarkable story that I hope the world will remember,” Bryant said. “If you look at where we were 10 years ago — some people would have believed we could never do it, never rebuild. I remember Gov. Barbour time after time in meetings saying if we don’t build back bigger and better we will have failed.\n\n“We have not failed. We have done a remarkable job.”\n\nContact Geoff Pender at (601) 961-7266 or gpender@ jackson.gannett.com.

The previous record was 22.8 feet, also in Pass Christian, during Camille. Some have argued the Katrina surge topped 30 feet in some areas. Factoring wave action, water broke well above 30 feet in many areas in Mississippi. In the Gulf, Katrina produced the highest wave ever recorded by a NOAA bouy, 55 feet.\n\nDeaths (direct and indirect)\n\n•Louisiana: 1,577\n\n•Mississippi: 238 (170 of those on the Coast)\n\n•Florida: 14\n\n•Alabama: 2\n\n•Georgia: 2\n\nTotal deaths: 1,833\n\nDamage\n\n•$108 billion, costliest disaster in U.S. history\n\n•104,000 housing units destroyed in Mississippi, including more than 51,000 houses\n\n•$34.4 billion in insurance claims, costliest disaster in history of insurance industry (more than $9 billion in claims on Mississippi Gulf Coast)\n\nFederal spending\n\nMississippi received $24.6 billion in federal Katrina funds. This included:\n\n•Home owner assistance: $2.09 billion (total housing money, $4 billion)\n\n•Federal highway funds: $1.03 billion\n\n•FEMA public assistance: $3 billion\n\n•National Flood Insurance Program: $2.6 billion\n\n•Home owner and renter loans: $2 billion\n\n•Federal activities (military, coastal restoration, Corps of Engineers, etc): $4.4 billion\n\nKatrina lexicon\n\nHurricane Katrina altered the very fabric of the Mississippi Coast, including language. Some terms now familiar to those who weathered the storm and its aftermath:\n\nSlabbed: Katrina’s surge wiped many homes away, down to the slab. This became a verb, as in, “We were slabbed.”\n\nOur Tsunami: From a quote by Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway, made famous in an Aug. 30, 2005, headline in the Biloxi Sun Herald.\n\nWind vs. water: The main battle between insurance companies, who didn’t cover flooding, and homeowners.\n\nVoluntourism: Nearly a million volunteers poured into Mississippi to help after Katrina. Many liked the people and area so much they returned, bringing family, making it a working vacation.\n\nNew normal: A catch-all term for life on the Coast after Katrina.\n\nDisastrous opportunity: Term used by leaders to note the clean slate from destruction offered a chance to rebuild bigger and better.\n\nFEMA trailer: Small, government-issued travel trailers first used on a large scale for temporary emergency housing in Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\nKatrina cottage: More permanent, small modular housing created by the Mississippi Renewal Forum group as a better alternative to FEMA trailers. Some have become permanent homes or businesses on the Coast.\n\nHitch up your britches: A catch-phrase for then-Gov. Haley Barbour praising the resilience of Mississippians who “got knocked flat, but hitched up their britches and went to work.” Barbour said he got the term from his high school football coach.\n\nNew Urbanism: Urban planning movement that promotes mixed-use development with walkable communities. New Urbanism planners, architects and other experts attended Mississippi “charettes,” after Katrina to help develop rebuilding plans.\n\nThe Forgotten Coast: Term referring to Mississippi — where Hurricane Katrina hit — being overshadowed in the national consciousness by the levee failures, flooding and chaos in New Orleans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/28/helene-north-carolina-historic-flooding-damage/75434466007/", "title": "Epic flooding in North Carolina's 'own Hurricane Katrina'", "text": "(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy. A video was also added. )\n\nHelene’s swath of destruction has caused historic rainfall, flooding, power outages and 140-mile-an-hour winds across the Southeast. But it was North Carolina that bore the brunt of it Saturday with vast swaths of cities like Asheville underwater, residents trapped in their homes with no lights or food and few functioning roads for rescue workers to help them.\n\nHelene, Gov. Roy Cooper declared, had become “one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.”\n\nZeb Smathers, the mayor of Canton, N.C., took to Facebook during a quick break from responding to what he described as \"an unimaginable and horrific disaster.\"\n\n“I have limited time to post, but this is the first message I’ve been able to share following the apocalyptic flooding that hit us” and breakdowns in cellular communications that followed, Smathers wrote. “My heart is broken, not only for our town but for the entire region.”\n\nMore than 400 roads remained closed in the Tar Heel State, including “all roads in Western NC,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation said in a post on X. “Remember: As crews work to clear and inspect roads and bridges, please give them room.”\n\nCrews needed more than just room to operate. Well over 2 feet of rain had fallen across the state’s mountainous region in recent days thanks to a rare confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. before Helene arrived in Florida on Thursday night.\n\nTiny Busick in Yancey County along the western border with Tennessee, recorded 29.58 inches in just 48 hours. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate. The historic Biltmore Village nearby was nearly submerged after Helene tore through the area, according to aerial footage,.\n\nAt least 5,000 emergency calls to 911 were fielded since Sept. 26. And with more than 200 North Carolinians requiring rescue from following Helene’s torrential rains, local, state and federal officials mobilized to help.\n\nNorth Carolina, like Georgia and Alabama, activated hundreds of its own National Guard, and the governors of Maryland, and at least 17 other states sent Guard units of their own. Three federal teams were also deployed, and supplies were being airlifted in Saturday as and search and rescue operations continued throughout the state, Cooper said.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, becoming the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. The storm continued its push across western Kentucky on Saturday, and was expected to slowly move southeast, then east along the Kentucky-Tennessee border through the weekend, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBiden briefed on 'tragic loss of life,' devastation\n\nOn Saturday, President Joe Biden approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee. On Saturday evening, Biden was briefed on the impacts of Helene on multiple Southeastern states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee, by Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\n\"Criswell described the tragic loss of life across the region and the devastation in the Big Bend communities of Florida that she visited today,\" a statement from the White House said. Criswell will travel to Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday, it said, as part of the administration's effort to speed support to survivors and deploy more search and rescue teams to \"accelerate recovery efforts\" in North Carolina.\n\n\"The President will be briefed on an ongoing basis through the weekend,\" the White House said.\n\nDowned trees, power lines across region\n\nHigh winds gusting up to hurricane strength brought down trees, power lines and cell towers across the region. Dozens of deaths have been attributed to Helene’s onslaught, according to authorities and media reports across the Southeast. A tally of the deaths approached 50 on Saturday morning, and officials said they expected the death toll to keep rising as they continued to go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nAccording to the USA TODAY power outage map, there were 635,887 total outages reported in North Carolina on Saturday afternoon. In response, crews from across the United States were on scene to help with immediate restoration and repair efforts, North Carolina’s Department of Public Safety said. On Friday night, 16 shelters in the state housed about 1,100 residents.With cellphone service spotty in western areas of the state, telecom companies activated \"disaster roaming,\" “allowing any phone on any cellular network to access any available network to connect to,” according to the state's public safety department.\n\nStatewide, at least 29 North Carolina counties and 52 towns and cities issued state of emergency announcements, in addition to the statewide emergency declaration Cooper issued on Wednesday in advance of the storm.\n\n“This is a historic and catastrophic storm for Western North Carolina and I’m grateful to first responders working right now to save lives and evacuate residents,” Cooper said.\n\nWhy is Helene so destructive?\n\nForecasters began warning last Tuesday that a confluence of weather patterns was coming together that would likely soak the region. A front overhead was going to interact with a plume of moisture being pulled in ahead of Helene.\n\nThe rain \"started well ahead of the storm, training up from the Gulf into our area, and circulation around the storm pushed moisture up from the extremely warm Gulf waters,\" said David Easterling, a rain expert with NOAA's National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit.\n\nInteractions like this, with a band of moisture ahead of a tropical storm or hurricane, are called predecessor events and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. Jet stream winds blowing aloft at more than 115 mph provided lift that further enhanced moisture in the developing storms.\n\nBy Wednesday, the National Weather Service warned that rain in parts of the region could fall at rates up to 3 inches an hour.\n\nSatellite images showed how the cyclone and the upper level low to the northwest more or less merged on Wednesday, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another six inches fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\nHelene’s massive circulation moved into the mix with more rain, and then transitioned into a post tropical cyclone.\n\nRain flowing into rivers in the mountainous areas quickly turned into cataclysmic flooding, setting an all-time record high on the Pigeon River at Newport, Tennessee. At least three of the flood level records broken Friday were set more than a century ago, when the lingering remnants of one tropical system in July 1916 were followed by another, producing heavy rain.\n\nFloodwater, which weighs 1,700 pounds per cubic yard, washed away roads and cars and stranded residents in mountain communities. At Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee, floodwaters stranded 54 people on the roof.\n\nBy Friday evening, record-breaking rainfall totals were reported in some Southeast locations, with more than a foot of rain across swaths of Georgia and South Carolina. Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia saw widespread amounts ranging from 4 to 7 inches.\n\nEyepopping rainfall totals were measured elsewhere in the North Carolina mountains besides Busick. Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River and a landmark along the Blue Ridge Parkway, got hit with more than 2 feet.\n\nThat rain in the high North Carolina mountains then created the raging torrents across the Southeast that forced people from their homes in the dead of night Friday along the Nolichucky River in eastern Tennessee.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2022/10/01/hurricane-ian-recovery-saturday-updates-naples-marco-island-isle-capri-collier-county-florida/8140475001/", "title": "Hurricane Ian recovery: Saturday updates for Naples, Collier County", "text": "This is a live news blog with information about the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida Our reporters and photographers are spread out across Southwest Florida covering our communities and providing the latest information.\n\nDISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\nHERE IS THE LATEST ON SUPPLIES IN SWFL\n\n9:42 p.m. | State medical examiners: 44 deaths in state; 30 in Lee, 3 in Collier\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement released Ian death counts Saturday night, reporting 44 statewide, including 30 in Lee and 3 in Collier.\n\nThe FDLE news release said: Florida District Medical Examiners report hurricane deaths to the Medical Examiners Commission (MEC) following autopsy after confirming the death is storm-related.

It is currently disabled.\n\nThe data comes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tide gages. There are not stations on Sanibel and Fort Myers Beach.\n\nHowever, if the water level rose more than 10 feet on Fort Myers Beach, as many residents suspect, Ian could be considered a 100-year-flood event based on water levels, according to pending FEMA flood maps. That means the chances of a storm like Ian hitting is once every 100 years. If the water levels rose more than 12 feet there, it would be considered a 500-year-flood event based on water levels, according to the flood maps.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis has called Ian “basically a 500-year flood event.”\n\nREAD FULL STORY ABOUT SURGE, WIND, RAIN\n\n12:46 p.m. | Some Collier boil water notices lifted, others still in place\n\nCollier County Public Utilities has lifted the boil water notice for customers in Isles of Capri, Goodland and all areas west of U.S. 41 from north of Seagate Drive to South of Bonita Beach Road with some exceptions.\n\nGulf Shore Drive and The Strand at Bay Colony are still under a boil notice and will be until further notice.\n\nCollier County received upwards of 6 inches of rain, according to early National Weather Service reports, and about 5 feet of storm surge.\n\nCombined, the forces caused officials to release a boil water notice to keep the public safe.\n\nMore information about water usage in Collier can be found here: colliercountyfl.gov/boilwatermap.\n\nCustomer service can be reached at (239) 252-2380.\n\n12:36 p.m.| RSW has no current timeline to reopen\n\nAccording to Southwest International Airport spokesperson Vicky Moreland there is no timeline for re-opening the airport.\n\nMoreland confirmed that a Delta flight from Atlanta landed at RSW earlier on Saturday with supplies.\n\n12:04 p.m. | Phone service update\n\nLumen technicians continue to survey and repair network damage in Florida communities, following safety guidelines.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 1 Update:\n\nWe are prioritizing our restoration efforts for healthcare and safety services.\n\nCommercial power remains out in a large part of the state so many Lumen network locations remain on generators and battery power.\n\nFlooding issues are growing in some locations and continue to impact technicians being dispatched for repairs and to refuel generators.\n\nApproximately 323,000 home internet and 47,000 home phone services are impacted, up slightly from yesterday.\n\nWe will continue to make repairs as quickly as possible while keeping employee safety a top priority.\n\n11:16 a.m. | Boiler water notice issued for City of Naples\n\nThe City of Naples remains under a Precautionary Boil Water Notice for its entire drinking water service area, which includes all of the City of Naples and a portion of Collier County.\n\nThe City’s drinking water service area extends south from Pine Ridge Road / Seagate Drive, and west of Livingston Road.

History ...", "text": "The New York Jets became the first team in the 2024 NFL season to make a coaching change by firing Robert Saleh after their Week 5 loss to Minnesota. Saleh and the team parted ways after a 2-3 start to his fourth season in New York.\n\nIn a statement, Jets owner Woody Johnson said the team is moving forward with defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich as the head coach for the rest of the season.\n\n\"He is a tough coach who has the respect of the coaches and players on this team,\" Johnson's statement read. \"I believe he, along with the coaches on this staff, can get the most out of our talented team and attain the goals we established this offseason.\"\n\nUlbrich takes over with a \"Monday Night Football\" matchup with AFC East rival Buffalo next on the Jets' schedule.\n\nNew York started the season with playoff aspirations. Can Ulbrich lead them there? Here's what history says about interim head coaches making the playoffs.\n\nNFL playoff teams with an interim coach\n\nOnly two teams in NFL history have made the playoffs with an interim head coach: the 2021 Las Vegas Raiders and the 1961 Houston Oilers (now Tennessee Titans).\n\nRaiders coach Jon Gruden resigned after five games in 2021 after emails excerpts including homophobic, racist, and misogynistic language he used were released by the NFL as part of an investigation into former Washington Commanders team owner Daniel Snyder.\n\nSpecial teams coordinator Rich Bisaccia took over the 3-2 Raiders team and led them to a 10-7 finish and a playoff berth. The Raiders lost 26-19 to the Bengals in the AFC wild card playoffs.\n\nIn 1961, Oilers owner Bud Adams fired coach Lou Rymkus after a 1-3-1 start to the season. Assistant coach Wally Lemm took over and led the Oilers to nine consecutive victories, including the AFL championship title.\n\nThese are the only success stories in NFL history. Another interim head coach nearly qualified for this: Bruce Arians with the 2012 Indianapolis Colts. Arians took over for 12 weeks of the regular season while head coach Chuck Pagano underwent treatment for leukemia. However, Pagano returned before the playoffs and was on the sidelines for the Colts' wild card game.\n\nOverall, history isn't on Ulbrich and the Jets' side to make the playoffs in 2024, but they do enter Week 6 as one of five AFC teams with two wins. Their remaining schedule is the fourth-easiest in the league, per Sharp Football Analysis, opening the door for a potential playoff run.\n\nJeff Ulbrich playing career\n\nUlbrich was selected in the third round (86th overall) in the 2000 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He played 10 seasons with the 49ers as a linebacker and started 75 of his 120 career games. He tallied 501 tackles, 5.5 sacks, two interceptions, and two fumble recoveries in those 120 games.\n\nHe finished the 2009 NFL season on injured reserve and announced his retirement in December of that year.\n\nJeff Ulbrich coaching experience\n\nUlbrich stayed in the NFC West to start his coaching career. He began in Seattle as an assistant special teams coordinator for the 2010 and 2011 NFL seasons. He spent the next three years with the UCLA Bruins as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator.\n\nUlbrich returned to the NFL for the 2015 season with the Atlanta Falcons. He was the linebackers coach for four seasons before moving to an assistant head coach role in 2020. When the Falcons fired coach Dan Quinn that season and promoted Raheem Morris in an interim role, Ulbrich took over as defensive coordinator.\n\nWhen Saleh was hired as the Jets' head coach in 2021, he brought Ulbrich along as defensive coordinator. Ulbrich has been in that role ever since.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/01/06/saints-coaching-candidates-aaron-glenn-mike-mccarthy/77472193007/", "title": "Saints coaching candidates: Who replaces Dennis Allen in New ...", "text": "The New Orleans Saints won their first two games of the 2024 NFL season and put forth incredible offensive numbers during those contests.

The Saints lost a whopping seven consecutive games, including a 23-22 contest to the Carolina Panthers in Week 9, and as a result, New Orleans fired its head coach Dennis Allen.\n\nAllen entered the 2024 NFL season on the hot seat, so seeing him go wasn't surprising. He finished his time in New Orleans with an 18-25 record and failed to lead the Saints to the playoffs during his two-plus years after replacing Sean Payton.\n\nThe Saints are now staring down the barrel of a rebuild, which they have avoided since the end of the Payton era. New Orleans may endure some lean years as it fixes some of the salary cap issues created by the team's recent roster management, so the Saints' front office will likely evaluate its coaching options from a long-term lens.\n\nWho will be among the Saints' top coaching candidates? Here's a look at the team's options for replacing Allen.\n\nSAINTS FIRE DENNIS ALLEN: Why New Orleans moved on from head coach\n\nSaints coaching candidates\n\nMike Vrabel, former Tennessee Titans head coach\n\nVrabel is one of the hottest coaching candidates on the market, so it shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that he is \"high on the list\" for the Saints, per Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer.\n\nVrabel posted a 54-45 record during his six seasons in charge of the Titans and spent the 2024 season as a consultant with the Cleveland Browns. The 49-year-old built a reputation for getting his rosters to outperform expectations, especially on defense, and helped guide a Ryan Tannehill-led offense to the AFC's No. 1 seed in 2021.\n\nVrabel's history should appeal to the Saints, who are finally set to undergo a rebuild given their salary cap issues. He could focus on developing young players like Alontae Taylor, Bryan Bresee and Kool-Aid McKinstry into defensive leaders while giving New Orleans the culture reset it needs as it moves further away from Payton's heyday.\n\nMIKE VRABEL LANDING SPOTS: Patriots, Jets, best fits for former Titans coach\n\nMike McCarthy, Dallas Cowboys head coach\n\nBreer reports that \"familiarity will be a factor for the Saints\" in their coaching search. If McCarthy and the Cowboys part ways, that puts him in the running for the job.\n\nMcCarthy served as the Saints' offensive coordinator under Jim Haslett from 2000-04. The Saints routinely sported above-average offenses during that time, which helped McCarthy to develop into a top head coaching candidate.\n\nMcCarthy has enjoyed two decades of success as an NFL head coach. He won Super Bowl 45 with the Green Bay Packers and posted a 174-111-2 career record entering Week 18 of the 2024 NFL season. He is coming off a down season in Dallas but led the team to three consecutive 12-5 seasons and playoff appearances in the previous three campaigns.\n\nWith that in mind, the Saints should be interested in McCarthy if he becomes available. The 61-year-old's contract with the Cowboys expires on January 14, and it isn't yet clear whether the two parties will agree to an extension.\n\nAaron Glenn, Detroit Lions defensive coordinator\n\nSpeaking of familiarity, that's something Glenn has with the Saints' organization. He spent the final season of his career with New Orleans in 2008 and five seasons on Payton's staff as a defensive backs coach from 2016-20.\n\nSince then, Glenn has worked in conjunction with Dan Campbell to turn the Lions from a bottom-barrel team into a legitimate Super Bowl contender. The team's defensive numbers during that stretch may not be overly impressive, but Glenn, like Campbell, got his players to play hard routinely despite a dearth of talent on that side of the ball.\n\nWith more depth and talent at his disposal in 2024, the 52-year-old has Detroit on track to finish with a top-10 scoring defense. That is despite dealing with countless injuries to key players like Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill and Carlton Davis, among others, so the Saints should see an upside with Glenn.\n\nJoe Brady, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator\n\nHere's one more high-end coaching candidate with Saints connections. Brady was an offensive assistant in New Orleans from 2017-18 before his star took off as Joe Burrow's offensive coordinator at LSU. That could make the 35-year-old a high-upside hire for the Saints.\n\nBrady may be young, but he was one of the architects of LSU's historic offense and helped lead the Tigers to a national championship. Since then, he has helped Josh Allen cut down on his turnovers and become a legitimate MVP candidate while improving the Bills' Super Bowl outlook.\n\nTOP COACHING CANDIDATES: Ben Johnson, Kliff Kingsbury top options for 2025\n\nMatt Nagy, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator\n\nNagy's candidacy may leave some New Orleans fans scratching their heads, but The Athletic's Dianna Russini reports \"expects the Saints to show interest\" in the Chiefs' offensive coordinator.\n\nNagy posted a 34-31 record during his four-year stint as the Chicago Bears' head coach and was named the AP Coach of the Year in 2018 after leading the Bears to a 12-4 record. Things deteriorated after that, as Nagy's offenses ranked in the bottom quartile of the league for his final three years in Chicago. Still, the 46-year-old has rebuilt his stock by rejoining Andy Reid's staff in Kansas City.\n\nThe Chiefs have boasted above-average marks in yardage and scoring in two seasons since Nagy returned as the team's offensive coordinator in 2023. They have ranked top-11 in EPA per play during that time, so that could be enough to get Nagy a second look as an NFL head coach.\n\nDavid Shaw, Denver Broncos senior personnel executive\n\nShaw's currently in a front-office role with the Broncos, but the 52-year-old has an extensive coaching history at both the NFL and college levels.\n\nMost notably, Shaw spent 12 years as Stanford's head coach following the departure of Jim Harbaugh from the NFL. Shaw led the Cardinal to a 96-54 record during his time with the school and became the school's winningest-ever coach, ahead of Pop Warner.\n\nShaw would be an outside-the-box candidate given that he hasn't coached in the NFL since 2005. Still, his time with the Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Ravens gives him a strong resume to draw consideration for the job. Add in that he has worked with Payton for the last two seasons in Denver, and it's easy to see why New Orleans would be interested in him.\n\nNFL Network's Jane Slater reports that the Saints plan to interview Shaw for their head coaching vacancy.\n\nJon Gruden, former Las Vegas Raiders head coach\n\nGruden has not coached since stepping down from his post with the Raiders in 2021 after emails containing racist, homophobic and misogynistic language from his time at ESPN were leaked to media outlets. Despite this, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero listed Gruden as a potential surprise candidate to be interviewed during the 2025 NFL hiring cycle.\n\nIf Gruden does attract interest from NFL teams, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Saints among them. He worked with the team in an advisory capacity during the 2023 offseason, and New Orleans was reportedly interested in hiring him as its offensive coordinator before bringing aboard Klint Kubiak.\n\nGruden has a 117-112 career record as an NFL coach and led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a win over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 37.\n\nDarren Rizzi, New Orleans Saints interim coach\n\nRizzi led the Saints to a 3-1 record over his first four games as the team's interim coach before injuries decimated New Orleans' offense. The Saints didn't finish the season well as a result, but the team still seems likely to consider Rizzi given the energy with which the team played during his tenure.\n\nRizzi, 54, has been with the Saints since 2019. He has served as the club's special teams coordinator and became an assistant head coach in 2022, so he would give the franchise some of the continuity that it seems to highly value.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/01/06/nfl-coach-firing-black-monday-rumors-live-updates-news-analysis/77480241007/", "title": "NFL coach firing updates: Latest rumors, news on Black Monday", "text": "NFL teams once again didn't wait until \"Black Monday\" to take drastic action with their coaching staffs this season.\n\nWith Week 18 wrapping up Sunday and the playoff picture complete, four teams already find themselves with vacancies in their top jobs: the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots. History suggests more firings are still to come, with dismissals of key assistant coaches also likely in several spots. And it shouldn't take long for teams to begin moving on their searches, with interview requests sure to start filtering in.\n\nHere are all the latest updates on coach firings and moves throughout the league on Monday:\n\nBears request Cowboys' permission to interview Mike McCarthy for coaching vacancy\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have yet to formalize their plans for 2025, but the Chicago Bears are lurking in the background as a potential option for Mike McCarthy depending on how things pan out.\n\nThe Bears on Monday requested permission from the Cowboys to interview McCarthy for their head coaching vacancy, according to multiple reports.\n\nMcCarthy is still under contract through Jan. 14, so the Cowboys would have to grant permission for him to speak with another team.\n\nOn Sunday, McCarthy said his preference was to remain in Dallas.\n\n“Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,” McCarthy said. “And then there’s a personal side to all these decisions. They all point the right direction. I think anytime you invest your time, energy, your belief, the connection you have, the relationships that are in place here, the understanding of what the organization can do and is willing to do. Those are all positive attributes that you take into account.\"\n\nThe Bears also requested to speak with Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, according to multiple reports.\n\nShad Khan addresses decision to keep Jaguars GM Trent Baalke\n\nDoug Pederson's dismissal by the Jaguars came as little surprise on Monday. But owner Shad Khan's decision to keep general manager Trent Baalke stirred some intrigue.\n\nIn a news conference Monday, Khan pushed back against the notion that the Jaguars needed a \"complete overhaul,\" saying full-scale changes would be \"like shooting yourself in the foot.\" He also maintained that Baalke's presence wouldn't be an impediment to attracting a top coaching candidate.\n\n“We have a very compelling case of what we can offer the head coach,\" Khan said.\n\nKhan added that he's hoping the next coach will shake things up, calling Jacksonville \"the most predictable team\" on both offense and defense.\n\nAntonio Pierce is confident he's staying with Raiders\n\nAmid the various action through Monday, the Las Vegas Raiders had yet to indicate one way or another how they plan to proceed for 2025.\n\nBut when Antonio Pierce met the media on Monday, he stated his confidence he would be back for another season.\n\n\"I haven't been told anything different,\" Pierce said in a news conference when asked if he expects to return.\n\nPierce added speculation about his standing was \"coming from outside the building.\" He added he doesn't envision making any changes to his staff, which would indicate that interim offensive coordinator Scott Turner will remain in the role after taking over for the fired Luke Getsy.\n\nSeahawks fire offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb\n\nAfter one season, the Seattle Seahawks have moved on from offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb.\n\nHead coach Mike Macdonald, in charge of the defense, hired Grubb from nearby University of Washington to lead the offense after he helped lead the Huskies to the national title game last year. But the Seattle attack was inconsistent throughout the season, although quarterback Geno Smith continued his year-over-year statistical improvement. The Seahawks finished 28th in rushing yards as woes along the offensive line persisted.\n\nSmith stumped for Grubb following the team's win Sunday over the Los Angeles Rams, which put them at 10-7 on the season.\n\n\"Our first year, obviously there were some ups and downs ... I believe in this system,\" Smith said. \"I think Grubb has exactly what it takes to be a good coordinator in this league. It's his first year, man. Got to give the guy some grace.\"\n\nThe Seahawks, evidently, did not agree.\n\nSaints' interview list starts to come together\n\nThe New Orleans Saints haven't raced to begin the process of filling the void left by Dennis Allen's firing, but the team is starting to put together its plans for its head coaching search.\n\nThe Saints requested to interview Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady and Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, according to multiple reports. Glenn is a former protégé of Sean Payton who was an assistant coach in New Orleans from 2016-20 and has been widely linked to a possible return to the Saints.\n\nAll the players and the plays: Sign up for USA TODAY's Sports newsletter.\n\nAnother name emerges in Bears' coaching search\n\nThe Chicago Bears are moving forward with their coaching search by requesting an interview with Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing, according to multiple reports.\n\nPetzing, 37, helped the Cardinals finish 11th in total offense this season, with the seventh-ranked ground game pacing the attack. He is in his second year as the Cardinals' offensive coordinator.\n\nThe Bears have already requested interviews with Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, according to multiple reports.\n\nPatriots make interview request after firing Mayo\n\nThe New England Patriots are moving quickly after firing Jerod Mayo on Sunday, as the team has requested an interview with Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, according to multiple reports.\n\nJohnson, who orchestrated the NFL's top-scoring offense and is expected to one of the most in-demand candidates this cycle, can conduct virtual interviews with teams starting Wednesday given the Lions have a first-round bye. Johnson withdrew from the last two coaching cycles and is expected to once again be discerning about the openings he pursues.\n\nThe Patriots have been widely linked to former Tennessee Titans coach and New England standout Mike Vrabel, but Johnson could also be a strong candidate given the need to support Drake Maye after the quarterback's promising rookie season.\n\nNY Jets make requests for open GM, HC roles\n\nJets owner Woody Johnson has to find both a new GM and head coach this offseason and wasted little time in making requests Monday for employees of postseason-bound teams.\n\nThe Jets have asked to speak with Kansas City Chiefs assistant GM Mike Borgonzi, according to ESPN. They also requested Los Angeles Rams senior personnel executive Ray Farmer. Farmer was the general manager of the Cleveland Browns from 2014-15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant general manager Mike Greenberg and Minnesota Vikings senior vice president of player personnel Ryan Grigson also received requests, per multiple reports. The team has already met with former Atlanta Falcons GM Thomas Dimitroff, ex-Tennessee Titans GM Jon Robinson, Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy and ESPN analyst Louis Riddick about the role.\n\nHouston Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik received his first request for a head-coach opening from the Jets, per multiple reports, as did Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, San Francisco 49ers quarterbacks coach Brian Griese, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Vikings quarterbacks coach Josh McCown. The team has met with former NFL head coaches Mike Vrabel and Ron Rivera regarding the opening.\n\nGiants owner won't put 'time limit' on Schoen, Daboll\n\nWith the Giants in desperate need of a quarterback, owner John Mara was asked about the timeline regarding the future of GM Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll if the team selects a rookie signal-caller in the draft and whether his commitment to them extended beyond next season.\n\n\"I understand the question, but I'm not going to put any kind of time limit on it,\" Mara replied.\n\nHowever, it does not appear the leash is long.\n\n\"It better not take too long, because I've just about run out of patience,\" Mara said.\n\nWhether Schoen and Daboll will enter the 2025 season on the hot seat, Mara replied: \"We're gonna have to see. I'm gonna have to be in a better mood this time next year than I am right now.\"\n\nMara said he spoke to Daboll on Friday and encouraged the head coach to surrender play-calling duties on offense and hinted at moving on from defensive coordinator Shane Bowen after one season.\n\n\"We stunk this year,\" Mara said. \"The results on the field were not what we wanted them to be. There were a number of factors that went into that.\"\n\nThe Giants are picking third in a class that draft analysts say has two first-round talents in Cam Ward and Sheduer Sanders. The two teams ahead of them, the Tennessee Titans and Cleveland Browns, are also seeking quarterbacks of the future, which once again puts the franchise in the awkward position of picking early in the first round but too late at the same time.\n\nFinding a quarterback is \"the number one issue\" entering the offseason, Mara said.\n\nCincinnati Bengals fire defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo\n\nA strong finish to the season could not save Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, as Cincinnati let him go Monday after a 9-8 season that ended with the team missing the playoffs for the second straight season, according to multiple reports.\n\nAnarumo's defense, which improved throughout the season, surrendered 34 points or more in six games – all during the team's 4-8 start. The late-season revival, even with a depleted secondary, wasn't enough to convince head coach Zac Taylor and Bengals management to keep Anarumo around.\n\nAnarumo was a finalist for the Arizona Cardinals head-coaching job during the 2023 offseason.\n\nWhich NFL teams could make coaching changes on Black Monday?\n\nWith the Jaguars (firing Doug Pederson) and Giants (keeping Brian Daboll), resolution came quickly for those teams Monday.\n\nBut a pair of other organizations are still expected to make their intentions clear: the Dallas Cowboys and the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nCowboys head coach Mike McCarthy worked this season on an expiring contract, though his deal runs through Jan. 14. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones has praised McCarthy in recent weeks and the coach said after Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders – which dropped Dallas to 7-10 on the season – said he is interested in remaining with Dallas.\n\nFor the Raiders, head coach Antonio Pierce earned the job based on the reviews he received from players after he took over as the interim head coach in 2023. But the Raiders finished 4-13 and will pick sixth in the NFL draft.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans are expected to retain first-year coach Brian Callahan, and the Miami Dolphins and Indianapolis Colts clarified Sunday that Mike McDaniel and Shane Steichen, respectively, would return for 2025. That leaves five openings as of Monday morning – the three teams that fired their coaches during the season are looking for new ones, as are the New England Patriots (who let Jerod Mayo go after one year) and the Jaguars.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars fire Doug Pederson after three seasons\n\nBlack Monday began in earnest with perhaps the most obvious move of the offseason: the Jacksonville Jaguars moving on from head coach Doug Pederson.\n\nBefore the season, owner Shad Khan claimed this was the most talented team in Jacksonville since he purchased the organization. But the Jaguars finished 4-13 and third in a dismal AFC South, and Pederson's time was up despite a pair of 9-8 campaigns in his first two seasons (leaving him with an overall record of 22-29).\n\nPederson led the team to a division title in 2022, his first season, and a dramatic comeback victory in the wild-card round over the Los Angeles Chargers before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Jags started the next year 8-3 but missed the postseason and Pederson, who led the Philadelphia Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl, never regained his winning ways.\n\nIn a statement, Khan thanked Pederson and indicated general manager Trent Baalke will remain in that role.\n\nGiants' Brian Daboll, Joe Schoen safe after disaster season\n\nOnly one New York team will be on the hunt for a new coach and GM this offseason.\n\nGiants owner John Mara, in a statement Monday morning, said head coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen will return for the 2025 season.\n\n“As disappointing as the results of the season have been, (co-owner) Steve (Tisch) and I remain confident in the process that Joe and Brian have implemented and their vision for our team,\" Mara said in a statement. \"We look forward to the future and achieving the results we all desire.”\n\nThe Giants went 3-14 in 2024, their 100th season that was supposed to be a celebratory campaign. Instead, the brain trust hired three offseasons ago faced questions down the stretch of whether the would lose their jobs.\n\nThe \"Hard Knocks\" capturing the internal conversations between Schoen and Mara regarding former running back Saquon Barkley, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles and had a historic season, served as fodder that the GM's job was in jeopardy. The product on the Giants' end kept declining. Quarterback Daniel Jones was benched and released midseason, and the team snapped a 10-game losing streak – the longest in franchise history – in Week 17.\n\nAccording to NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network, the Giants had a team meeting at 8 a.m. ET followed by team brass debriefs.\n\nDaboll was Coach of the Year following the 2022 season, which included a surprise playoff appearance and postseason victory. But the Giants went 6-11 last season and after one of the worst years in franchise history, Daboll made his case that better quarterback play – which he'd mostly been deprived of since 2022 – actually gives teams a chance of winning. Now it appears he and Schoen will have the chance to choose a franchise quarterback of the future.\n\nWhat's going on with Mike McCarthy and Cowboys? Coach, Jerry Jones address uncertain future\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' season ended the way it began: without Jerry Jones making a firm commitment to Mike McCarthy.\n\nFollowing Sunday's 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders that wrapped up a 7-10 campaign for Dallas, the owner continued his long-running approach of speaking highly of his head coach while stopping short of saying anything definitive regarding McCarthy's job status for next season.\n\n\"Mike's one of the best coaches that I think there is,\" Jones said. \"He was made the coach here because I thought that, and he's done absolutely nothing to diminish my opinion of him as a coach.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who is under contract through Jan, 14, made it clear he wanted to remain with the organization despite speculation he could pursue another opening.\n\n“Absolutely. I have a lot invested here, and the Cowboys have a lot invested in me,” McCarthy said. “And then there’s a personal side to all these decisions. They all point the right direction. I think anytime you invest your time, energy, your belief, the connection you have, the relationships that are in place here, the understanding of what the organization can do and is willing to do. Those are all positive attributes that you take into account.\"\n\nLions' win could have ramifications for Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn in coaching searches\n\nThe Detroit Lions' win over the Minnesota Vikings shaped the NFC playoff picture, but it also could have fallout for several teams' coaching searches.\n\nWith the Lions having a bye, offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn can now conduct virtual interviews for head-coaching roles starting Wednesday. Had Detroit lost, they would have had to wait an additional week.\n\nJohnson is seen widely as one of the most in-demand coaching candidates after withdrawing from consideration during the last two hiring cycles. Glenn has kept the Lions defense rolling despite a bevy of injuries, and he has been linked to both the Jets and the Saints openings given his history with each franchise as a former player and assistant coach, respectively.\n\nNext up for Patriots: Mike Vrabel?\n\nOn a day designed to be defined by on-field action, the Patriots turned heads with what they did after the completion of another trying year.\n\nRobert Kraft fired coach Jerod Mayo after only one season in what the Patriots owned called \"one of the hardest decisions I have ever made.\"\n\nWith Kraft making an abrupt pivot on the coach he appointed to be Bill Belichick's successor, USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell sees the Patriots positioning themselves for one candidate in particular: Mike Vrabel. The former Tennessee Titans coach - and Patriots Hall of Famer after his storied playing career - is arguably the most enticing candidate on the market, and he already interview with the Jets last Friday.\n\nWhile the Patriots will still be required to adhere to the Rooney Rule in their interview process, expect Vrabel's presence to hang over the search. And read Bell's column on why the connection is so hard to shake.\n\nAntonio Pierce mum on status with Raiders after loss\n\nAfter the Las Vegas Raiders fell to the Los Angeles Chargers in their season finale, Antonio Pierce had no interest in ruminating on where he stood with the organization.\n\n\"No comment,\" Pierce said when asked about his job security.\n\nThe Silver and Black continue to keep everyone in the dark regarding Pierce's future. There's been little insight as to the team's plans since owner Mark Davis said at the league meeting in early December that he was \"very disappointed\" with this season's results.\n\nDespite Las Vegas falling to 4-13, several players – including record-setting rookie tight end Brock Bowers – backed Pierce amid the ongoing uncertainty. Now it's up to Davis to make clear if he wants to bring back the coach he saw fit to make his full-time head coach after his successful interim stint or start from scratch.\n\nPederson holding out hope on Jaguars future\n\nDoug Pederson might have had the hottest seat of any coach entering Week 18, but the leader of the Jacksonville Jaguars is still optimistic he'll be given a reprieve.\n\n\"I’ll find out this week,\" Pederson said after a 26-23 overtime loss to the Indianapolis Colts dropped the Jaguars to 4-13 on the season. \"It's hard to speculate right now. Emotions are running. I hope I’m still here, honestly. I feel like we have the makings of being a good football team. Our main guys need to get healthy, we need to continue to work hard. I’m optimistic and hopeful that happens.\"\n\nOwner Shad Khan seemed to put the pressure on before the season by saying this season's iteration of the Jaguars was the best team to be assembled in franchise history. He gave Pederson a vote of confidence after a 1-4 start and did not make a move after Jacksonville suffered its greatest deficit ever in a defeat with a 52-6 loss to the Detroit Lions.\n\nNo changes in Indianapolis as Irsay backs Shane Steichen, Chris Ballard\n\nBeing eliminated by a 45-33 loss to the New York Giants in Week 17 ramped up speculation that the Indianapolis Colts could shake things up by dismissing coach Shane Steichen and/or general manager Chris Ballard. After the season was completed Sunday, owner Jim Irsay moved quickly to confirm the duo would be sticking around another year.\n\n“I’ve been evaluating our entire operation, and I believe in Chris Ballard and Shane Steichen and our collective ability to make the improvements needed to take us to the next level in 2025,” Irsay wrote in a statement posted to social media. “I know fans who want an immediate change in leadership will be disappointed. That means we all have a lot to prove, so we’ll get back to work and keep doing what we can to earn your support and make you proud to be a Colts fan.”\n\nThe Colts have not been to the playoffs since the 2020 season and last won the AFC South title in the 2014 campaign. Since then, every other team in the division has claimed the crown at least twice.\n\nDolphins sticking with Mike McDaniel, Chris Grier\n\nDespite acknowledging that the Dolphins \"fell short of our expectations this season,\" owner Stephen Ross said he will keep coach Mike McDaniel and general manager Chris Grier in place.\n\n\"Their positive working relationship is an asset to the Dolphins, and I believe in the value of stability,\" Ross said in a statement Sunday. \"However, continuity in leadership is not to be confused with acceptance that status quo is good enough. We will take a hard look at where we have fallen sort and make the necessary changes to deliver our ultimate goal of building and sustaining a winning team that competes for championships.\"\n\nMiami finished 8-9 for the Dolphins' first losing season since 2019.\n\nOne of the first offseason tasks for McDaniel and Grier: get clarity on how to proceed with Tyreek Hill after the five-time All-Pro wide receiver indicated he would like to leave.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/09/18/mike-mcdaniel-miami-dolphins-update/86229409007/", "title": "Will the Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel?

His previous three years have yielded two playoff berths but no wins and the team's finished second to the Bills at best in the AFC East.\n\nThis tough start – including the biggest loss of Week 1, a 33-8 shellacking to the Indianapolis Colts – has called into question how much longer McDaniel will be at the helm in Miami.\n\nSix of the coaches hired in the same year as McDaniel have already been fired: Matt Eberflus (Chicago), Nathaniel Hackett (Denver), Lovie Smith (Houston), Doug Pederson (Jacksonville), and Josh McDaniels (Las Vegas).\n\nMiami is one of the biggest underdogs of the week on Thursday night against Buffalo. With another loss, could McDaniel be fired? Here's what we know.\n\nWill the Dolphins fire Mike McDaniel?\n\nThough an 0-3 start would be his worst since coming to Miami, it seems unlikely that the Dolphins would fire McDaniel if he loses to the Bills in Week 3.\n\nSome NFL analysts believe it's another loss one week from now that could be the difference maker.\n\nESPN's Peter Schrager said today that a loss in Week 4 at home to the New York Jets may be too much to overcome.\n\n\"Monday Night Football, Jets versus Dolphins in Miami,\" Schrager said. \"If you get blown out tonight, it's not good and there will be people calling for McDaniel's head. If you lose to the Jets in Week 4 and start the season off 0-4 and losing on national TV two weeks in a row... that's when we really start talking about this.\n\n\"But I don't think a loss to the Bills, who are Super Bowl contenders, is going to be the reason Mike McDaniel loses his job.\"\n\nNFL Network's Cameron Wolfe reported that the players he spoke to are frustrated with this start so far but aren't quitting on McDaniel.\n\n\"No one expressed panic and no one said they've quit on their head coach,\" he said. \"Talking to people around this team, I'm told that it simply would simply be too soon for most people's estimation for a move of that consideration.\"\n\nMike McDaniel coaching stats\n\nSince McDaniel arrived in Miami, the Dolphins rank 14th in the league in wins with 28 but ninth in points scored.

The Cleveland Browns coach, coming off a playoff berth last year, wasn't necessarily one of them. But now the Browns (2-8) enter Week 12 \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Pittsburgh Steelers off to the franchise's worst start since 2017, and suddenly Stefanski's name is being brought up in sports talk radio segments in Cleveland as an NFL head coach in danger of being fired.\n\n\"I think probably because I grew up listening to (Philadelphia radio), I'm smart enough to not worry about outside noise,\" Stefanski told reporters Tuesday. \"I get that's part of this gig. That's life in the big city. My sole focus is getting this team ready to get a win on Thursday night. That's it.\"\n\nThe coaching carousel is, at this point, a familiar part of the rhythm that exists within the NFL calendar. There were eight new head coaches this season. There have been, on average, seven teams that got rid of their head coach over the past five years. The New York Jets already made Robert Saleh the first NFL head coach fired this season after Week 5, and the New Orleans Saints became the second team to make a midseason coaching change when it let go Dennis Allen earlier this month.\n\nThe moves have only further stoked speculation about the next coach to be fired, and who else appears to be on the hot seat as playoff hopefuls fade and disappointing teams finish out their schedule. Here's a sampling of some of the odds, predictions and hot seat lists now that the end of the 2024 NFL regular season is less than two months away.\n\nExpert MLB daily picks: Unique MLB betting insights only at USA TODAY\n\nNFL WEEK 12 PICKS: Odds and predictions for every matchup\n\nNFL coach hot seat rankings\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Cincinnati Bengals, Las Vegas Raiders and Cleveland Browns are among the NFL teams that analysts are predicting could (or should) consider a coaching change based off what's happening during the 2024 season.\n\nDoug Pederson, Jacksonville Jaguars Matt Eberflus, Chicago Bears Mike McCarthy, Dallas Cowboys Zac Taylor, Cincinnati Bengals Antonio Pierce, Las Vegas Raiders Kevin Stefanski, Cleveland Browns\n\nDoug Pederson, Jacksonville Jaguars Mike McCarthy, Dallas Cowboys Brian Daboll, New York Giants Matt Eberflus, Chicago Bears Antonio Pierce, Las Vegas Raiders Kevin Stefanski, Cleveland Browns\n\nNFL next coach fired odds\n\nJacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Pederson and Chicago Bears coach Matt Eberflus are the favorites to be the next NFL head coach fired before Week 12 of the 2024 season.\n\nThe Jaguars (2-9) are currently in last place in the AFC South. Pederson, who won a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017 and took Jacksonville to the NFL divisional round in 2022, has lost 14 of his past 17 games dating back to last season.\n\nThe Bears (4-6) have lost four games in a row and Eberflus, on track for his third consecutive season with a sub-.500 record, had to fire offensive coordinator Shane Waldron less than a year after hiring him this past offseason.

See the history of midseason NFL coach ...", "text": "Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel is on the hot seat after a disappointing 2024 season and an 0-2 start in 2025.\n\nThe last time Miami fired a coach midseason was in 2015, when Joe Philbin was dismissed after Week 4.\n\nSince 2014, teams have had better records after firing their coach before the end of the season. But with some exceptions, that hasn't led to a vast improvement.\n\nFour years ago, Mike McDaniel became head coach of the Miami Dolphins with the promise of a lightning-fast offense built on a dynamic run game. Tom Brady's departure the previous season meant New England's two-decade reign atop the AFC East was over, and with an exciting young quarterback in Tua Tagovailoa and the offseason addition of game-breaking receiver Tyreek Hill, fans in South Florida figured a Super Bowl was within reach.\n\nIt didn't pan out. The Dolphins are 0-2 with losses to those Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, two teams without high expectations for the season. For Week 3 they have a Thursday night matchup with the Buffalo Bills, the team that took the mantle as divisional overlords from under their noses. And McDaniel is considered by many football pundits as most likely to be the first coach fired in 2025.\n\nIf the Bills destroy the Dolphins and send them to 0-3 for the first time since 2019, there's a chance general manger Chris Grier could bring the hammer down (some fans might like to see owner Stephen Ross axe them both). The Dolphins effectively have a full bye week before their next game, a Monday night matchup Sept. 29 against the New York Jets. And while firing the coach three weeks in might seem drastic, it would be following a recent trend of early resets in the NFL.\n\nNFL coaches fired midseason\n\nAl Davis made waves when he fired Lane Kiffin in 2008, both because it came just four games into the Oakland Raiders' season and because he laid out a lengthy presentation to reporters with aid from an overhead projector. His son and successor, Mark Davis, fired Dennis Allen after Week 4 of the 2014 season. Ten years later, Allen would be fired by the New Orleans Saints after Week 9, giving him the dubious honor of the only NFL head coach to get the midseason pink slip twice.\n\nThe Raiders' proclivity for quick firings has continued over the past few years, but they didn't invent the idea. Seattle fired Jack Patera, the Seahawks' first ever head coach, after starting 0-2 in 1982 in the middle of a strike. And in 1978, the legendary George Allen was fired from the Los Angeles Rams after two preseason games.\n\nThe Dolphins have gone down this road before. Ten years ago, Joe Philbin was let go after Miami returned from a Week 4 loss in London. He was replaced for the rest of the season by tight ends coach Dan Campbell, who would rise to fame in his current head coaching gig with the Detroit Lions.\n\nDoes firing a coach midseason work?\n\nSince 2014, 19 coaches have been fired midseason with more teams recently willing to abandon ship before the end of the year (three coaches were shown the door early in each of the past three years). Over that time, teams are 64-169-3 before firing their coach (a .278 win percentage) and 60-155 the rest of their season (.343). While that is an improvement, as an analysis by Forbes states, \"it is typically not enough to alter a team’s playoff chances or provide a long-term fix. Midseason firings often reflect a need to change direction and appease fans and stakeholders, signaling that the team is actively addressing its struggles.\"\n\nWhere would firing Mike McDaniel rank among the earliest firings in recent history? Here's a look back at the last 10 years of the first coaches fired in each NFL season:\n\nRobert Saleh | New York Jets, 2024\n\nThe Jets fired Robert Saleh on Oct. 8, after Week 5 of the 2024 season. New York went 2-3 under Saleh and 3-9 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich. Saleh finished 20-36 in three-plus seasons in New York. The Jets hired Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn to fill the role for 2025.\n\nJosh McDaniels | Las Vegas Raiders, 2023\n\nThe Raiders fired Josh McDaniels on Nov. 1, after Week 8 of the 2023 season. Las Vegas went 3-5 under McDaniels and 5-4 under interim coach Antonio Pierce, who was named full-time head coach over the offseason but was fired after a 4-13 season in 2024. McDaniels finished 9-16 over one-plus season in Las Vegas.\n\nMatt Rhule | Carolina Panthers, 2022\n\nThe Panthers fired Matt Rhule on Oct. 10, after Week 5 of the 2022 season. Carolina went 1-4 under Rhule and 6-6 under interim coach Steve Wilks. Rhule finished 11-27 over two-plus seasons in Carolina. The Panthers hired former Colts head coach Frank Reich to fill the role for 2023, only to fire him after a 1-10 start.\n\nJon Gruden | Las Vegas Raiders, 2021\n\nJon Gruden resigned Oct. 11, after Week 5 of the 2021 season. Las Vegas went 3-2 under Gruden and 7-5 under interim coach Rich Bisaccia, making the playoffs at 10-7. Gruden finished 11-10 in one-plus season during his second stint as Raiders coach. The Raiders hired Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to fill the role in 2022 (we've seen what happened there).\n\nBill O'Brien | Houston Texans, 2020\n\nThe Texans fired Bill O'Brien on Oct. 5, after Week 4 of the 2020 season. Houston went 0-4 under O'Brien and 4-8 under interim coach Romeo Crennel. O'Brien finished 52-48 over six-plus seasons in Houston. The Texas hired David Culley to fill the role in 2021, then fired him after a 4-13 campaign.\n\nJay Gruden | Washington Commanders, 2019\n\nWashington fired Jay Gruden on Oct. 7, after Week 5 of the 2019 season. Washington went 0-5 under Gruden and 3-8 under interim coach Bill Callahan. Gruden finished 35-49-1 over five-plus seasons in Washington. The newly named Washington Football Team hired former Panthers head coach Ron Rivera to fill the role in 2020, and he went 26-40-1 over four seasons there.\n\nHue Jackson | Cleveland Browns, 2018\n\nThe Browns fired Hue Jackson on Oct. 29, after Week 8 of the 2018 season. Cleveland went 2-5-1 under Jackson and 5-3 under interim coach Gregg Williams. Jackson finished 3-36-1 over two-plus seasons in Cleveland, including a 1-15 campaign in 2016 and the league's second 0-16 season in 2017. The Browns promoted running backs coach Freddie Kitchens to fill the role in 2019, and he went 6-10 in his lone season in charge.\n\nBen McAdoo | New York Giants, 2017\n\nThe Giants fired Ben McAdoo on Dec. 4, after Week 13 of the 2017 season. New York went 2-10 under McAdoo and 1-3 under interim coach Steve Spagnuolo. McAdoo finished 13-15 after one-plus season in New York. The Giants hired Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur to fill the role in 2018, and he went 9-23 in two seasons.\n\nJeff Fisher | Los Angeles Rams, 2016\n\nThe Rams fired Jeff Fisher on Dec. 12, after Week 14 of the 2016 season. Los Angeles went 4-9 under Fisher and 0-3 under interim coach John Fassel. Fisher finished 31-45-1 over four-plus seasons with the Rams. LA hired Washington offensive coordinator Sean McVay to fill the role in 2017, and in his first eight seasons he has gone 80-52 with two Super Bowl appearances, including a win after the 2021 season.\n\nJoe Philbin | Miami Dolphins, 2015\n\nThe Dolphins fired Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, after Week 4 of the 2015 season. Miami went 1-3 under Philbin and 5-7 under interim coach Dan Campbell. Philbin finished 24-28 over three-plus seasons in Miami. The Dolphins hired Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase to fill the role in 2016, and he went 23-25 in three seasons.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/01/08/black-nfl-coaches-higher-standards/77543787007/", "title": "Why Black fired NFL coaches face a harsher standard than most", "text": "Antonio Pierce, gone.\n\nBrian Callahan, staying.\n\nJerod Mayo, gone.\n\nBrian Daboll, staying.\n\nRan Carthon, gone.\n\nTrent Baalke, staying.\n\nNow take an NFL version of the Rorschach test. See the pattern?\n\nPierce, Mayo and Carthon are Black. And they were given the NFL equivalent of a New York minute to prove themselves on their high-powered jobs before they were fired this week with horrific win-loss records.\n\nCallahan, Daboll and Baalke are white. Their win-loss records stink, too. Yet they will be back in their high-powered jobs, afforded more time to prove themselves. Or not.\n\nSure, every case includes unique details, and the Black men weren’t the only coaches and front office executives forced to walk the plank as NFL teams ignited another hiring and firing cycle.\n\nYet in a league that for generations has had such a sorry track record when it comes to providing opportunities to minorities, while trumpeting a creed of equality, some of the biggest moves (and non-moves) this week underscore another disturbing pattern that the NFL needs to be called on the carpet for.\n\nYou’ve heard of “sham” interviews. That suspicion prompted Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores, following his stint as Miami Dolphins coach, to file a still unresolved class-action lawsuit against the NFL and several teams, alleging racial discrimination and phony interviews to comply with the Rooney Rule.\n\nWell, the evil twin is “sham” opportunities.\n\nAccording to data collected as part of USA TODAY Sports’ NFL Coaches Project, since the Rooney Rule was instituted in 2003, non-white coaches have been more than three times as likely to be fired after one season (as was the case with Pierce and Mayo) than white coaches. The Rooney Rule, named after former Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching jobs and other key positions.\n\nConsider some raw numbers:\n\nOf the 139 head coaches in the NFL since 2003, 19 (13.7%) were fired after one season in at least one of their stints.\n\nOf the 111 white coaches during this span, 11 (9.7%) were one-and-done.\n\nOf the 26 non-white coaches, eight (30.8%) lasted just one season.\n\nNo, don’t call it a \"double\" standard. It’s more like minority coaches in the NFL have to endure a “triple\" standard.\n\nAnd this doesn’t even account for cases where Black coaches were fired after several seasons, such as Lovie Smith and Jim Caldwell, despite posting winning records.\n\nWhile there are certainly examples of teams who have embodied the spirit of the Rooney Rule, the collective rate of quickly rescinding opportunities for minority coaches is another illustration of how the league is failing on the equality front. Still.\n\nPierce, promoted nearly a year ago to become the Las Vegas Raiders coach after impressive impact in 2023 as interim coach (5-4), was dumped after a 4-13 finish. First-year GM Tom Telesco, by the way, has been retained.\n\nMayo, promoted nearly a year ago from his post as linebackers coach to succeed Bill Belichick as New England Patriots coach, was fired after a 4-13 season. It didn’t matter that Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who admitted he placed the rookie coach in an “untenable position” – inheriting a team decidedly thin on talent – created a succession plan in 2023 that contractually designated Mayo as his future coach.\n\nCompare the Pierce and Mayo cases with that of Callahan, who just finished 3-14 in his first year as Tennessee Titans coach. Callahan, too, was a head coach for the first time. Yet the team apparently hasn’t blinked in bringing him back.\n\n“He was a first-time head coach, and a first-time play-caller,” Chad Brinker, the Titans’ president of football operations, said Tuesday, his comments published on the team’s website. \"There are some challenges as a first-time head coach, like building a culture, assessing current and future talent, establishing trust and communication, creating an alignment from the coaching to the front office to ownership.”\n\nHmmm. No knock on Callahan. Good for him. He’ll get support and more time. If only Pierce and Mayo were afforded such a luxury.\n\nBrinker added: 'We believe in Brian, and we want to give him the opportunity to grow into the head coach that we think he can be…It just takes time to build a program.”\n\nTime. Ask the Detroit Lions. Dan Campbell was 3-13-1 in his first season in 2021. By sticking with Campbell and GM Brad Holmes, the Lions have reversed their pattern of futility. The past two seasons, the Lions are 29-8, including postseason, and they just clinched the No. 1 seed for the upcoming season NFC playoffs.\n\nLook at the San Francisco 49ers. They didn’t qualify for the playoffs this season, but advanced to two Super Bowls in the previous five seasons under Kyle Shanahan. His first two seasons? They were 6-10 and 4-12. He was given time.\n\nPierce and Mayo, though, weren’t given much of a window, benefit of the doubt and obviously the support, to, well, grow into the job as Brinker envisions for Callahan.\n\nWere they set up to fail? It sure looks like it. It’s fair to question whether they should have been hired in the first place if they weren’t going to get a solid commitment from Kraft and Raiders owner Mark Davis. Neither Pierce nor Mayo had worked before as coordinators. Then again, Callahan, previously the Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator, had never called plays before becoming a head coach. So, there’s always a certain risk in hiring unproven, first-time coaches. Regardless, time matters.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Giants have stuck with their first-time coach. Daboll, flanked by GM Joe Schoen, stays after a 3-14 finish in his third season. Giants co-owner John Mara talked this week about his patience wearing thin. But it’s not as thin as the patience Pierce and Mayo were not afforded.\n\nThen there’s Carthon, fired after compiling a 9-25 record in two seasons as Titans GM. With more time, perhaps he could have matched – or exceeded – the 26-44 mark that Baalke has had in four seasons as Jacksonville Jaguars GM.\n\nYet he, too, is gone. Baalke survived while the Jaguars fired coach Doug Pederson, who in producing a 4-13 record in 2024 didn’t do enough with the roster Jaguars owner Shad Khan hailed as the most talented one he’s had during his ownership reign.\n\nUntil this week, speculation persisted that both Pederson and Baalke wouldn’t be back.\n\nHad Carthon returned, he would have had the No. 1 pick overall in the upcoming NFL draft his war chest. Now that’s an asset for Brinker, who Carthon hired last year as his assistant GM.\n\nIt’s reminiscent of the fate Steve Wilks encountered during brief stint with the Arizona Cardinals in 2018. Wilks was gone before the Cardinals could use the No. 1 pick overall in 2019 on Kyler Murray.\n\nThe next Patriots coach will inherit a windfall, too, as in $95 million-plus in salary cap space in 2025 — largest in the NFL. Tough timing, I guess, that Mayo didn’t get that perk when he followed in Belichick’s footsteps.\n\nCarthon, on the other hand, might wonder how he wound up as the odd man out after hiring Brinker and leading the search to hire Callahan just last year. Talk about weird optics. Brinker, who spent 13 years in personnel with the Green Bay Packers, came in under Carthon. Then he was fast-tracked for a promotion. Now Brinker suddenly wields the power to make the final decisions on personnel — and the authority to hire the next GM.\n\nGiven NFL trends, it’s probably a good bet that he’ll get more time to pass or fail than Carthon ever had.\n\nContributing: Thomas Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2025/09/21/hot-seat-rankings-head-coaches-winless-teams/86221088007/", "title": "Hot seat rankings for 10 head coaches of 0-2 NFL teams", "text": "Parity is off to a strong start in the 2025 NFL season. Through two weeks, 10 teams are 2-0, 12 teams are 1-1 and 10 teams are 0-2.\n\nWith 10 teams yet to win a game in 2025, it's fair to start asking which head coaches are sitting on a hot seat ahead of Week 3. Some of the coaches of 0-2 teams are beyond safe in their jobs – looking at you, Kansas City Chiefs' Andy Reid – while others might need to start remembering their LinkedIn passwords.\n\nWith a wide range of figurative temperatures on head coaching seats through two weeks, USA TODAY Sports ranked all 10 teams off to an 0-2 start by how likely they are to fire their head coaches.\n\nRanking NFL head coach hot seats for 0-2 teams\n\nCompletely safe\n\n10. Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nVanilla Ice might as well have been describing the temperature of Reid's proverbial \"hot seat\" when he said, \"Ice, ice, baby.\" Reid's three Super Bowl wins – and five AFC titles – as the Chiefs' head coach have earned him plenty of breathing room to get through an 0-2 start without any serious questioning whether he'll be fired.\n\n9. Ben Johnson, Chicago Bears\n\nThe Bears had never fired a head coach during the regular season in their 100-plus-year history – until they fired Matt Eberflus last year. The 2025 season should be the start of a new streak. It's Johnson's first year, he was the hottest name on the head coaching market last offseason, and his early returns have been solid on his work with second-year quarterback Caleb Williams. Johnson has room to work in 2025, even if he's still chasing his first win.\n\n8. Kellen Moore, New Orleans Saints\n\nThrough two games as the Saints' head coach, Moore has made a team coming off of a 12-loss season look competitive. New Orleans has yet to win a game, but their two losses are by one score and young gunslinger Spencer Rattler is off to a solid start. Like Johnson, Moore's status as a first-year head coach and early impact on the offense allow him breathing room.\n\nA couple of degrees above what is comfortable\n\n7. Aaron Glenn, New York Jets\n\nWelcome to the New York media market, Aaron Glenn. After a shootout loss to former Jet Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers, then a blowout loss to the divisional rival Bills, some fans an analysts are ready to start sounding the alarm on Glenn. Realistically, though, Glenn's job should be safe as a first-year head coach. A two-game sample size is not enough to evaluate Glenn's efforts thus far as a failure, but the New York media market's swiftness to pile on the latest Jets head coach only makes the hot seat feel a little warmer than is desirable.\n\n6. DeMeco Ryans, Houston Texans\n\nIn Ryans' first two seasons as the Texans' head coach, Houston has gone 10-7 both times and won a playoff game. That includes a 2023 in which the Texans began the season 0-2. Houston's two losses this year are by a combined six points against two fellow playoff contenders from 2024, both from the NFC side of the bracket. As quarterback C.J. Stroud gets used to a re-tooled offensive line and new offensive coordinator, he and Ryans will get some well-earned patience to start 2025.\n\nThe seat is hot\n\n5. Dave Canales, Carolina Panthers\n\nThe Panthers hired Canales before the 2024 season with the mission to develop 2023 No. 1 overall pick and quarterback Bryce Young. After two weeks in charge, at this time last year, Canales benched Young in favor of veteran Andy Dalton. Young eventually returned to the starting job six weeks later after Dalton was injured in a car accident, and he returned looked more like the quarterback prospect that earned his No. 1 overall pick status down the home stretch. To start the 2025 season, Young has showed some worrying signs of possible regression to pre-benching form, and that combined with the Panthers' 0-2 start makes Canales' seat quite a bit warmer.\n\n4. Kevin Stefanski, Cleveland Browns\n\nStefanski and the Browns followed up a strong 2023 season – featuring an 11-6 record and playoff appearance – with a 3-14 campaign in 2024, tying for the league's worst record. This offseason, Stefanski had to navigate a messy quarterback situation featuring four different healthy signal-callers in a battle for the starting job. He eventually named veteran Joe Flacco the winner and has been rewarded with an 0-2 record, sinking his head coach record to 40-46, and an offensive EPA that ranks among the league's worst. If Cleveland has another losing season, it would be the fourth in Stefanski's six seasons.\n\n3. Brian Daboll, New York Giants\n\nThe only things keeping Daboll from joining the ranks of the hottest tier on this list is his work developing rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart – results still TBD as Dart has yet to attempt a pass in the regular season – and the Giants' strong effort in an eventual overtime loss in Dallas last week. But Daboll is now 18-34-1 in three seasons (and two games) as the Giants' head coach after helping lead them to the playoffs in 2022. The end of the Daniel Jones era was a disaster, former defensive coordinator Wink Martindale reportedly stormed out of the Giants' building after a screaming match with Daboll before resigning, and team owner John Mara said he's \"just about run out of patience\" after last season. Make no mistake, Daboll's seat is quite hot, regardless of the leash he earned by drafting Dart.\n\nSeat's on fire\n\n2. Brian Callahan, Tennessee Titans\n\nCallahan doesn't have the luxury of keeping his rookie quarterback shrouded in mystery. No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward debuted with his first start in Week 1, and early returns have been less-than promising. After a 3-14 2024 season, the Titans are 0-2 and the Ward-led offense is among the NFL's worst in points per game (15.5, 30th in the NFL) offensive EPA (-0.261, 31st) and yards per game (192.5, 32nd). Not great for an offensive-minded head coach who also calls the plays. Add in the fact that he didn't know the NFL's rules about what constituted a catch in his explanation to not challenge a play Week 1, and, yeah, Callahan's seat is red-hot.\n\n1. Mike McDaniel, Miami Dolphins\n\nFans are already paying to fly banners above Hard Rock Stadium that call for McDaniel to be fired. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa grades out as PFF's 32nd of 34 quarterbacks so far this year, and the defense has allowed 33 points per game, the second-most of any team in the league. McDaniel's failure to make offensive adjustments after Tagovailoa's injury last year drew scrutiny, and his 0-3 start this year has done nothing to quell concerns.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jets/2024/10/08/robert-saleh-fired-new-york-jets-coach/75568960007/", "title": "Robert Saleh fired: Jets drop head coach after 2-3 start to season", "text": "Robert Saleh quite obviously entered the 2024 NFL season on the hot seat. Tuesday morning, the New York Jets hit his eject button.\n\nFollowing a highly disappointing 2-3 start − and what appeared to be ongoing friction with superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers – team owner Woody Johnson had seen enough, and Saleh became the first head coach in the league fired this season.\n\n\"This morning, I informed Robert Saleh that he will no longer serve as the Head Coach of the Jets,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"I thanked him for his hard work these past three-and-a-half years and wished him and his family well moving forward. This was not an easy decision, but we are not where we should be given our expectations, and I believe now is the best time for us to move in a different direction.\n\n\"(Defensive coordinator) Jeff Ulbrich will serve as our Interim Head Coach for the remainder of the season. He is a tough coach who has the respect of the coaches and players on this team. I believe he along with the coaches on this staff can get the most out of our talented team and attain the goals we established this offseason.\"\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Where do Jets land?\n\nThus ends another disappointing tenure for an NYJ coach, Saleh finishing with a 20-36 record in three-plus seasons.\n\nDespite consistently good defenses, the bread and butter for a longtime NFL assistant and coordinator, Saleh, 45, was undone by long-chronic quarterback issues – first Zach Wilson, the No. 2 pick of the 2021 draft who was a near-total bust, and Rodgers. The four-time MVP kindled fresh Super Bowl hopes for the franchise upon being acquired from the Green Bay Packers in 2023. But after last year's Week 1 Achilles injury ended Rodgers' season after four snaps, this season's turbulent start was apparently too much for Johnson, who said during the offseason that he expected major results in 2024, to bear.\n\nDespite another fourth-quarter opportunity to win, the Jets lost their second straight game Sunday to the Minnesota Vikings in London, the Rodgers-led offense noticeably struggling after showing progress in Weeks 2 and 3. But the quarterback's timing with receivers has obviously been off, Rodgers has taken too many hits lately, and the run game – despite the presence of explosive back Breece Hall – ranks last in the league with 80.4 yards per game. Those cascading issues have fueled growing speculation that GM Joe Douglas could (and should) trade for unhappy Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams, a Pro Bowler five times during the eight seasons he spent with Rodgers as his quarterback for the Packers.\n\nBut Saleh, whose defense has ranked in the top five each of the past three seasons, ultimately took the fall. He and Rodgers consistently defended their relationship – answering questions about matters like their sideline interactions and whether Rodgers' famous pre-snap cadence was compromising offensive rhythm.\n\n\"(W)e're really good friends. We enjoy each other,\" Rodgers said of Saleh as recently as Friday.\n\n\"We spend time with each other almost every day in his office talking about things and the energy of the team, the focus of the team, what we need to get done, how I can help him out, how he can help me out, so we got a great relationship.\"\n\nYet that answer ultimately didn't erase speculation that the 10-time Pro Bowler had at least as much influence at Jets headquarters as his now-former coach, nor did it produce a win that might have saved Saleh's job.\n\n“We have all this talent, and we have to deploy talent properly. … This is it. This is the time to go. We’ve got to produce this year,” Johnson said February during Super Bowl week, following Saleh's second consecutive 7-10 campaign.\n\n“We have to do a lot better than seven (victories), definitely.”\n\nPrior to Tuesday, Johnson had never switched coaches during a season since he bought the Jets in 2000. The last time the NYJ needed an interim coach was 1976, when Lou Holtz resigned following a 3-10 start before taking the head job at the University of Arkansas.\n\n\"(T)he NFL is built for chaos. Either the sky is falling, or you've got Super Bowl aspirations, there's no in between anymore,\" Saleh said Monday in what turned out to be his final news conference.\n\n\"The reality is what the standings look like now are going to be completely different at the end of the season. There's so much football to be played. There's so much, so many things that we can get better at and there's so many things that we can continue to build on, the things that we are doing well. So, I'm not panicked, nobody in the building is panicked.\"\n\nThe Jets haven't won more than seven games since 2015, when they went 10-6. They last reached the playoffs in 2010, their 13-season absence the NFL's longest active one. Their only Super Bowl appearance occurred following the 1968 season, when the upstart AFL team, led by brash quarterback Joe Namath, shocked the NFL's heavily favored Baltimore Colts 16-7 in Super Bowl 3, widely considered as one of the most important games in the history of pro football.\n\nBut these Jets suddenly don't seem much closer to ending the franchise's championship drought.\n\n(This story has been updated to include new information and video.)\n\nAll the players and the plays: Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter for NFL news.\n\nWoody Johnson statement\n\nJets' record with Robert Saleh\n\nAfter being hired in 2021, Saleh went 20-36 as the Jets' head coach.\n\n2021: 4-13\n\n2022: 7-10\n\n2023: 7-10\n\n2024: 2-3\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter, @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/12/30/nfl-black-monday-2019-coaches-fired/2412755002/", "title": "NFL Black Monday 2019: What Coaches Are Being Fired?", "text": "Why is the Monday directly following the last game of the NFL season each year so important in the NFL?\n\nIt is typically the day that most NFL teams fire their head coach, and/or coordinators, and/or general managers after a season of unfulfilled expectations.\n\nSome teams don't even wait till this \"official day\" any more like the Cleveland Browns (who are always firing coaches) and the Green Bay Packers, who made a rare change.\n\nThe mid-season causalities were former Cleveland Browns coach Hue Jackson and former Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy.\n\nNow, we're awaiting the reports of the next wave of firings. So, follow along as the announcements come after the NFL Week 17 games.\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS (FIRED)\n\nThe Miami Dolphins made the playoffs in the 2016 with a 10-6 record, which was head coach Adam Gase’s first season with the team. But since then, Gase has gone 6-10 in 2017 and 7-9 in 2018. His job reportedly was on the line coming into this season and with another losing season completed…it was just a matter of time before he was let go, according to multiple NFL sources. The guessing game with Gase’s status is over and he’s been fired, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. In addition to the Gase firing, Schefter reported that the Dolphins made some front office changes concerning former Executive Vice-President Mike Tannenbaum.\n\nDolphins dismiss head coach Adam Gase\n\nCINCINNATI BENGALS (MUTUALLY PARTED WAYS)\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals were guided by Marvin Lewis for 16 seasons and in that time he compiled a 131-122-3 record. But the glaring \"black eye\" on his resume was an 0-7 record in the playoffs and that's what finally cost Lewis his job. Lewis told his coaching staff that he wasn't coming back, according to the NFL Network's Tom Pelissero. Many people thought the team was going to fire Lewis last season but owner Mike Brown brought him back for one more year and the Bengals went 6-10, which was the team's third straight losing season. The Bengals released a statement saying that \"the Cincinnati Bengals have decided to mutually part ways with head coach Marvin Lewis. The team will begin the search for a new head coach immediately. It expects to review many candidates and anticipates that the process will last several weeks.\"\n\nBengals part ways with Marvin Lewis\n\nDENVER BRONCOS (FIRED)\n\nAs of Sunday night, there was no official word on the status of the Denver Broncos head coaching job, but John Elway, the Denver Broncos president of football operations/general manager, flirted with the idea of canning head coach Vance Joseph last season in what would have been a \"one-and-done\" situation in the mile high city. But it appears that Joseph will not survive this year's NFL Black Monday situation. Fox NFL Insider Jay Glazer said on Fox NFL Sunday that he believes Vance Joseph will be one of the coaches fired for the NFL's Black Monday. Joseph didn't have to wait long on Monday morning to find out his fate as Elway fired him, according to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. Joseph didn't have a great quarterback in his two seasons in the mile high city as he went 5-11 last season and 6-10 this season. He left the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator position to take the Broncos head coaching job and according to NFL sources, he might land as a team's defensive coordinator for the 2019 season.\n\nBroncos fire Vance Joseph in latest shake-up\n\nARIZONA CARDINALS (FIRED)\n\nAs of Sunday night, there was no official word from the Arizona Cardinals on the status of its head coach but reports over the last week have Steve Wilks as a \"one-and-done\" NFL head coach. Fox NFL Insider Jay Glazer said on Fox NFL Sunday that he believes Steve Wilks will be one of the coaches fired for the NFL's Black Monday. The former Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator took over the Cardinals last season and has dealt with a bunch of injuries and with inserting rookie quarterback Josh Rosen into the starting lineup. But even with all that, it appears that Wilks will not get a chance to \"run it back.\" On Monday morning, the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Arizona Cardinals coach Steve Wilks met with his staff Monday morning to tell them he will not be back as head coach.\n\nSteve Wilks tells coaching staff that he will not be back as Cardinals coach\n\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (FIRED)\n\nEarly Sunday morning, Fox NFL Insider Jay Glazer said on Fox NFL Sunday that he believes coach Dirk Koetter will be one of the coaches fired during the NFL's Black Monday situation this year. Well, Koetter didn't have to wait till Monday morning to get the news. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter Koetter was fired Sunday night. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport added more information with a statement from #Bucs chairman Joel Glazer. ESPN's Adam Schefter also reported that Buccaneers’ general manager Jason Licht is leading the team’s search for a new coach.\n\nBuccaneers opt to move on from coach Koetter\n\nNEW YORK JETS (FIRED)\n\nThe speculation was out there early as the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported on Sunday morning that New York Jets coach Todd Bowles will be fired at some point after Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. Bowles had one winning season with the Jets, his first season when the Jets went 10-6, but since then it has been a pair of 5-11 seasons followed by a 4-12 record this season. Overall, he went 24-40 as the Jets head coach and that was one of the main reasons he was officially relieved of his coaching duties, according to the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. The Jets will begin the search for a new coach immediately, according to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.\n\nJets fire coach Todd Bowles, GM Maccagnan staying\n\nCLEVELAND BROWNS (FIRED)\n\nFormer Cleveland Browns Head Coach Hue Jackson and former Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator Todd Haley were both fired by the team on Oct. 29, 2018 following a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was rumored that Jackson and Haley didn't get along and Browns management had enough of the quarreling between the two men. The Browns named defensive coordinator Gregg Williams as the interim head coach for the remainder of the 2018 season. Williams isn't expected to inherit the job on a permanent basis, according to multiple NFL sources. In the meantime, Jackson joined the Cincinnati Bengals staff on Nov. 12, 2018 as a \"special assistant to the head coach.\"\n\nBrowns fire head coach Hue Jackson, OC Todd Haley\n\nGREEN BAY PACKERS (FIRED)\n\nFormer Green Bay Packers Head Coach Mike McCarthy was fired almost immediately after the Packers lost 20-17 to the 3-9 Arizona Cardinals on Dec. 2, 2018. It has been rumored for months that McCarthy, who has spent the last 13 seasons in Green Bay, and the team's star quarterback Aaron Rodgers were not getting along. McCarthy was on the \"hot seat\" when the season became and all indications were pointing toward his firing at the conclusion of the season, if the team didn't perform well. The Packers named offensive coordinator Joe Philbin as the team's interim head coach. Philbin isn't expected to inherit the job on a permanent basis, according to multiple NFL sources.\n\nPackers fire longtime coach McCarthy after loss\n\nJOBS RULED SAFE FOR THE 2019 SEASON\n\nCAROLINA PANTHERS (WILL RETURN)\n\nThe Carolina Panthers had a brutal 7-game losing streak from Nov. 8 to Dec. 23 this season and there was talk that could cost coach Ron Rivera his job. In fairness, quarterback Cam Newton played hurt in the later part of the season and the offense sputtered when everyone knew Newton couldn’t throw the ball very far downfield. The Panthers did win their final game of the season, 33-14, on Dec. 30, and keep in mind the Saints did rest some of their best players. But that win and Rivera leading the team to a 7-9 record despite the injury to Newton may have shifted the pendulum in Rivera’s favor. The speculation about Rivera's job ended with a report from the NFL Network's Mike Silver that Ron Rivera will return next season.\n\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (WILL RETURN)\n\nA year ago, The Jacksonville Jaguars were being considered as the \"heir apparent\" to the AFC title as they lost to the aging New England Patriots in last year's AFC title game. This season, the Jaguars underachieved immensely, especially on offense as quarterback Blake Bortles was benched. Despite all of that, Jaguars will not make a change at coach (Doug Marrone) or at general manager (Dave Caldwell), according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nSherlon Christie: @sherlonapp; schristie@gannettnj.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/30"}]}

With \"very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal,\" the Mayo Clinic notes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, when large amounts of cadmium are eaten, severe stomach irritation, vomiting and diarrhea can result.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry.

Retailers who have the products in stock are likewise advised not to sell them.\n\nIf you happen to find one of the affected meats in your fridge, be sure to follow up its disposal with a thorough cleaning of your fridge to prevent cross-contamination Retailers should likewise clean and sanitize all surfaces and discard any open meats and cheeses in the deli.\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid listeriosis is to avoid foods that have not been properly stored or that may be more prone to carrying listeria bacteria.

See affected ...", "text": "Although President Donald Trump's self-proclaimed \"Liberation Day\" has passed, American grocery shoppers' wallets may soon feel the impact of the reciprocal tariffs imposed on several of the country's trade partners earlier this week.\n\nFood industry analyst Phil Lempert told NPR that \"probably almost half of the products in a supermarket − about 40,000 products − will be affected by these tariffs, whether it's the entire product or just an ingredient.\"\n\nThe goal of Trump's round of recent tariffs is to boost domestic manufacturing by making it more expensive for international companies to ship products into the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump and the White House announced the reciprocal tariffs against nations that charge fees to U.S. imports, with higher tariffs for what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries with the largest trade surpluses and high tariff and non-tariff barriers, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Over the decades, they ripped us off like no country has never been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us, but it's substantial money for the country,\" Trump told reporters on March 30, per ABC News.\n\nThe reciprocal tariffs come after Trump decided to levy 20% tariffs on imports from China and 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada earlier this year. With inflation and tariffs severely affecting the U.S. economy, grocery shoppers may need to be more diligent in their couponing going forward.\n\nHere are some grocery items that could, and may not, see a price hike due to Trump's enacted reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWill avocadoes, other fruits be impacted?\n\nImpacts on fruit prices could be a mixed bag, with some tropical varieties from Central and South America likely to be affected, while others from our nearest neighbors − Canada and Mexico − escaping Trump's reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. received 51% of its fresh fruit from Mexico, and 2% from Canada, in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Both countries were not on the White House and Trump's chart of nations facing reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSome other top sources of imported fruit include Guatemala, Costa Rica and Peru. All three countries are on the White House's chart and were given 10% reciprocal tariffs.\n\nGuatemala, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Honduras are the main exporters of bananas to the U.S., according to the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Guatemala also ships melons, plantains and papayas, USDA said, while Costa Rica exports pineapples, avocados and mangoes.\n\n\"These products don't have a long shelf life, and with the tariffs, we're going to face significant issues with both price and availability,\" Lempert said about fruit, per NPR.\n\nWhile some fruits could see an increase in cost, Avocadoes may not be one of them.\n\nAvocados are one of the Mexican food items that the U.S. will be able to continue importing tariff-free, Reuters reported. Of the fresh avocados the U.S. imports, 87.6% come from Mexico, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data as of Jan. 7.\n\nWill vegetable costs increase?\n\nApproximately 69% of America's fresh vegetables came from Mexico, and 20% from Canada, in 2022, according to the USDA.\n\n\"The United States receives fresh vegetables from more than 125 different countries, but most imports originate from Mexico and Canada,\" the USDA states.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2020, the volume of fresh vegetable imports to the U.S. rose nearly 200%, and the value of fresh vegetable imports grew to exceed fresh exports by $7.6 billion, more than double the same figure a decade earlier, according to the government agency.\n\nWhile vegetables from Mexico and Canada may not be impacted by the reciprocal tariffs, veggies from other countries on the White House chart − including Guatemala, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Honduras, Morocco and China − could see an increase in cost.\n\nSeafood likely to become more expensive\n\nThe U.S. imports the vast majority of its seafood, up to 85%, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Due to this, and since several countries that supply fish and shellfish to the U.S. were among the hardest hit by tariffs, seafood will likely become more expensive going forward.\n\nChile, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are the largest suppliers of imported seafood, according to the USDA. All four countries are on the White House's chart, but Vietnam was hit with the highest tariffs at 46%, while Chile (10%), India (26%) and Indonesia (32%) followed behind.\n\n“About 70 to 80% of the U.S. seafood food supply is imported, and so that is not a number that the U.S. domestic industry can plug,” Andy Harig, vice president of tax, trade, sustainability and policy development at The Food Industry Association said, per Today. “So you’re going to see that the cost of the seafood department go up.”\n\nCoffee could become harder to buy\n\nThe U.S. is the world's largest importer of coffee, according to the USDA. About 80% of U.S. roasted imports come from Latin America, with more than 60% coming from just two countries — Brazil and Colombia, the agency said.\n\nBrazil and Colombia are both on the White House's chart, and they were both hit with 10% reciprocal tariffs.\n\nImported alcohol market 'likely to be clobbered'\n\nLempert said the imported alcohol market is likely \"to be clobbered\" due to the tariffs, according to NPR.\n\nAccording to USDA, the top import sources for wine include the European Union (France, Italy and Spain), New Zealand and Australia. The European countries were hit with 20% reciprocal tariffs, while New Zealand and Australia received 10% tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. imports most of its beer from Mexico and Canada, as well as the Netherlands and Ireland, which were both hit with 20% tariffs. Lempert added that beer sold in cans will also get doubly impacted due to tariffs on China and other aluminum producers.\n\nOlive oil prices could skyrocket\n\nEuropean Union, particularly Spain, Italy and Greece, are the top import sources for olive oil.\n\n\"Olive oil prices have gone through the roof,\" Lempert said, per NPR. \"They're going to go even higher.\"\n\nCertain cheeses imported from the European Union, especially Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, could see a price increase. Parmigiano-Reggiano, brie and Gouda are a few cheeses that may become costly.\n\nWhat grocery items may not increase in cost?\n\nSome grocery items that may not increase much, primarily because due to them being domestically produced, include beef and rice. While both these goods could remain relatively the same, they could raise a tad bit.\n\nAlthough 90% of beef consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced, tariffs could add to existing price increases that have raised costs to historic highs, and according to the USDA, the U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it's been since 1951.\n\nLike beef, rice sold in the U.S. is domestically produced, but nearly a third is imported, primarily jasmine rice from Thailand and basmati rice from India, the USDA states. Thailand and India are both on the White House chart.\n\nContributing: James Powel, Rachel Barber & Lori Comstock/ USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/consumers/2024/02/16/another-state-sues-to-block-kroger-albertsons-mega-25-billion-merger/72618925007/", "title": "Another state sues to block Kroger-Albertsons mega $25B merger", "text": "As Kroger Co. ramps up its efforts to tout the benefits of its proposed merger with supermarket rival Albertsons, the deal is facing more pushback from state officials, with some consumers concerned about the outcome.\n\nColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit on Feb. 14 seeking to block the $24.6 billion transaction.\n\nThat follows a similar lawsuit filed last month by the attorney general of Washington state.

To win a court order temporarily barring the deal from going through, regulators must convince U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson the agency has a “likelihood of ultimate success,” is “in the public interest” and prove the merger “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly,” according to federal law.\n\nWhat is the FTC seeking?\n\nAt issue is whether Nelson will grant a “preliminary injunction” that would block the deal while the FTC seeks to further fight the merger in a court in Washington, D.C. Antitrust experts say many deals collapse when they lose such court rulings because it means unacceptable and expensive delays. In opening arguments, a Kroger attorney warned the court the deal “will not occur” if it loses the ruling.\n\nAntitrust experts say it’s close but indicate the FTC might be making its case. Meanwhile, the companies seeking to create at $208 billion supermarket giant with 4,400 stores and 640,000 workers is stuck explaining why it benefits consumers to retire decades of fierce competition with each other. There have also been embarrassing disclosures and blunders that might undo the deal.\n\nWhat are the issues and how might they sway the hearing's results? Here are the key considerations:\n\nKroger: Our focus is Walmart\n\nDuring the hearing, no less than 10 Kroger executives testified, most stressing the company’s No. 1 competitor was discounter Walmart, not Albertsons.\n\nSeveral executives described how the Cincinnati-based supermarket chain’s strategy was to price thousands of items within a price “spread” just slightly more expensive (about 2% to 3% higher on the most sold items) than the world’s largest grocer but cheaper than traditional rivals like Albertsons. On the stand, Stuart Aitken, Kroger’s chief merchant and marketing officer, was the bluntest about his employer: It was “monomaniacally focused on Walmart.”\n\nBeyond that, Kroger considers any retailer that sells food a competitor, not just traditional supermarkets. Other retailers it's eyeing: Costco, Aldi, Trader Joe’s, Dollar General and Amazon (which also operates Whole Foods).\n\nThe FTC has countered Kroger and Albertsons are traditional “one-stop” grocers with a broader selection of goods and shouldn’t be allowed to combine because those nontraditional rivals are a poor substitute.\n\nDouglas Ross, an antitrust law professor at the University of Washington, said Kroger’s arguments were strong given that Walmart is already the world’s largest grocer.\n\n“It does seem like the narrow supermarket ‘market’ (part of the FTC’s theory for barring the deal) isn’t likely to describe how shoppers shop for very much longer,” Ross said.\n\nHe added the case eerily brought to mind two unsuccessful retail merger attempts of the past. In the late 1990s, Office Depot and Staples attempted to merge, also citing pressure from Walmart. In 2004, Blockbuster’s bid for Hollywood Video was abandoned after the FTC opposed it, citing monopoly concerns.\n\n“Within a few short years, Blockbuster and Hollywood Video were roadkill (to) Netflix,” Ross said.\n\nKroger, Albertsons monitor each other's prices\n\nA major problem that has emerged during the hearing that antitrust experts say could kill the merger is the detailed rivalry between Kroger and Albertsons.\n\nWhile Kroger executives said they were focused on tracking prices at Walmart, several also admitted they collected price check information from Albertsons, sometimes more than once a week. They described Albertsons’ and other traditional retailers’ prices as “a guard rail” for their prices – they wanted to keep below them on thousands of items.\n\nOn the stand, Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran also admitted he encouraged his team in emails to go after Kroger. He testified he ultimately wanted to compete better against Walmart, but Kroger’s pricing was closer, so he used them as a “motivator.”\n\nWilliam Kovacic, the director of the Competition Law Center at George Washington University, said two words to those rationales: “Nice try.”\n\nThe fact that Kroger and Albertsons collect so much information about each other’s pricing illustrates something regulators, and a quite possibly a federal judge, want to preserve for the benefit of consumers: They are competing.\n\n“It’s a real tricky part for Kroger and Albertsons. They can point to Walmart as the premier competitor,” Kovacic said. “But the (FTC) can win if they show that competition between Kroger and Albertsons is significant in and of itself.”\n\nIs $1 billion in promised savings to Albertsons' customers enough?\n\nDuring the hearing, Kroger has stressed its lower costs: Its prices on groceries average about 10% to 12% less than Albertsons. As a benefit of the efficiencies from the proposed merger, the company pledged to “invest” $1 billion into lowering prices for consumers.\n\nHowever, during the hearing Kroger officials indicated the $1 billion in savings won’t benefit all shoppers: The money would go toward lowering prices on acquired Albertsons stores. They also admitted it may take up to four years to implement all the cuts to get to the promised annual savings target. On the stand, one Kroger official was asked if the promised savings compared to the combined $200 billion in annual sales for both Kroger and Albertsons was just “pennies on the dollar?”\n\nIn an embarrassing moment, an executive admitted Kroger prices on eggs and milk at times increased faster than inflation, but he quickly added those items were also very volatile.\n\nChristine Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo, said the egg testimony could ding Kroger’s credibility on its pricing.\n\n“Undoubtedly, the milk and egg testimony hurts Kroger's claims on pricing,” she said, adding the company’s ability to charge customers more indicated pricing power that regulators won’t want to increase. “It is difficult to accept an argument that the companies must merge to survive when they are still raising prices … Combined, that increase in market power signals significant risk to customers' pocketbooks in the form of higher prices.”\n\n‘C&S is not Haggen’ but its proposed transformation is risky\n\nFor nearly two years, Kroger’s proposal to take over Albertsons has been haunted by the ghost of a disastrous divestiture when Albertsons bought Safeway in 2015. That year, Washington-based regional grocer Haggen acquired nearly 150 stores but struggled to operate them and filed for bankruptcy months later. Many of the divested stores were re-acquired by Albertsons, while others closed.\n\nSeeking to mollify competitive concerns, Kroger and Albertsons cut a deal to sell off 579 stores to Keene, New Hampshire-based C&S Wholesale Grocers if their merger is approved. A Fortune 500 company with strong financial resources, C&S Wholesale has still garnered criticism as a potential buyer because of its limited retail presence: It owns and operates less than two dozen supermarkets. Not only does C&S Wholesale Grocers have a limited retail footprint, it has a history of buying and selling off supermarkets. Also, while still a large company, its sales have declined in the past five years after losing its largest wholesale client, Ahold Delhaize.\n\nC&S Wholesale executives testified during the hearing their recent struggles are nothing to worry about but rather part of bigger plan to transform the company into a hybrid wholesaler-retailer. If the deal is approved, its retail operations would top 600 stores and command about $20 billion in retail sales.\n\nRoss said the divestiture deal is key to winning approval: if a well-financed competitor acquires the stores, it could be argued consumers are not losing a competitor but getting a new one.\n\n“While many people have focused on the famous Haggen failure, C&S is not Haggen – it is much stronger and far more likely to succeed,” Ross said.\n\nWill a C&S Wholesale executive’s messages blow the whole deal?\n\nA senior executive’s texts trashing the Kroger stores her company is buying in the transaction as well as similar communications mocking assets acquired in a previous deal were revealed during the hearing.\n\nBartholomew and Kovacic said the texts could undermine the divestiture deal’s appeal.\n\n“The only way the merger could survive antitrust scrutiny is if the divestiture actually creates real, meaningful competition. The testimony from the C&S executive about getting the worst chains is damning,” Bartholomew said.\n\n“It’s a recurring theme, not an impulsive observation,” Kovacic said, noting the executive has criticized multiple C&S Wholesale Grocer deals.\n\nWhat is a whipsaw strike? Union offers a vivid example\n\nUnion groups have decried the proposed merger, saying it would weaken their bargaining power. As the hearing began, Local 555 – which had previously supported the deal before pulling support during a breakdown in contract negotiations – used a technique union officials say the deal endangered: a whipsaw strike.\n\nFor a week, 4,500 workers walked off the job from 28 Fred Meyer stores (a Kroger subsidiary), picketed and urged shoppers to get their food from Albertsons or (subsidiary) Safeway. During the hearing, union officials testified that shoppers will go to another nearby store to support the strike. Whipsaw bargaining and whipsaw strikes allow workers to play rival retailers off of each other. But if Kroger owned Albertsons, the technique wouldn’t work.\n\nBartholomew thought the strike might help make the case of the danger to unions as well as providing a vivid example of two companies in a local market of union workers.\n\nA controversial concept advanced in the case by the FTC is that there are local union “markets” of workers that union grocers “compete” for that would be harmed by the merger. Kroger and Albertsons have dismissed the idea, asserting there is little difference in skills or pay between union and nonunion labor in the cities they operate.\n\n“It is evidence that supports the FTC's claims that the merger could harm employers,” Bartholomew said, adding that the strike also vividly displayed a local labor market.\n\nKovacic disagreed.\n\n“(The strike) can appear contrived – if it looks like posturing by the UFCW, it’s not going to affect the case,” Kovacic said.\n\nAlbertsons CEO hints at grim future\n\nOn the stand, Sankaran hinted Albertsons could face struggles in the coming years as nontraditional rivals continue to sell cheap food and the Boise, Idaho-based grocer fights to close its pricing disadvantage with Kroger, Walmart and others. He said layoffs, stores closures and market exits might have to be considered.\n\nBut FTC attorneys grilled Sankaran, asking him where all this concern was when he testified before Congress in 2022 and defended a massive $4 billion dividend paid out to investors as part of the deal. They also pointed to Sankaran’s $43 million golden parachute he will get if the deal is approved. Another embarrassing moment on the stand was Sankaran trying to explain why he and other executives didn’t know there was an auto-delete function on their mobile phones (that destroyed hundreds of texts) when they were under legal order to preserve communications as the company looked to sell itself.\n\nBartholomew wasn’t persuaded and Sankaran’s warnings call into question the nearly $1 billion both companies have plowed into trying get the deal approved.\n\n“To me, it sounds like fear-mongering,” Bartholomew said. “If I was a shareholder, I would have a lot of questions about the companies' spending decisions.”\n\nRoss was similarly unmoved by Sankaran’s warnings.\n\n“(That’s) probably not a good move by Albertson’s. Companies often make dire warning about what might happen … and when the merger is disallowed make miraculous recoveries from their supposed deathbeds,” Ross said.\n\nWho will win the ruling for or against the preliminary hearing (and why)?\n\nKovacic: The FTC wins. There’s too much disclosure on both the Kroger-Albertsons competition and the C&S Wholesale texts.\n\nBartholomew: Can’t predict, but the “FTC is making a good showing.”\n\nRoss: Too close to call. “This case sounds pretty evenly matched.”\n\nFor the latest on Kroger, P&G, Fifth Third Bank and Cincinnati business, follow @alexcoolidge on X (formerly Twitter).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/2024/05/22/anonymous-bashing-of-texas-quarterback-quinn-ewers-unwarranted/73762645007/", "title": "Anonymous coaches bashing Texas Longhorns QB Quinn Ewers is ..."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/business/unilever-shampoo-recall", "title": "Dove, Nexxus and other dry shampoos recalled for cancer-causing ...", "text": "1.
