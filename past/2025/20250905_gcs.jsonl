The state will almost certainly face a magnitude 6.7 or larger earthquake within the next three decades, the USGS concludes. Some of the most at-risk locations are San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia's continuous temblor risk coincides with a huge earthquake brewing along the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the coast of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area faces high chances of getting a Big One\n\nWith nearly four dozen faults in the region stretching from Napa to Monterey, the San Francisco Bay Area has a 72% chance of a major quake registering 6.7 magnitude or higher by 2043, USGS researchers previously estimated.\n\nThe findings also indicate that the Bay Area has a 51% chance of experiencing an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 and a 20% chance of measuring a magnitude of 7.5 or higher within that time frame.\n\n\"The earthquake threat is very real,\" said Richard Allen, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and the director of the Berkeley Seismology Lab. \"It is a real challenge as we have to take that long-term view, but also not to live our lives in fear.\"\n\nIn December, thousands in the Bay Area and across Northern California were worried after a magnitude 7 earthquake struck along a sparsely populated northern coast of California, triggering a tsunami warning across a swath of the West Coast stretching from southern Oregon to San Francisco.\n\nTraci Grant, 53, a public relations specialist who felt the quake in San Francisco, told USA TODAY at the time she felt her retrofitted apartment move in slow motion.\n\n\"It just kept going and going,\" Grant said. \"It was scary and a bit exciting at the same time. It was more of a roll than just shake, shake, shake.\"\n\nLess than two hours after the initial quake, some areas experienced 13 different aftershocks, ranging from 5.1 to 3.1, the USGS reported. Two hours after that, at least 39 aftershocks of at least a 2.5 magnitude occured in the region, authorities said. No earthquake-related injuries or major damages were reported.\n\nGoulet said if the quake had been directly on land, \"the impact would’ve been more devastating.\"\n\nGoulet said December's quake magnitude conjured up the Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906. It was a nearly minute-long 7.9 magnitude quake followed by a fire that burned for three days, destroying thousands of buildings.\n\nThe San Francisco quake killed an estimated 3,000 people and destroyed roughly 80% of the city. It is known as one of the deadliest in U.S. history. Allen also noted the 1868 Hayward Fault earthquake that struck the heart of the Bay Area and killed 30 people.\n\nWith all the Bay Area faults, Allen said his research shows there's a \"two-in-three chance\" the Big One could be soon.\n\n\"We're overdue for a recurrence,\" Allen said.\n\nThe last major earthquake in the Bay Area occurred more than a decade ago, when an earthquake rattled Napa Valley in 2014.\n\nThe 6.0 magnitude quake in Wine Country killed one person and injured 300 people. The incident caused more than $1 billion in damage across Napa and neighboring cities, including Vallejo, California, which took years to rebuild.\n\nThen there was the Loma Prieta earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989, killing 63 people and injuring nearly 3,800 others. The earthquake disrupted the World Series and damaged the Bay Bridge, Oakland’s Cypress Freeway, and swaths of San Francisco. It caused up to $10 billion in damage.\n\n\"There's this perception that large quakes are frequent, but actually, they are quite rare,\" Goulet said. \"We just don't know when they will happen.\"\n\nLos Angeles is ripe for a Big One as well\n\nThe Los Angeles area also stands a chance of getting a major earthquake, as there's a 60% chance of a 6.7 magnitude quake within the next 30 years, the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, there is also a 46% probability that a 7.0 magnitude earthquake will hit L.A. and a 31% chance a 7.5 magnitude quake will strike during that same period.\n\nAllen, the Berkeley seismologist, said Southern California has just as high an earthquake risk compared to its Northern California counterparts. \"They face a similar threat, if not higher,\" Allen said.\n\nGoulet added that with Los Angeles and the surrounding areas being so populous (nearly 18.6 million residents according to California Finance Department statistics), there is a high probability for major destruction. She cites the disastrous 6.7 earthquake in Northridge, California, in 1994, which killed 60 people and injured more than 7,000.\n\nThe devastation also left thousands of buildings and structures collapsed or damaged across Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Bernardino counties. Thousands of residents became homeless as the aftermath caused between $13 billion to $20 billion in damages.\n\n\"The closer an earthquake is to a large population, the greater the impact will be,\" Goulet said.\n\nGoulet also points to a sequence of earthquakes in 2019 in Ridgecrest, California. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake rattled the city two days after an initial 6.4 magnitude quake. Goulet was among a USGS on-site team researching the first quake when, surprisingly, the second temblor struck.\n\n\"It was terrifying,\" Goulet said. \"We were there taking measurements and just as we were finishing our work and planning for the next day, the second one occurred about six miles away from us.

Avoid doorways and do not run outside.\n\nTo protect yourself during an earthquake, drop down to your hands and knees and hold onto something sturdy. Cover your head and neck with your arms and crawl underneath a sturdy table or desk to shelter. If that’s not available to you, then crawl next to an interior wall to get away from windows. If you are under a table or desk, hold onto it with one hand so that if it moves, you can move with it.\n\nMore: How to prepare for 'the big one' in Coachella Valley\n\nWhat if I’m driving during an earthquake?\n\nSlow down and pull over as soon as it’s safe, according to the California Highway Patrol. Remain in the vehicle with your seat belt fastened, engine off, and parking brake set. Once the shaking stops, check your vehicle for damage and its occupants for injuries. Only begin driving when it is safe to do so. Once you can start moving again, do so slowly and cautiously, avoiding any areas of the road that appear to be damaged or obstructed, and continue to avoid bridges and ramps.\n\nWhat have been the biggest earthquakes in recorded California history?\n\n​​California's largest recorded earthquakes since 1800, ranked by magnitude, according to the California Department of Conservation.\n\n7.9 : Jan. 9, 1857 in Fort Tejon Two killed; created 220-mile surface scar\n\n: Jan. 9, 1857 in Fort Tejon Two killed; created 220-mile surface scar 7.8 : April 18, 1906 in San Francisco Possibly 3,000 killed; 225,000 displaced\n\n: April 18, 1906 in San Francisco Possibly 3,000 killed; 225,000 displaced 7.4 : March 26, 1872 in Owens Valley. 27 kille​d; three aftershocks of magnitude >6\n\n: March 26, 1872 in Owens Valley. 27 kille​d; three aftershocks of magnitude >6 7.4 : Nov. 8, 1980 just west of Eureka Injured 6; $2 million in damage\n\n: Nov. 8, 1980 just west of Eureka Injured 6; $2 million in damage 7.3 : July 21, 1952 in Kern County 12 killed; included three magnitude 6-plus aftershocks in five days\n\n: July 21, 1952 in Kern County 12 killed; included three magnitude 6-plus aftershocks in five days 7.3 : June 28, 1992 in Landers.

Study highlights a West Coast risk.", "text": "The pressure keeps building below the Earth’s surface off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and a multi-layered disaster could strike at any time.\n\nA huge earthquake is brewing along the Cascadia Subduction Zone that could destroy bridges, reshape the landscape and trigger a massive tsunami. Scientists have known about the looming danger for years, but ongoing research keeps painting a clearer picture of what could happen.\n\nAmong the dangers: A huge tsunami that will wash over coastal areas and permanently flood them.\n\nThe quake is a matter of when, not if, said Tina Dura, a geologist and professor of natural hazards at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia.\n\n\"Geologically speaking, we’re well within the window of possibility,\" she said.\n\nDura was the lead author on a new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on how climate change is increasing the potential impact of such an earthquake on coastal areas that may suddenly sink.\n\nResearchers expect the quake will trigger an as much a 6-foot drop in some inland areas — then a massive tsunami will flood those regions, some permanently.\n\n\"Imagine if, after Hurricane Katrina, after all the horrible things that happened, if we'd also lost big chunks of New Orleans and it never came back,\" said Diego Melgar, a professor at the University of Oregon and director of the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center.\n\nThe loss of swaths of land is just one of the surreal series of events that will occur when the earthquake eventually strikes, researchers say.\n\nWhen will the next big Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake strike?\n\nThis is a mix of bad and good news. The quake is a certainty, but could be hundreds of years off.\n\nWhile it could happen at any time, seismologists have estimated there is a 15% probability of a magnitude 8 in the next 50 years — a substantial risk for such a devastating scenario.\n\n\"We can’t predict exactly when the next great Cascadia earthquake will occur. It could be tomorrow or decades from now,\" said Dura.\n\nPart of their confidence comes from the history of huge earthquakes in the region.\n\n\"The last event was in 1700, and paleoseismic records show these earthquakes recur roughly every 200 to 800 years. By 2100, there is a 30% chance of a large earthquake happening,\" Dura said.\n\nThe Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake\n\nScientists have a clear picture of what will happen when the earthquake strikes.\n\n“First would come extremely strong shaking – shaking that makes it difficult to stand or walk. This would probably last a minute or longer,\" said Melgar.\n\nNext, land along the coast would drop as much as six-and-a-half feet in places, probably within minutes.\n\n\"Then there would probably be 30 to 40 minutes of seeming peace. But that's a false impression, because the tsunami is coming,\" he said.\n\nThe resulting waves would be on the order of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed nearly 230,000 people.\n\nThe tsunami wave from an earthquake of this size could get to 90 or 100 feet tall, Melgar said.\n\nTsunami trouble\n\nWhen the tsunami wave arrives at the shore \"you get this massive surge that lasts for hours, sometimes days,\" Melgar said.\n\nThis is where global warming comes in. Two things play a part in creating the catastrophe their research describes.\n\nFirst, the land would have dropped as much as six feet. At the same time, sea level rise from climate change means that the water which rushes in will cover more land.\n\n\"You'd hope the tsunami could come to shore, then flow out again and the land would dry out. But there will be parts where it's now below sea level – the water won't flow back,\" said Melgar.\n\nA great Cascadia earthquake could instantly expand flood zones and double flood exposure for residents, structures, and roads. When combined with rising sea levels, these effects could render some coastal communities permanently uninhabitable, said Dura.\n\nEven if some areas along the coastline do dry out, they will be much closer to sea level and become susceptible to nuisance flooding if there's a particularly big storm or high tide.\n\nLittle earthquakes won't prevent a big one\n\nThe West Coast is subject to numerous small earthquakes all the time, but they're not big enough to relieve the pressure that's being built up along the Cascadia fault line, Melgar said.\n\nSo much energy has built up in the zone that even a magnitude 8 earthquake wouldn't relieve it.\n\n\"Remember, the magnitude scale is logarithmic. So each increase in magnitude is an increase of 30 in terms of energy,\" he said.\n\nThe great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was a magnitude 8 temblor and it was devastating. \"If we had one magnitude 8 quake here, we'd still have 29 to go to relieve the pressure,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/15/how-common-are-east-coast-earthquakes/77715824007/", "title": "A small quake just shook Virginia. How rare are East Coast ...", "text": "A small earthquake that startled residents near Richmond, Virginia, this week is a reminder that the East Coast is not exempt from the dangers of temblors.\n\nThe 2.8 quake hit about 6 miles northwest of Glen Allen, Virginia, and about 13 miles northwest of the state's capital on Tuesday just before 5:30 p.m. EST, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Residents in Richmond and Henrico County felt the shaking, according to local outlet WTVR. No damage or injuries were reported.\n\nIn 2011, an earthquake near Mineral, Virginia, about 50 miles from Richmond, became the most widely felt earthquake in U.S. history, the USGS said. The Aug. 23 quake caused more than $200 million in damage, including to the Washington Monument and National Cathedral in the nation's capital.\n\nAt a magnitude of 5.8, it wasn't among the strongest earthquakes to hit in the country, but the unique geographical makeup of the East Coast meant it was felt much farther and wider than the more common West Coast quakes.\n\nAre East Coast earthquakes rare?\n\nEarthquakes are much less frequent in the eastern part of the country than in the west, but they have been documented in every state east of the Mississippi River, according to the U.S. Nearly all eastern states have seen large enough quakes to cause damage at one time or another.\n\nAnnually, seismologists clock about 900,000 earthquakes worldwide, but the vast majority happen along plate boundaries not found in the eastern and midwestern U.S., according to Michigan Technological University's Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences.\n\nEvery so often, small to moderate quakes surprise the East Coast in states such as New York and New Jersey.\n\nStrong quakes have hit in the East before, and documentation even from temblors hundreds of years ago allow us to estimate their magnitude. In November 1775, a 6.0 quake 50 miles outside of Boston caused serious damage in the city. An 1886 earthquake in Charleston, South Carolina, that was 6.8 to 7.2 in magnitude damaged or destroyed much of the city.\n\nThe 2011 Virginia earthquake triggered landslides 150 miles away and sent damaging tremors four times farther and over an area 20 times larger than ever recorded before, the USGS said in a report the next year.\n\nWhy quakes are felt differently in the East\n\nThough they're usually not as high in magnitude as quakes in states such as California, earthquakes in the East can actually be more concerning because they can affect a larger area than earthquakes of the same magnitudes in the West, according to the USGS.\n\nThat's because rocks in the eastern part of the country are much older, in some cases by millions of years. Older rocks have been exposed to more extreme temperatures and pressure, and faults have had more time to heal, making them harder and denser, so seismic waves travel across them more efficiently. In the West, faults are newer and absorb more of the seismic wave energy is absorbed and doesn't spread as far.\n\nThe 2011 Virginia quake was felt by millions of people.

At least 172 people were treated for injuries at a hospital, and three were in critical condition. The quake, which is likely to produce dozens of aftershocks, could result in losses that top $100 million.\n\nCLEANUP TIME\n\nWine and olive oil bottlers suffered damage. Hundreds of broken bottles littered the floor of Lucero Olive Oil, but owner David Gadlin said the store would reopen Monday as usual.\n\n\"A lot of downtown business owners will be back up and running,\" he said. \"There's been financial hardship, but we'll get through it. Few people were hurt. That's what's important.\"\n\nAbout 15 buildings were damaged too severely to allow people inside, and many more awaited further evaluation. Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said 90 to 100 homes and buildings were deemed not habitable.\n\nCity and country fire crews worked overtime to restore services to residents. Schools were ordered closed Monday.\n\nBertha Flores, 40, was out buying ice to keep the food in her refrigerator cold as her family waited for the power to come back on.\n\nSpeaking in Spanish, she said the earthquake frightened her children, but everyone was OK except for some cuts from shattered glass.\n\n\"I'm a cleaner. I think there is going to be a lot of work for my company in the next couple of days,'' she said.\n\nThe quake — which occurred at a depth of less than 7 miles — was felt as far north as Sacramento and as far south as Santa Cruz and was immediately followed by a series of small aftershocks.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, nearly 9 million people were exposed to varying levels of ground shaking.\n\nIn Napa, most of the damage was restricted to the older central downtown area.\n\n\"We're getting cancels from businesses that planned to do some work in the city,\" says Bret Cudd, co-partner of the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines in Napa. Though 20 rooms were vacated early by customers — who were given refunds — the rooms were quickly snatched up by the city and a Los Angeles TV station.\n\n\"We had some lights knocked over, but the water and electricity are fine,\" Cudd said. \"Downtown took the damage.\"\n\nSTATE OF EMERGENCY\n\nGov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency because of damage in the Napa area.\n\nMike Parness, city manager, said 15 or 16 buildings in central downtown were \"red tagged\" after inspectors found damage left them too dangerous for people to enter.\n\n\"We've got a lot of workers out checking out homes and buildings,'' Parness said.\n\nA 10-foot chunk of brick and concrete was shaken from the corner of the old County Courthouse building. Big pieces of rubble littered the lawn and street in front of the building.\n\nThe quake was centered near American Canyon about 6 miles southwest of Napa, the USGS reported. It's the largest quake to hit the Napa Valley region near San Francisco since the Loma Prieta temblor in 1989.\n\nAt least three people were in critical condition from quake injuries. One of them, a child injured by a falling fireplace, was airlifted to the University of California-Davis hospital for surgery.\n\nThere were about 60 water main leaks.\n\nCELLPHONE NETWORKS BUCKLE\n\nAfter the initial shock wore off, an almost festive air prevailed in the city as tourists on rented bicycles rode through closed streets. So many people were sending photos from their mobile phones that cellular systems were overwhelmed.\n\nAt the Ranch Market, a grocery store in Napa, owner Beth Housley says she and her husband, Arik, are determined to reopen Monday.\n\n\"We had employees and family friends come and help clean up,'' she said. \"It should be safe for customers.''\n\nNewer homes and buildings away from the center of the city suffered less damage, but many were without power.\n\nThat lack of power meant some residents who rely on well water were unable to get water.\n\nJohn Furtado headed into Napa to look for water. \"But we're doing fine overall. It's just some minor damage. A couple bottles of wine broke,'' he said.\n\nKelly Huston, a deputy director with the California Office of Emergency Services, said there were no reports of fatalities, but dozens were taken to hospitals.\n\nThe CEO for Napa's Queen of the Valley Medical Center said the area's main hospital had treated 172 individuals since the earthquake hit. He couldn't determine whether all the injuries were earthquake-related, though typically, the emergency room handles about 85 a day. Thirteen patients were admitted and one was in critical condition, CEO Walt Mickens said. Most were treated for cuts and bruises, though some were treated for medical conditions that may have been worsened by the day's anxiety, he said.\n\n\"Now it appears we're treating people (injured while) cleaning up,\" hospital spokeswoman Vanessa deGier said Sunday afternoon.\n\nMOBILE HOME FIRE\n\nSix structure fires were reported, including one that destroyed four mobile homes, Napa Fire Chief John Callanan said.\n\nAt least 64,000 people lost power. In Napa, 20,786 homes and businesses lost power, according to Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest power provider in the area. Other hard hit areas include Saint Helena, where nearly 4,300 customers were without power; Santa Rosa, where 4,500 customers lost power; and Sonoma, where 3,900 customers lost power. By evening, the utility said service had been restored to all but about 7,000 customers.\n\nNapa Police Capt. Steve Potter said the area's 911 system was briefly overwhelmed by calls that came in shortly after the quake, but the system quickly came back.\n\nThere were no reported highway blockages, though Huston said there was a report of a buckled offramp on state Highway 72 at Sonoma.\n\nNapa is known for its lush vineyards, robust wines and rolling hills.\n\nThe historic Napa Valley Courthouse lost a portion of its roof, and police blocked off sections of the downtown to keep crowds away from the debris. Two other historical buildings — the Sam Kee Laundry and the Goodman Library — were damaged.\n\nDouglas Edwards, 27, a Napa resident, said the earthquake woke him up from a sound sleep.\n\n\"It was shaking so hard I was barely able to get myself and my daughter out,\" he said. \"When I stood up, the floor moved so much, I fell back down again. I ran outside, and you could see the transformers exploding in the sky. It was just flash, flash, flash.\"\n\nNapa County Supervisor Bill Dodd inspected damage at the Napa County administration building Sunday morning.\n\n\"It's devastated in there,\" he said. Ceilings collapsed, furniture was scattered and file cabinets were upturned on the floor.\n\nDodd said the historic three-story Winship building, which lost a corner of its roof, looks to be a total loss. He said it had been completely renovated 10 years ago, and the renovation included a seismic upgrade, which is supposed to make buildings able to withstand an earthquake.\n\nIt remains too early to provide a specific economic or insured loss estimate, according to Aon Benfield, a reinsurance firm. The USGS's automated economic loss software predicted that there was a 27% chance that economic losses would end up beyond $1 billion and a 35% chance that economic losses would top $100 million.\n\nThe USGS said the quake is likely to produce 30 to 70 small aftershocks of magnitude 3 to 5 within the next week. The probability of a strong and possibly damaging aftershock with a magnitude of 5 or greater in the next week is 54%, the USGS said.\n\nThe quake is the strongest temblor to hit the USA outside Alaska this year, according to the USGS. About five quakes of this magnitude or stronger hit the USA each year, many in or near Alaska.\n\nContributing: Donna Leinwand Leger in Washington; William M.

Thompson told family members that she was asleep in a reclining chair in her living room when a TV struck her in the head during the earthquake, Capt. Steven Blower said Wednesday.\n\nThompson did not go to the hospital until the next day when she told her family that she felt dizzy and experienced a decline in mental function, Blower said. She collapsed and was rushed to a hospital, where she died Friday due to bleeding in her skull, sheriff's officials said.\n\n\"Her condition continued to deteriorate over time and, unfortunately, she passed away,\" Sheriff's Capt.

The worst damage and disruption was confined to downtown Napa, where a post office, library and a 141-room hotel were among 150 homes and buildings deemed unsafe to occupy.\n\nThe county's famed wineries also suffered damage, with oak wine barrels weighing more than a quarter-ton and stacked high cascading down.\n\nA survey commissioned by the Napa Valley Vintners Association and Napa County and presented to the county on Tuesday estimated that 60 percent of Napa wineries suffered some damage, with as much as 25 percent suffering moderate to severe damage exceeding $50,000 per winery. The most devastated winery suffered $8 million in damage, according to the survey by Silicon Valley Bank's Wine Division.

Business owners were determined to clean up and leave the earthquake in the past.\n\nNapa County Supervisor Bill Dodd spent Monday morning helping clean out a water distribution warehouse he owns in American Canyon, near the epicenter of the 6.0-magnitude quake that struck at 3:20 a;m. Sunday. \"We had water gushing out the door yesterday,\" he said. On Monday, he said, it's all about cleaning up and moving on. \"We'll get through this,\" he said.\n\nOFF LIMIT BUILDINGS\n\nAs the city's inspection of properties widened, more buildings and residences were deemed uninhabitable. Forty-nine city properties were red-tagged, officials said. More than 100 had yellow tags, meaning owners could enter but only in a limited way.\n\nSome streets in Napa, a town of 77,000, remained snarled by rubble from the strongest quake to shake the San Francisco Bay area since the magnitude-6.9 Loma Prieta quake struck in 1989, collapsing part of the Bay Bridge roadway and killing more than 60 people, most when an Oakland freeway fell. A magnitude 6.9 quake is at least 20 times as powerful as one measuring 6.0, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe Napa earthquake sent at least 172 people to a hospital for treatment. On Monday, one was still in critical condition.\n\nAFTERSHOCKS\n\nResidents were already feeling aftershocks that usually follow big temblors.\n\nState geologist John Parrish said the aftershocks will decrease in magnitude and that it is unlikely there will be a large follow-up earthquake. Still, he warned people to be careful because newly damaged buildings are now more susceptible to collapse from aftershocks.\n\nIn Napa neighborhoods Monday morning, construction company trucks were everywhere. The sounds of drills and plywood being cut were constant.\n\nStill, there was little obvious damage outside of older brick buildings in the central part of town. In homes, the problems were mostly in older chimneys and some wooden structures.\n\n600 HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT WATER\n\nPacific Gas & Electric crews were rapidly restoring power. City officials said they expected all power to be back by the afternoon. On Sunday, as many as 70,000 residents had lost power.\n\nSome of those who lost water, however, were looking at a longer wait. About 600 households were without water, and it may take until Wednesday or Thursday for all residents to get their service back, city officials said.\n\nThe Napa Unified School District closed for students, but teachers and staff were checking on the district's more than two dozen schools. School has been in session since Aug. 13. For parents without other child-care options, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Napa Valley are providing free care and activities for students as long as schools remain closed.\n\nSigns of the earthquake were mostly small yet clear. On Napa-Vallejo Highway, one of the main routes into Napa from San Francisco, a deep crack crosses the roadway and is marked by orange safety cones. It has been filled in with asphalt, but still jolts vehicles as they cross it.\n\nHOMEOWNER DAMAGE\n\nWhile the damage to the area is not devastating, many homeowners face tens of thousands of dollars or much more in repairs, rebuilding brick chimneys, righting tilted garages and fixing cracked sidewalks and walls.\n\nOthers face even more substantial work.\n\n\"This is the worst wooden building I've seen,\" Raymond Woods of Woodsmyth Construction said of an Edwardian home that had fallen off its stone foundation on Fourth Street in Napa. He had come into town to volunteer for clean up.\n\nThe building's porch hung askew off the stairs. To the side, the entire house had slid a foot off its foundation, leaving a tangle of gas lines, which were marked with yellow tape.\n\nIn an alley alongside the house, the devastation was even starker. The back porches and stairs had come off and the window frames were popped out. A crack ran down the center of the building. \"It's a total loss,\" Woods said.\n\nYet two houses away, \"we didn't even lose any glasses,\" said Jorge Garcia. He lives in a newer home built under stricter building codes.\n\n\"We have a 60-gallon fish tank and nothing happened to it,\" he said.\n\nWINE INDUSTRY DAMAGES\n\nThe quake, which hit the wine-making industry on the eve of its harvest, could result in more than $100 million in losses, authorities estimated. Napa is home to nearly 800 wineries, which produced 49.7 million cases of wine in 2012, according to the Napa Valley Vintners, a trade group.\n\nGuests in the five-story Andaz Napa hotel, one of the tallest buildings in the city, were immediately evacuated after the quake hit, many remaining on the sidewalk with their luggage even hours later, wondering about alternative accommodations, the Napa Valley Registerreports. One guest, Cheryllyn Tallman, told the newspaper she was so shaken she planned to cut short her wine country vacation and head back home to the East Coast.\n\n\"I live in Upstate New York,\" Tallman said. \"We just have blizzards — and they tell you when they are coming.\"\n\nGov.

A simple, yet often used analogy is that if you’re sitting in a valley or basin, it acts like a bowl of gelatin and it will shake more than surrounding rock.\n\nBut not all earthquakes are created equal and the ground you walk on can make all the difference.\n\n“The local geology definitely matters — what you’re sitting on,” said Dr. Susan Hough, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey. “What the topography is, it definitely matters.”\n\nThis animation, called a Ground Motion Visualization (GMV), shows the motion of the ground as detected on seismometers across North America - each dot is a seismic station and when the ground moves up it turns red and when it moves down it turns blue. pic.twitter.com/KcLV8g2XfY — EarthScope Consortium (@EarthScope_sci) April 28, 2021\n\nEarthquakes are broken down into two basic wave types: body waves (often called P-waves or S-waves which travel through the Earth) and surface waves (which travel along the Earth’s surface).\n\nThe surface of the Earth is made up of a variety of soil types - from sand to clay to rock and many others, so the damage resulting from those basic wave types can vary as an earthquake travels through these varying types of terrain.\n\nHough explains further that while the waves themselves travel the same way, in the sense that a P wave is still a P wave, and a S wave is still a S wave, however, their speeds and amplitudes will change depending on the rock type.\n\nWhether it is sedimental rock or a young sandy soil, it makes a difference.\n\nBecause the particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, surface waves tend to cause more damage.\n\nEarthquakes occur on every continent in the world — from the highest peaks in the Himalayan Mountains to the lowest valleys like the Dead Sea to the bitter cold regions in Antarctica. However, the distribution of these quakes is not random.\n\nEver wonder what #EarthquakeHazard looks like for the entire US? The @USGS’s National Seismic Hazard Map (NSHM) defines the potential for earthquake ground shaking for various probability levels across the country. pic.twitter.com/aojeW5mIYy — USGS Earthquakes (@USGS_Quakes) September 21, 2020\n\nSize matters, and so does the type of terrain\n\nWhen it comes to earthquakes, the size is very important. The physical size of an earthquake is measured in magnitude. For example, a 5.5 is a moderate earthquake, and a 6.5 is a strong earthquake. Because the scale is logarithmically based, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold increase. So, a 6.5 magnitude quake is 10 times bigger than a 5.5 magnitude, not one times bigger like the number implies.\n\nBut just because the magnitude of an earthquake is bigger does not always mean the resulting damage is worse.\n\nFor example, in January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 quake struck Haiti. More than 200,000 people lost their lives during that event with estimated damages between $7.8 and $8.5 billion.\n\nIn 2019 a 7.1 magnitude quake struck near Ridgecrest, California. For this stronger quake only one person lost their life, with an estimated $5 billion in damages.\n\nBesides the magnitude being similar, the depths were also similar. The Haiti quake was 8 miles (13 km) deep, and the California quake was 5 miles (8 km) deep. While 8 miles may not sound shallow, it is in terms of earthquakes. Geologically speaking, any earthquake that is less than 43 miles (70 km) deep is considered shallow. The shallower an earthquake is, the more likely damage will occur since it is closer to the surface.\n\nSo why was there such a disparity between the fatalities and damages from two quakes with such similar magnitudes and depths? The answer has a lot to do with plate tectonics and how buildings are constructed.\n\nEarthquakes emit low and high frequencies. If the ground vibrates slowly, it is low frequency. If the ground vibrates quickly, it’s more of a high frequency.\n\nLow frequencies mainly affect multistory buildings in particular. In fact, the lower the frequency, the bigger the buildings that will be affected. Whereas high frequencies tend to affect small buildings.\n\nFrequency was just one factor in why the Haiti earthquake was so devastating.\n\n“The earthquake itself, like most large earthquakes, released energy with a wide range of frequencies,” Hough tells CNN. “The bigger the earthquake, the greater the level of booming low tones. But big earthquakes also release a lot of high-frequency energy. The high-frequency energy gets damped out quickly as it travels through the earth, so the Haiti earthquake was damaging to Port-au-Prince in part because the fault rupture was so close.”\n\nSubsoil is often just as important as magnitude and frequency.\n\nIn Haiti and other island nations, you have rocks that rise from the surface, on which houses are built, to much softer zones which can actually amplify the seismic waves.\n\nThese factors can locally intensify the seismic waves, therefore leading to additional damage.\n\n“In the 1906 California earthquake, some people living 100 miles away slept through the quake,” Hough said. “Whereas the New Madrid earthquakes (which happened in 1811 and 1812 in present-day Missouri), it actually rang church bells in Charleston, South Carolina. That has to do with how the waves travel through the crust. There’s a difference.”\n\nCalifornia’s terrain varies widely. There are active faults, mountain ranges, valleys, basins and beaches. When an earthquake occurs in California, the energy is scattered around and gets attenuated by the varying terrain, which means it just doesn’t make it very far out into the crust.\n\nIn contrast, the East Coast has an older crust. When an earthquake happens, it reverberates like the waves produced by a ripple in water. The waves can travel for hundreds of miles, usually much farther in the East than in California.\n\nHouses in a poor neighborhood of Port-au-Prince lie in ruins a day after an earthquake struck the Haitian capital on January 12, 2010. Handout/Getty Images South America/Getty Images\n\n“There’s three important factors with earthquakes, there’s energy that leaves the source, there’s amplification by the local geology when it gets to a site, and then there’s what happens in between,” Hough said. “It’s the in between that really matters for East Coast versus West Coast.”\n\nHaiti also has a topographical aspect to it. Port-au-Prince sits mostly at sea level, with sandy sediments in those low-lying areas. But just 10-15 miles away, the elevation increases several thousand feet into a more mountainous terrain with harder rock at the surface.\n\nShaking is amplified by low-lying sandy sediments in Port-au-Prince, but also on some of Haiti’s hills and ridges due to a topographic effect.\n\nBut we must also build structures according to the soil and/or rock that we are building on.\n\nConstructing on harder ground provides more stability for the buildings because essentially the rock absorbs the waves. Hough cited the 2015 magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal and leveled multistory buildings in the capital of Kathmandu.\n\n“In Kathmandu in 2015, there was a booming amplification because it’s a lake bed zone, but the valley was sloshing back and forth with a five-second period, and you can see that on closed captioned TV. You had things that went to one side … one one thousand, two one thousand, and then back three one thousand, four one thousand. It’s a fairly slow motion, and it was strong due to the lake bed. But the effect on buildings depends on the size of the buildings.”\n\nHough uses an analogy of a big swell in the ocean explaining that waves will be damaging if they jostle the boat violently. For a large ship on a big swell its bow would go up while the stern goes down, generating stress within the boat. If the ship is smaller than the swell, the entire ship just goes up and down – essentially going along for the ride.\n\nWhen the ground becomes a liquid\n\nAnother significant contributor to earthquake damage comes from earthquake-triggered landslides and liquefaction, collectively known as ground failure.\n\nThe USGS has a ground failure product that provides near-real time regional estimates of landslide and liquefaction hazards triggered by earthquakes.\n\n“It takes time for first responders and experts to survey the actual damage in the area, so our product provides early estimates of where to focus attention and response planning,” according to the USGS.\n\nThough the models provide initial awareness, overall extent, and indicate areas in which they are most likely to have occurred, they do not predict very specific occurrences.\n\nGround failure estimates from a 6.0 magnitude quake in India in 2021 USGS\n\nUsing satellite imagery, the USGS was able to map more than 23,000 landslides that were triggered by the strong shaking across the island of Hispaniola from the 2010 Haiti quake.\n\nBut landslides are just one component of ground failure.\n\nLiquefaction is a process where water-saturated sediments are shaken hard enough to start behaving more like a liquid rather than a solid.\n\n“There is something called non-linearity, and it turns out that if you try to shake soft sediments really hard, it’s not a bowl of Jell-O as much as it is a sandbox,” Hough says.\n\nFor example, Hough explains that if you shake a sandbox really hard, it’s going to stop acting like rock. Things are going to shift around at grain-size level and that process absorbs energy.\n\nA tweet surfaced during a 6.0 magnitude quake that struck India in 2021 showing how liquefaction occurred.\n\n“If the sand is water-saturated, as I imagine it is in many places in India, it can start to behave like a liquid. Liquefaction has a couple of consequences for shaking: some of the potentially damaging shaking gets absorbed, which can be a good thing, but if the ground beneath a structure starts behaving like a liquid, the structure no longer has a solid foundation. It’s like it’s sitting on quicksand. Even a well-built building can just tip over,” Hough told CNN.\n\nAny aftershocks will further the damage since buildings could be already structurally compromised from the initial quake. Building on a slope, or especially soft ground, can lead to the sinking of the foundations and allow the waves to multiply the devastating impact of the earthquake.\n\nIt’s also important to note that what works in one disaster does not work in another.\n\nIt is often mentioned that buildings in Haiti are not built to the same standards that buildings are in California, New Zealand or Chile where earthquakes are also common. While this is true, it only tells part of the story.\n\nHaiti is more likely to be hit by a major hurricane in any given year than they are by a major earthquake.\n\nHough explains that they have a building style where they put very heavy roofs on for hurricanes, so the roof doesn’t blow off. But when an earthquake happens, the very heavy concrete roof gets displaced and compromises the underlying structure, which likely already had some element of building vulnerability to begin with.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/china/china-earthquake-sichuan-intl-hnk", "title": "China earthquake: Death toll rises to 65 in Sichuan as aftershocks ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least 65 people are confirmed dead after an earthquake hit China’s southwestern Sichuan province on Monday, according to Chinese broadcaster CCTV.\n\nAftershocks were still being felt on Tuesday, state media said, a day after the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said a 6.6-magnitude quake shook the region southwest of Sichuan’s capital Chengdu around 1 p.m. Monday.\n\nSo far 248 injuries have been reported and at least 12 people remain missing, according to state media.\n\nImages showed rescue workers carrying injured residents over makeshift bridges in Luding County, near the quake’s epicenter.\n\nRescuers transfer injured people in Luding county, Ganzi prefecture, Sichuan Province, China, Sept 5, 2022.

The magnitude-7.8 quake, which shook a wide swath of northern India, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan, also triggered avalanches in the Himalayas, killing at least 10 people on Mount Everest.\n\nNepal police said at least 1,865 people were killed. Given the scale of the destruction, the death toll was expected to rise. An emergency Cabinet meeting designated 29 districts as crisis zones, the Home Affairs Ministry said.\n\nTens of thousands of people, fearful of aftershocks bringing down more buildings, gathered outside during the night.\n\n\"My entire neighborhood is still in shock,\" said Chiranjibi Gurung in Katmandu. \"My children who were inside the houses at the time of the earthquake are scared to go inside now even at this time of the night.\"\n\nAround 180 bodies were pulled from the ruins of the nine-story Dharhara Tower in the center of the capital, China's official Xinhua News Agency reports. It said about 200 were feared trapped in the rubble of the tower in the city's historic Basantapur Durbar Square.\n\n\"We had heard the earthquake stories from our ancestors and how I remember my grandparents telling me about the devastation of the 1934 earthquake and how it uprooted the Dharahara Tower then,\" said Sabita Lal of Katmandu. \"I saw the same thing happen today to the tower. It was a massive one.\"\n\nAnother Katmandu resident, Deepen Bista, whose house was damaged, said the big jolt \"was longer than we had experienced before, it lasted a little more than a minute.\" The downtown area of the capital — with old houses and narrow lanes — was hardest hit, he said.\n\nCity hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. Dozens were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas. A woman with a bandage on her head sat in a set of chairs pulled from the hospital waiting room. Doctors and nurses had hooked up some patients to IV drips in the parking lot, or were giving people oxygen.\n\nThe quake struck before noon local time about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu in an area that the U.S. Geological Survey calls one of the most seismically hazardous regions on Earth. It is at the spot where the India plate collides with the Eurasia plate in a process that created the towering Himalayas.\n\nThe quake, which was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, was followed by about 15 aftershocks, including one registered at a magnitude of 6.6. At least 34 were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died on the Nepal-China border.\n\nFinance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said on Twitter that the quake had destroyed about 90% of about 1,000 homes and huts in the Laprak and Barpak villages near the epicenter.\n\nThe humanitarian aid group Oxfam said it was sending a team of technical experts from Britain to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food supplies. \"Communication is currently very difficult,\" said Cecilia Keizer, Oxfam country director in Nepal. \"Telephone lines are down, and the electricity has been cut off, making charging mobile phones difficult. The water is also cut off.\"\n\nKeizer said the quake had destroyed many of Katmandu's old houses and that at least one large apartment block had collapsed. \"People are gathered in the thousands in open spaces and are scared, as there have been several aftershocks,\" she said.\n\nIn Winchester, Va., Kriti Hada, a 20-year-old nursing student from Nepal who is attending Shenandoah University, said her sister in Nepal managed to get through by phone.\n\nAlthough she, her mother and another sister were unhurt, they were frightened by the intensity and duration of the aftershocks, which are continuing, Hada told USA TODAY.\n\nHada said her relatives, like hundreds of others who survived the initial quake, were remaining outside until the seismic activity ceases. \"We have very limited open spaces and they are surrounded by tall buildings that are also fragile,\" Hada said.\n\nNumerous countries around the world pledged immediate aid and supplies. The U.S. Mission in Nepal released an initial $1 million for immediate assistance. The embassy also said a U.S. search-and-rescue team is preparing to fly to Nepal. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development was sending a disaster assistance response team. India, Pakistan, China, France and Britain also said they would assist in the relief effort.\n\nWithin hours, an Indian Air Force C-130 landed at at Katmandu's airport with 39 disaster relief workers and 3.5 metric tons of supplies, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.\n\nSeveral buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers. Among them was the Dharahara Tower, one of Katmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath. The Katmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.\n\nDhany Osman, an editor with The Straits Times of Singapore said he was at Katmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport when the quake struck.\n\n\"As bits of the ceiling began to fall, passengers who were waiting for their flights began to panic and started running out of the terminal, with some tripping over each other,\" he wrote. \"Despite the nearest exit door being just 10 (yards) away, a group of Nepali men smashed open a glass panel and climbed out of it. I tried telling people around me to calm down but they kept shoving each other to get out.\"\n\nAlthough the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain-climbing.\n\nA Swedish woman, Jenny Adhikari, who lives in Nepal, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that she was riding a bus in the town of Melamchi when the earth began to move.\n\n\"A huge stone crashed only about 20 (yards) from the bus,\" she was quoted as saying. \"All the houses around me have tumbled down. I think there are lot of people who have died,\" she told the newspaper by telephone. Melamchi is about 30 miles northeast of Kathmandu.\n\nAlthough located on a major plate boundary with a history of large- to great-sized earthquakes, large earthquakes in this area are rare in the documented historical era, the USGS reports. Over the past century, just four events of magnitude 6.0 or larger have occurred within about 150 miles of Saturday's earthquake.\n\nAn earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. This means Saturday's earthquake — the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 — was 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.\n\nContributing: Naila Inayat in Lahore, Pakistan; Doyle Rice, McLean, Va.; Donna Leinwand Leger in Washington, D.C.; the Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/25"}]}

We’ve worked very cooperatively with Colombia for years on training and military operations and different basically sensitive operations.”\n\n“From my standpoint, it's a very significant event, but it's also very consistent with what President Trump has been wanting,” Maltz told USA TODAY. “I've been saying for many years that a law enforcement solution is not good enough to address these global terrorists operating in the Western Hemisphere. And this is no different than if it was Al Qaeda, ISIS or Hezbollah moving a boatload of chemical weapons.”\n\nA White House official said they could not comment on what kind of intelligence or evidence was used to determine that those killed in the military strike were Tren de Aragua members. \"These individuals were TdA narcoterrorists,\" the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment by name. \"We do not comment on matters of intelligence to the media.\"\n\nKenneth Roth, a Princeton School of Public and International Affairs professor and former Human Rights Watch executive director, criticized the strike.\n\n\"Drug trafficking is a crime, not an act of war,\" Roth said on X. \"Traffickers must be arrested, not summarily executed, which U.S. forces just illegally did.\"\n\nThe Trump administration designated Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and other drug gangs as well as Venezuelan criminal group Tren de Aragua as global terrorist organizations in February, as Trump stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and other administration officials said that meant the administration could now use the military to go after cartels, including with lethal force.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Joseph Garrison, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/03/hegseth-rubio-promise-more-military-strikes-on-drug-targets/85963709007/", "title": "Hegseth, Rubio promise more military strikes on drug targets", "text": "Idrees Ali, Phil Stewart, Jeff Mason and Daphne Psaledakis\n\nReuters\n\nA Sept. 2 US strike killed 11 people on a Venezuelan vessel allegedly carrying narcotics.\n\nThe Pentagon has not released specifics about the crew nor why it chose to kill those on board.\n\nMary Ellen O'Connell, an expert on international law and the use of force with the University of Notre Dame, said the operation \"violated fundamental principles of international law.\"\n\nMEXICO CITY − Senior U.S. officials said military operations against cartels would continue, setting the stage for a sustained military campaign in Latin America even as basic questions about a deadly strike against a vessel from Venezuela remained unanswered.\n\nThe U.S. military killed 11 people on Sept. 2 in a strike on a vessel from Venezuela allegedly carrying illegal narcotics, in the first known operation since President Donald Trump's recent deployment of warships to the southern Caribbean.\n\nLittle is known about the strike, including what legal justification was used or what drugs were on board, but U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said operations would continue.\n\n\"We've got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth said Sept. 3 on FOX & Friends.\n\n\"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe declined to provide details on how the operation was carried out, saying they were classified.

These things are difficult to read:\n\nGet the latest.\n\n‘Touching gloves’ on gun laws\n\nIn a sign of how shock at gun violence is reverberating, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN on Thursday that he had deputized Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a fellow Republican, to see if any bipartisan federal action on guns is possible.\n\nStay skeptical. The extent of the progress is that Cornyn said he had “touched gloves” with Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat and fierce advocate of new gun laws.\n\nCornyn, notably, is among the Republicans to pull out of a speaking role at this weekend’s National Rifle Association annual meeting in Houston, across the state from the scene of the tragedy in Uvalde. His office cited a schedule conflict earlier this week.\n\nThat top Republicans like McConnell and Cornyn want to at least appear to be open to gun measures is full-on breaking news, even if what they might ultimately support is far from sweeping action on guns.\n\nThat the show must go on at the NRA convention is a little more true to the usual politics around gun safety versus gun rights.\n\nSome are canceling on the NRA\n\nThe NRA’s convention will not be the event that was originally planned.\n\nRELATED: What to know about the NRA’s annual meeting in Houston\n\nIn addition to Cornyn, Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Rep. Dan Crenshaw, also of Texas, pulled out of the event. Abbott canceled his in-person appearance to instead attend a news conference in Uvalde, but addressed the NRA convention via a prerecorded video message.\n\n“God Bless the USA” singer Lee Greenwood told Fox he was canceling his performance because he didn’t want to appear to be endorsing “that weapon.”\n\n“That weapon killed kids, and I just couldn’t go,” Greenwood said, apparently referring to the AR platform assault rifles used by the Uvalde gunman.\n\nOther musicians, including Don McLean, Larry Gatlin and Larry Stewart, also canceled.\n\nGatlin told CNN he still supports gun rights and the NRA. He’s still a card-carrying member.\n\n“I didn’t think it was a good time to go down to Houston and have a party with them digging 21 fresh graves in the valley of my precious, beloved Texas,” he said.\n\nThe NRA influence cycle\n\nThere is an eerie similarity between this year’s annual meeting, taking place just days after the Uvalde shooting, and the annual meeting in 1999, which occurred in Denver just days after the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nOn Friday, CNN aired audio obtained by NPR of a leaked phone call among NRA officials after the Columbine shooting, when one said of canceling the convention: “If we tuck tail and run, we’re going to be accepting responsibility for what happened out there.”\n\nAnother eerie similarity: When I was looking at recent CNN coverage of the NRA, I came across this story about how even though the organization has been hobbled by financial and legal problems, it had shed a bipartisan image and aligned almost exclusively with Republicans. The story was written in March 2021 after two mass shootings in quick succession – in Georgia and Colorado – ignited a push for new gun measures on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe cycle repeats over and over.\n\nTrump and Cruz attend\n\nNot ashamed to appear in person at the NRA convention were other Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nEarlier this week, Cruz told CNN’s Jessica Dean that people pushing anew for gun laws after the slaughter in his home state were trying to politicize the tragedy.\n\n“You see Democrats and a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to restrict the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” Cruz said.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism\n\nHere’s what happened when Mark Stone, a US correspondent for the British outlet Sky News, asked Cruz this week why the US has so many more gun deaths than other developed countries.\n\nStone: “But why does this only happen in your country? I really think that’s what many people around the world just – they cannot fathom, why only in America? Why is this American exceptionalism so awful?”\n\nCruz: “I’m sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful.”\n\nStone: “I think this aspect of it …”\n\nCruz: “You’ve got your political agenda. God love you.”\n\nRead more about this Cruz exchange on guns.\n\nWhose right is it?\n\nThere has been a lot of focus this week on the gun debate in light of the abortion debate.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to remove the right of American women to seek an abortion in every state. Their thinking is that state legislatures should have that power.\n\nWhile the newly conservative court is likely to undo abortion rights, the court views as sacrosanct people’s right to own weapons, which is written as a clause into the Bill of Rights in the context of “a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State.”\n\nStates seem very unsecured now that gunmen routinely kill people going on about their daily lives.\n\nUsing anti-abortion tactics on gun owners\n\nTaking a page from a Texas law allowing citizens to sue people who facilitate abortions, California lawmakers voted to allow people to sue those who make or sell so-called ghost guns and illegal assault weapons.\n\nCNN’s Alisyn Camerota asked Texas state Rep. James White why the Texas legislature doesn’t use the same creativity it has shown in protecting unborn embryos to protect kids from being gunned down at school.\n\n“Use that same blueprint that you used for your abortion law,” Camerota suggested as an example. “Make there be waiting periods, make them have to come back to the scene more than once, make them have to answer questions. Why can’t you protect living 10-year-olds?”\n\n“We have this thing called the Constitution,” White said in answer. “What we really need to be looking at is, whether it’s in Buffalo or whether it’s in Uvalde, is these young men for some reason that have some very disturbed emotional state.”\n\nThere, too, Texas is lacking. In April, the state cut funding from the department that oversees mental health programs, according to an NBC News report.\n\nYou’ll hear that refrain from those who still choose to attend the NRA meeting this weekend, that mental health is the key to stopping shootings. You’ll hear the allegation that Democrats are politicizing the shooting. And you’ll hear the argument that more school officials need weapons.\n\nWhat you won’t hear is “God Bless the USA.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn the coming days, the US Supreme Court could hand down a decision overturning Roe v. Wade, if we are to believe a draft of the decision leaked to the media several weeks back.\n\nThose who want Roe v. Wade to stand believe it provides women with choice and freedom.\n\nFranchetta Groves Courtesy Franchetta Groves\n\nThose of us who feel differently, who fervently want to see Roe overturned, also want freedom for women. We just want it for their unborn children as well.\n\nAnd if you believe, as I do, that life starts at conception, then you also know that all life – even newly formed life – has inherent dignity and is worthy of protection.\n\nWhen news broke last month about the leak of a draft decision overturning Roe, I was elated but remained quiet. Students at the college I attend hold a variety of views about abortion, and I didn’t want to say anything that might offend others. I also saw a lot of women on social media expressing despair and outrage at what they say could be a loss of control over their bodies if Roe is overturned.\n\nI’m sympathetic about the distress felt by some in my generation, but I don’t share their view. In fact, as a young woman who is an opponent of abortion, I look forward to a post-Roe America. And I know I am in good company. In fact, according to a Gallup Poll this year, 33% of American women are “pro-life.”\n\nBased on the angry reactions from people on the abortion-rights side following that leaked draft opinion, I can only conclude that our society has failed women facing unplanned pregnancies.\n\nIt seems to me that we’ve created a culture where women are not equipped with the information and resources they need to make the best decisions for themselves before and during pregnancy – decisions that would allow them to keep their unborn children. Because they haven’t had access to comprehensive and supportive care that women need during pregnancy, many have felt, mistakenly, that abortion was their only option.\n\nThat can be different in the world that comes after Roe. Anti-abortion advocates such as myself want to create a more supportive culture for women that would encourage them to reject abortion. When they do, they will perhaps feel not so much that they’ve given up a right, as they’ve saved a life.\n\nI’ve gotten to see firsthand what a more supportive culture can look like. During my senior year of high school, I raised funds for a pregnancy center not far from my hometown in Pennsylvania. I got to learn about how these pregnancy centers truly walk with couples through every step of pregnancy and parenthood.\n\nAccording to recent news reports, a number of pregnancy centers have come under attack in recent days. That’s a shame, because this country will need them more than ever if Roe is overturned.\n\nAt the pregnancy center in my community, I learned how women can benefit from comprehensive prenatal care, even when their pregnancy is unplanned. I’m sure that such clinics around the country will do the same thing as more women seek out their services, empowering expectant mothers with the support and the resources they need. And I believe deeply that when women truly realize all the options they have at their disposal, they will choose life.\n\nI’m against abortion for another reason: I’ve seen in my own family the beauty that can come out of unexpected and unplanned pregnancies.\n\nAfter severe and almost deadly complications giving birth to me, my mother was told she couldn’t have any more children. Then a few years later, she became pregnant again.\n\nMy mother faced intense pressure from doctors and family members telling her she should get an abortion. She visited doctor after the doctor who didn’t want to take her case out of fear of complications and instead gave her medical advice that abortion was her best option.\n\nI shudder to think what would have happened if my mother had allowed herself to be pressured into ending her pregnancy. Instead, she found a doctor willing to take her on as a patient – one who honored her wish to keep her baby and helped her overcome the medical challenges she faced.\n\nEvery day, I see the outcome of my mother’s difficult but wise decision when I see the loving face of my sister Isabella, who is just a few years younger than me. I am eternally grateful that my mother chose life for both of us. My mom’s courage is a daily reminder to me that life is beautiful and worthy of protection.\n\nIn this country, we’ve seen the pendulum swing so far from “safe, legal, and rare” abortions to the practice being normalized and even praised as a positive outcome. But abortion is not empowering. My mother’s courage and the courage of so many other women – that is empowering.\n\nFranchetta Groves on the right, her sister Isabella on the left, flanking their mother Toni. Groves Family Photo\n\nAs a college senior, I’m looking forward to having a full and rich professional life when I graduate before going on to have a family of my own one day. I want to live in a society where a woman can have her child and pursue her career. That is empowering.\n\nI’d also like to live in a culture that provides effective education so that women can make smart and wise decisions for their sexual health – have the information they need to avoid potential negative consequences of premature sex. There needs to be better education on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy and the emotional impacts of sex. That’s empowering, too.\n\nI believe that abortion harms women. It allows men to get off consequence-free after having fathered a child and avoid the responsibilities of fatherhood. It undermines the beauty of motherhood and tells women that their children are a hindrance to their dreams and that life is not a blessing.\n\nAfter Roe, I believe it will be possible for our nation to be one that doesn’t cast judgment on women who become pregnant, but one that embraces them with love and compassion. And it must also be one that always protects human life and appreciates the intrinsic value of each being from the moment of conception.\n\nOver the decades, this debate has been characterized by hostility and villainization on both the abortion-rights and anti-abortion sides. Only honest dialogue can help heal a fractured culture that has so painfully betrayed women. We’ll need that dialogue once Roe is gone, and the national conversation turns to how we can support those facing crisis pregnancies and their children.\n\nAs the future of this country after Roe v. Wade is being decided, I think a lot about how I as an individual should respond – regardless of the outcome when the high court finally makes its decision.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nHow can I support the women in my life who may be facing an unexpected pregnancy? How can I engage with those who view the issue differently than myself to engage in productive dialogue so that I can grow and learn how to cultivate a society that better supports women? I hope that the highest Court in the land deciding this issue once and for all will make it possible for me to find answers to these questions.\n\nI am anxiously watching what happens, and hope that the Court will recognize the inherent dignity of all human life, and take steps to protect those in the womb, the most vulnerable in our society.", "authors": ["Franchetta Groves"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/politics/house-gun-violence-hearing-uvalde-buffalo-key-moments", "title": "Uvalde and Buffalo shootings: Key moments from Wednesday's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA House committee hearing on Wednesday provided a high-profile platform for an 11-year-old survivor of the Uvalde elementary school shooting and others affected by gun violence to tell their harrowing stories to the American public.\n\nThe hearing took place as lawmakers face pressure to act in the wake of the horrific massacre in Texas and a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in a predominantly Black neighborhood.\n\nA bipartisan group of Senate negotiators are attempting to reach a deal to respond to the tragedies, but it remains to be seen whether Congress will pass any legislation given the highly polarized political environment and widespread Republican opposition to stricter gun control.\n\nHere were some of the key moments from Wednesday’s hearing on gun violence convened by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform:\n\nUvalde shooting survivor speaks out in emotional account\n\nIn a pre-recorded video, 11-year-old Miah Cerrillo, a fourth-grade student at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, described what it was like to survive the mass shooting. It marked a rare moment for Congress to hear testimony from someone as young as Cerrillo on a subject as sensitive and disturbing as gun violence.\n\nIn the taped recording, Cerrillo said she wants “to have security” and is afraid of experiencing another school shooting.\n\nShe described trying to hide behind her teacher’s desk and said the gunman “told my teacher ‘goodnight,’ and shot her in the head.” Cerrillo said she thought the gunman would come back to the room and described covering herself in blood in an attempt to survive. “I put it all over me,” she said.\n\nMiguel Cerrillo, Miah’s father, grew emotional as he said the shooting had changed his daughter.\n\n“Today I come because I could have lost my baby girl,” he said. “She is not the same little girl that I used to play with, and run around with and do everything, because she was daddy’s little girl.”\n\n“I wish something would change, not only for our kids, but for every single kid in the world, because schools are not safe anymore,” he said. “Something needs to really change.”\n\nFamily members of shooting victims make plea for gun control\n\nShe lost her daughter in Uvalde shooting.

Hear her warning to other mothers 05:19\n\nSeveral family members of gun violence victims testified during the hearing and called for action on gun control in a direct appeal to lawmakers.\n\nFelix and Kimberly Rubio, the parents of Lexi Rubio, a 10-year-old killed in the Uvalde school massacre, testified during the hearing, and Kimberly outlined a list of demands for specific gun policies they want to see enacted.\n\n“Today, we stand for Lexi, and, as her voice, we demand action,” Kimberly said.\n\nHere is what she called for:\n\n“We seek a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. We understand that for some reason, to some people, to people with money, to people who fund political campaigns, that guns are more important than children. So at this moment we ask for progress.”\n\n“We seek to raise the age to purchase these weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.”\n\n“We seek red flag laws, stronger background checks.”\n\n“We also want to repeal gun manufacturers’ liability immunity.”\n\nZeneta Everhart, the mother of Zaire Goodman, a survivor of the Buffalo supermarket shooting, also made a plea for lawmakers to take legislative action.\n\n“Lawmakers who continuously allow these mass shootings to continue by not passing stricter gun laws should be voted out,” she said in her testimony.\n\n“As an elected official it is your duty to draft legislation that protects Zaire and all of the children and citizens in this country,” she said.\n\nWitnesses give first-hand description of the horrors of gun violence\n\nA number of the witnesses at the hearing gave first-hand descriptions of the horrific reality – and aftermath – of gun violence.\n\nRoy Guerrero, a pediatrician, described witnessing what he called the “carnage in my hometown of Uvalde.” Guerrero – who said he’s lived in Uvalde his whole life and treated children in the community before the massacre – said that he “raced” to Uvalde Memorial Hospital on the day of the mass shooting. “I’ll never forget what I saw that day,” he said. He described in graphic detail the horrors that he saw, including children whose bodies had been so brutalized by gun violence “that the only clue to their identities was blood-spattered cartoon clothes still clinging to them.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'She had blood everywhere': Uvalde pediatrician describes treating young girl 02:56 - Source: CNN 'She had blood everywhere': Uvalde pediatrician describes treating young girl 02:56\n\nEverhart, the mother of Zaire Goodman, described in detail her sons’ injuries.\n\n“My son Zaire has a hole in the right side of his neck, two on his back and another on his left leg, caused by an exploding bullet from an AR-15. As I clean his wounds, I can feel pieces of that bullet in his back. Shrapnel will be left inside of his body for the rest of his life,” she said.\n\nIn an impassioned message to lawmakers, she said, “If after hearing from me and the other people testifying here today does not move you to act on gun laws, I invite you to my home to help me clean Zaire’s wounds so that you may see up close the damage that has been caused to my son and to my community.”\n\nMother of Buffalo shooting survivor: ‘This is who we are as a nation’\n\nEverhart put a spotlight gun violence and racism in America in her testimony as she discussed the Buffalo supermarket shooting, which the Justice Department is investigating as a hate crime and “an act of racially motivated violent extremism.”\n\n“America is inherently violent. This is who we are as a nation,” she said. “The very existence of this country was founded on violence, hate and racism, with the near annihilation of my Native brothers and sisters. My ancestors, brought to America through the slave trade were the first currency of America. Let me say that again for the people in the back: My ancestors, the first currency of America, were stripped of their heritage and culture, separated from their families, bargained for on auction blocks, sold, beaten, raped and lynched. Yet I continuously hear after every mass shooting that this is not who we are as Americans and as a nation. Hear me clearly: This is exactly who we are.”\n\nEntrenched partisan divide persists in gun debate\n\nEvidence of the entrenched partisan divide in the debate over gun policy was on full display during the hearing as Democrats urged stronger gun control, while Republicans pushed back on restrictions.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, called for stricter gun control at the outset of the hearing.\n\n“Our witnesses today have endured pain and loss, yet they are displaying incredible courage by coming here to ask us to do our jobs. Let us hear their voices, let us honor their courage, let us find the same courage to pass common sense laws to protect our children,” she said.\n\n“No civilian needs an assault rifle and the Second Amendment does not protect the right to own a weapon of war. It’s time we banned assault rifles, from our streets, from our communities, from our homes,” she said.\n\nRep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the committee, said during the hearing, “knee-jerk reactions to impose gun control policies that seek to curtail our constitutional right to bear arms are not the answer.”\n\n“We should commend all law-abiding gun owners who safely use, store, and carry those firearms. Not vilify them for blatantly political purposes,” he said.\n\nMaloney later said in response, “I support the Second Amendment. I support law-abiding gun owners.

Aldrich was also listed in the online roster of the county jail.\n\nWhen asked by CNN on Tuesday if the suspect was cooperating with authorities, Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez told CNN, “We haven’t received information from him.”\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Aldrich has an attorney.\n\nAccording to investigators:\n\nAldrich was previously charged with felony menacing and first-degree kidnapping after allegedly making a bomb threat last year. But those charges were later dropped, and the records were sealed. It’s not clear why the records were sealed.\n\nThe suspect brought an AR-style weapon and a handgun to Club Q on Saturday night, but mainly used the assault-style rifle to carry out the massacre, Vasquez said.\n\nWhile Colorado has a red flag law aimed at temporarily removing gun access from those deemed a danger to themselves or others, it might not have been applied to Aldrich if his 2021 case had never been adjudicated or if no one ever pursued the intervention.\n\nSuspect to be formally charged ‘some time next week,’ DA says\n\nThe suspect is scheduled to have his first court appearance Wednesday, which will include “the advisement of the arrest charges as well as advisement of bond conditions,” Colorado’s Fourth Judicial District Attorney Michael Allen said.\n\nThe suspect will be held without bond, Allen told CNN’s Erin Burnett.\n\nThe formal filing of charges “is probably going to be some time next week or, depending on court schedules, the week after that,” Allen said, adding he expects charges in “roughly 10 days.”\n\nAnd while murder charges will offer the longest sentencing options, Allen said he expects more charges on top of those.\n\n“Colorado has biased-motivated crime statutes, which most people understand as hate crimes. We are definitely looking at that, based on the facts involved in this case,” Allen said. “And if there’s evidence to charge it, we’ll absolutely charge those as well.”\n\nAnalyst: Mass shootings have increased since the assault rifle ban was lifted\n\nThe United States had an assault-style weapons ban that was implemented in 1994 and expired in 2004.\n\nThat ban, while not perfect, “had the effect of limiting the number of high-capacity semi-automatic weapons … that were in circulation,” CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Andrew McCabe said.\n\n“We saw a great decline in mass shooting events and deaths during that time,” said McCabe, a former deputy director for the FBI. “This is not even really debatable.”\n\nQuestions emerge over why previous charges were dropped\n\nIt’s not clear why the felony charges against Aldrich were dropped following the 2021 report of a bomb threat.\n\nVideo obtained by CNN showed Aldrich apparently ranting about the police and challenging them to breach his mother’s home, where he was holed up.\n\n“I’ve got the f**king sh*theads outside, look at that, they’ve got a bead on me,” Aldrich says on the video, pointing the camera at a window with blinds covering it. “You see that right there? F**king sh*theads got their f**king rifles out.”\n\nLater in the video, Aldrich says, “If they breach, I’mma f**king blow it to holy hell.”\n\nHe ends the video with what seems like a message to law enforcement outside: “So, uh, go ahead and come on in, boys! Let’s f**king see it!”\n\nThe video does not actually show any officers outside the house and it’s not clear from the video whether Aldrich had any weapons in the house.\n\nSeveral hours after the initial police call, the local sheriff department’s crisis negotiations unit was able to get Aldrich to leave the house. Authorities did not find any explosives in the home, the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nAlrich was arrested and booked into the El Paso County Jail on two counts of felony menacing and three counts of first-degree kidnapping, according to a 2021 news release from the sheriff’s office.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the bomb threat case was resolved, but the Colorado Springs Gazette reported the district attorney’s office said no formal charges were pursued in the case. The district attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nAldrich purchased the two weapons brought to Club Q on Saturday night, law enforcement sources told CNN this week. But it’s not clear whether the AR-style rifle and handgun were purchased before or after the 2021 case.\n\nAldrich’s arrest in connection to the bomb threat would not have shown up in background checks because the case was never adjudicated, the charges were dropped and the records were sealed. It’s unclear what prompted the sealing of the records.\n\nA red flag law ‘was not perfect in this circumstance’\n\nIn 2019, Colorado passed a controversial red flag law that allows family members, a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed a risk.\n\nWhen asked Monday why the red flag law wasn’t used in Aldrich’s case, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it was “too early” to say.\n\n“I don’t have enough information to know exactly what the officers knew,” Weiser said.\n\nOne caveat with Colorado’s red flag law is that it requires family members, police or others to actively start the process of trying to temporarily remove gun access from someone who might cause harm.\n\n“The Colorado red flag law works when a family member or a cohabitant or a police officer proactively files the requisite paperwork and go before a judge and make the argument that someone should not have access to a weapon,” McCabe said.\n\n“There’s nothing that I’m aware of that requires a red flag law kind of inquiry anytime someone is brought in” to law enforcement, he said.\n\n“It is not clear to me from this situation whether (the suspect) was subjected to a temporary restraining order or any sort of mental health evaluation. Even if he was, it is not clear that there is a requirement of red flag consideration when there is a TRO or mental health evaluation. It’s entirely voluntary.”\n\nSen. John Hickenlooper, a former Colorado governor, said he believes there are imperfections with the red flag law.\n\n“Obviously, the implementation was not perfect in this circumstance,” Hickenlooper said Tuesday. “Far less than perfect. It was a failure by any measure.”\n\n5 more victims join hundreds of others lost to mass shootings this year\n\nOfficials identified the slain victims as Daniel Aston, Raymond Green Vance, Kelly Loving, Ashley Paugh and Derrick Rump.\n\nSo far this year, the US has recorded at least 605 mass shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN tallies incidents in which four or more people are killed or wounded, excluding the shooter.\n\nBarrett Hudson survived the massacre despite being shot seven times as he tried to flee the gunfire.\n\n“Seven bullets missed my spine, missed my liver, missed my colon,” Hudson told CNN. “I got really, really lucky.”\n\nBut Hudson and other victims who survived are marred by grief over the five lives lost.\n\nAshley Paugh leaves behind her daughter Ryleigh, who “was her whole world,” Paugh’s family said in a statement.\n\n“She meant everything to this family, and we can’t even begin to understand what it will mean to not have her in our lives,” her family said.\n\nPaugh worked at the nonprofit Kids Crossing, which aims to help foster children find homes, the family said. She was also involved with helping the LGBTQ community find welcoming foster placements.\n\nDerrick Rump was a bartender at Club Q. The venue was a place where he “found a community of people that he loved really much, and he felt that he could shine there – and he did,” his sister Julia Kissling CNN affiliate WFMZ.\n\nKelly Loving’s sister offered her condolences to the other families in mourning as she grappled with her own grief.\n\n“My condolences go out to all the families who lost someone in this tragic event, and to everyone struggling to be accepted in this world,” Tiffany Loving said in the statement to CNN.\n\n“My sister was a good person. She was loving and caring and sweet. Everyone loved her. Kelly was a wonderful person.”\n\nRaymond Green Vance, 22, had just gotten a job at a Colorado Springs FedEx distribution center and “was thrilled to have received his first paycheck,” his family said in a statement.\n\n“His own family and friends are completely devastated by the sudden loss of a son, grandson, brother, nephew, and cousin loved by so many,” his family said.\n\nAn Army veteran used the gunman’s own weapon to attack him\n\nThe carnage could have been even worse if not for the bravery of two people inside the club who fought the gunman, police said.\n\nRichard Fierro and Thomas James subdued the attacker before officers arrived just minutes after the shooting started, police said.\n\nFierro, a former Army major who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he took a gun from the assailant and used it to hit him.\n\nThe violence and trauma at the club Saturday night was akin to that of a war zone, the veteran said.\n\nFierro was at the nightclub celebrating a birthday with his wife and daughter. His daughter’s boyfriend, Vance, was also there but did not survive.\n\nHe became emotional talking about Vance and the others who were killed.\n\n“I’m not a hero,” Fierro said. “I’m just a guy that wanted to protect his kids and wife, and I still didn’t get to protect her boyfriend.”", "authors": ["Holly Yan Aya Elamroussi", "Holly Yan", "Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/military-releases-videos-august-drone-strike-killed-civilians", "title": "Afghanistan: US military releases videos of Kabul drone strike that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US military released videos Wednesday of the botched August 29 drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 Afghan civilians, including seven children.\n\nThe newly released videos show the view from above Kabul as the military tracked a white Toyota Corolla through parts of the city, believing that it was an ISIS-K car laden with explosives and building a case for targeting it with a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Pentagon defended the strike at first, claiming it had killed an ISIS-K operative planning an imminent attack on US forces during the final days of the evacuation and withdrawal from Afghanistan. Only three days earlier, an ISIS-K suicide bomber had killed 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans at Abbey Gate, the key entry point to the airport.\n\nWith ongoing threats of another attack, the US strike cell believed it was tracking an ISIS-K member from a terrorist hideout as he made his way through the city over the course of eight hours.\n\nIn reality, the military was tracking Zamarai Ahmadi, an Afghan who worked for Nutrition and Education International, a nongovernmental organization focused on food security. Ahmadi had applied for a special immigrant visa and intended to bring his family to the United States.\n\nApproximately three weeks after the strike, the military acknowledged it was a tragic mistake that had killed 10 innocent civilians. A subsequent Air Force review of the circumstances around the strike found “no violation of law, including the law of war.”\n\nNo one has been held accountable for the mistake, even as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has promised an increased focus on holding the military to a higher standard on avoiding civilian casualties and harm.\n\nSteven Kwon, the president of Nutrition and Education International, criticized the decision to not punish any US military personnel, saying, “When the Pentagon absolves itself of accountability, it sends a dangerous and misleading message that its actions were somehow justified, increasing security risks and making evacuation even more urgent.”\n\nIn the longest of the three videos, the car is seen making its way along the streets of Kabul in grainy black and white footage. About five minutes into the 15-minute video, the car reaches its final destination and begins slowly reversing into a parking spot.\n\nSeven minutes and seven seconds into the video, the words “LRD LASE DES” appear, indicating a laser designator has identified and ranged the target. At least two or three people are seen in the grainy video milling about the car. Thirty-three seconds later, the car vanishes beneath a bright fireball.\n\nThe drone video zooms out as the explosion recedes, with smoke pouring out of the destroyed car. The drone continues circling overhead as people move toward the scene of the explosion. Approximately three minutes later, the video switches from black and white to color, and crowds can be seen forming around the site of the explosion. People stand on rooftops overhead, trying to pour buckets of water on the remnants of the car to extinguish the flames.\n\n“While the strike was intended for what was believed to be an imminent threat to our troops at Hamad Karzai International Airport, none of the family members killed are now believed to have been connected to ISIS-K or threats to our troops,” said Capt. Bill Urban, spokesman for US Central Command, upon release of the videos. “We deeply regret the loss of life that resulted from this strike.”\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees military operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East, released the videos in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The New York Times, which first reported on them.\n\nA second video, five minutes in length, shows the Corolla in color and higher quality in the minutes before and after the strike, though the car does disappear behind a building for part of the video. The video switches to black and white at approximately the halfway point as a white diamond marker appears above the car. The marker turns purple seconds before the missile hits the car and an explosion fills the screen. The video then reverts to color and, shortly thereafter, crowds begin forming at the scene. The video then pans away from the explosion.\n\nA third video, also about five minutes long, shows a drone observing a number of locations in Kabul before it focuses on a parking lot with a number of parked white cars.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Ellie Kaufman", "Oren Liebermann", "Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

Trump’s order invokes former President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative, which detractors labeled “Star Wars.”\n\nBut much like Reagan’s push for total nuclear defense, major technological and budgetary hurdles exist for Trump’s vision, and policymakers and experts disagree on its feasibility and whether investing in homeland missile defense makes Americans safer at all.\n\nToday's U.S. missile defenses are “neither intended for (nor) capable of defending the homeland against the ballistic missiles of … Russia and China,” the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in a report Dec. 30.\n\nThe country instead “deters” large nuclear strikes by maintaining a nuclear arsenal powerful enough and resilient enough to destroy any foe that attacks. During the Cold War, that uneven balance of power and shared vulnerability between the U.S. and Soviet Union was coined “mutually assured destruction,” or MAD.\n\nAn ‘aspirational’ plan\n\nTrump‘s plan, which explicitly aims to expand missile defense to cover the U.S. homeland against all attacks, is “aspirational,” said Jon Ludwigson, director of the Government Accountability Office’s contracting and national security acquisitions team.\n\nHe and other experts said meeting the order’s goals may take a push, because current missile defense efforts struggle to meet targets less ambitious than Trump's.\n\nThe Missile Defense Agency, tasked with developing and maintaining U.S. air defense, has spent more than $194 billion, including $10.4 billion in the 2022 fiscal year. But the agency’s approach to testing has faced criticism, and the Defense Department \"lacks comprehensive guidance for sustaining\" key parts of the system, like missile interceptors and sensors, according to a GAO report in 2023.\n\nDespite a \"considerable amount of testing\" that indicated success in knocking missiles out of the sky, \"we've had concerns that deliveries have been below their plan and that they have not completed all the testing that they planned,\" Ludwigson said.\n\nThe U.S. now maintains 44 ground-based interceptors that work by physically striking an incoming intercontinental ballistic missile warhead – 40 at Alaska's Fort Greely and four at Vandenburg Air Force Base in California, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. Congress recently directed the construction of more for the East Coast.\n\nThe agency is at work on an $18 billion plan to replace 31 of those missiles with new and more advanced interceptors by 2028.\n\nBut that timeline is \"optimistic,\" another GAO report found.\n\nLudwigson cited \"interruptions in production\" as well as \"struggles with workforce and parts availability\" in recent years and during the COVID-19 pandemic for the failure to meet goals. These consistent shortcomings pose a “challenge,” he said.\n\nDoubling down\n\nThe order signals a significant expansion in U.S. missile defense goals, funding and strategy.\n\nTrump directed the Pentagon to plan a multi-layer defense system against enemy ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, among other aerial threats. The order further calls for both increased deployment of existing tech and development of tools like space-based interceptors, new sensors and “non-kinetic” missile defense capabilities, such as particle beams.\n\nRebeccah Heinrichs, a top nuclear and missile defense expert at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank, described the push as “a monumental leap in U.S. policy.”\n\nRobert Soofer, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy during Trump’s first term, characterized the order as “bold” and “broad.”\n\n“This is even more bold, I would suggest, than Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nSome parts of the plan appear straightforward and have the support of arms control advocates. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, described Trump’s call to expand proven short- and medium-range missile defenses as “prudent, even if it’s difficult to achieve.”\n\nHigher-end technologies like space-based interceptors and “non-kinetic” weapons, by contrast, are in their infancy and will require significant investment and testing to determine their viability – and even supporters of expanded missile defense recognize the challenge.\n\nLawmakers, including House Armed Services Committee chair Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., have signaled their willingness to invest in such development. A pair of Republican senators introduced a stand-alone bill Thursday that would pour $19.5 billion into missile defense efforts.\n\nThe Hudson Institute’s Heinrichs acknowledged the president’s order “requires initiating and accelerating technologies.” She argued that the benefits – which include increasing “the chances of maintaining peace between” the U.S., Russia and China – outweigh the costs.\n\nThe paradox of defense\n\nYet a hotly contested aspect of the “Iron Dome” plan is whether increased investment in nuclear missile defense makes the world – or America – a safer or a more dangerous place.\n\nMany – if not all – conservative officials believe that the country must bolster its defenses against all nuclear threats, even large-scale ones traditionally deterred by mutual vulnerability.\n\nArms control advocates, as well as a significant portion of liberal policymakers, fear doing so undermines the uneasy trust of mutual vulnerability and encourages nuclear foes to develop dangerous new technologies to defeat defense systems.\n\nKimball, the Arms Control Association head, said Trump’s plan could “encourage our adversaries to build up their offensive forces and to do so in a way that our defenses can never catch up.” He argued that “trying to pursue a so-called ‘dome’ (to) protect the United States, in the long run, is unaffordable, technologically infeasible and counterproductive.”\n\nAnother arms control advocate, Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the idea of missile defense “sounds really good” but isn’t moored in reality.\n\n“Who wouldn’t want to be defended?” Grego said. “But when you … think about how realistic it is, what kind of protection you would get, how expensive it is, and how easy it is to defeat, you end up … thinking it’s really not worthwhile, especially not against large adversaries like Russia or China.”\n\nRight-leaning experts disagree.\n\nHeinrichs said limiting the aims of U.S. missile defense programs to date “has not encouraged (our) adversaries to take a more benign approach.” She criticized “decades-old views that missile defense is provocative or technically infeasible,” claiming that better defenses will “help restore stability.”\n\nKyle Balzer, a historian who studies nuclear strategy at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed to Israel’s largely successful multinational defense against a 2023 ballistic missile attack from Iran. He argued Israel’s defenses (which inspired the executive order’s “Iron Dome” moniker) allowed regional tensions to ease.\n\n“Israel was able to defend itself, and then think about (retaliating), and then think about it some more … and then eventually respond with a calibrated, selective attack of its own,” Balzer said.\n\nUltimately, he argued, the U.S. cementing its ability to defeat “a limited coercive (nuclear) missile attack gives the president one more reason why he doesn’t have to immediately respond … in kind.”\n\nDavis Winkie's role covering nuclear threats and national security at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Outrider Foundation and Journalism Funding Partners.

The protesters marched from streets around the Capitol to the Department of Labor building on Constitution Avenue − where Elon Musk’s DOGE officials were visiting for the day. Musk, a staunch Trump ally, has been executing Trump's cost-cutting initiative to reduce the size of the U.S. government.\n\nCars passing by the marchers honked in a show of support.\n\nEarlier in the day, several hundred people gathered outside the Capitol for a demonstration against Trump's efforts to diminish the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Rallygoers bundled up in puffy winter coats, hats, and gloves held up signs against Trump.\n\n“Don’t let democracy die,” “Elon cheats on video games,'' “Checks and balances make America great,” some of the signs read. Demonstrators also chanted at Democratic lawmakers who spoke at the rally, telling them, “Do your job!”\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Democrats plan to fight the new policies in court, in state legislatures, and in Congress. Fellow Virginia Sen. Mark Warner urged protesters to take their concerns to GOP lawmakers as well.\n\n\"Don't just show up here,\" Warner said. \"We are only going to break this when we have Republicans willing to stand up as well. Put the pressure not just on us but on everyone, every elected official.\"\n\nTrump has signed a flurry of executive orders and taken other actions since his Jan. 20 inauguration to remake and reduce the size of America's 2.2 million-strong federal workforce. Diversity programs have been targeted; government web pages have been scrubbed of gender references.\n\nTrump accuses USAID of being 'corrupt': Implies the agency's days are numbered\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ New Yorkers protested outside the Midtown Manhattan office of Sen.

Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois to block Trump's efforts.\n\nMusk the target of ire from Austin protesters\n\nMany of Musk's fellow residents in Austin, Texas, vociferously expressed their disapproval of the multibillionaire at a protest Wednesday in front of the state Capitol and a march through downtown Austin.\n\nThousands participated in the demonstration against Trump's attempts at remaking the federal government and the country's immigration system, and a large number took issue with Musk and his associates at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe clamor from the rally could be heard from inside Capitol offices and the Senate chamber as protesters chanted, \"No more Musk, stop the coup,\" \"Reclaim our county, take back our rights,\" \"All are welcome here.\"\n\nMusk has brought numerous jobs to Texas by moving the headquarters of some of his businesses to the state, including Tesla and SpaceX, but his work in reshaping sections of the government has drawn a strong backlash.\n\n\"Elon Musk has your number,'' said one sign, a reference to DOGE gaining access to federal employee data.\n\n− Bayliss Wagner, Austin American-Statesman\n\nDemonstrator in Michigan: 'I would love for this movement to grow'\n\nProtesters in Lansing, Michigan, navigated the icy lawn in the state capitol and enjoyed encouragement from nearby drivers who honked in support.\n\nThey waved signs saying \"Stop Project 2025,\" and \"Dump Trump\" and \"End the Plague of Facism,\" among many others. Musk and his team at Trump's newly created Department of Government Efficiency were a popular target on protesters' signs.\n\nHomemade signs showed the breadth of issues that drew the demonstrators together: corporate greed, immigration, women, and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\"Even if this doesn’t have a tangible impact, it’s still the right thing to do,\" said Mia Foster, 32, of St. Joseph, Michigan. \"I would love for this movement to grow but I think people are scared for their lives.\"\n\nFoster told The Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, that she remains afraid. \"I’m trans so I see the rhetoric coming, and I genuinely believe that it’s going to be mass slaughter. I don’t see a way that rhetoric like calling us monsters and pedophiles doesn’t end in that.\"\n\nFoster said she took some comfort in being a part of the crowd. \"I still feel the anxiety but just knowing I’m not alone is helpful,\" Foster added.\n\n- Ken Palmer and Clara Hendrickson, Detroit Free Press\n\nSome Oregon protestors travel through snow\n\nAround 400 people gathered at the Oregon State Capitol State Park shouting chants like “This is what democracy looks like,” \"No justice, no peace,\" and “Hey hey, ho ho, Elon Musk has got to go.\"\n\nDemonstrators also held signs saying \"Dump Trump,\" \"Love thy neighbor,\" \"Stop the coup\" and \"Make sense not chaos.\" Passing drivers honked in support and shouted out the window, prompting cheers from the growing crowd.\n\nMonika Katz traveled through the snow from southern Oregon to Wednesday's protest. She said the weather didn’t give her any hesitation.\n\n“My group drove up hours through the snow because Project (2025) scared us,” Katz told the Salem Statesman Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. “It targets our immigrants, our Native Americans, our Indigenous people, women and children, and it's unsafe, and we're here to stop it.”\n\nKathleen Krauss, 64, said she and her husband Evan Krauss learned about the protest Wednesday morning on Bluesky. She said they are both retired from civil service jobs and felt it was their “duty” to come.\n\nKrauss, trained as a history teacher, said her earliest political memories are of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. She said she is disturbed by the administration's direction.\n\n“This is the most endangered our country has ever been,” Kraus said.\n\n— Isabel Funk and Whitney Woodworth, Salem Statesman Journal\n\nCalifornia demonstrator hopes protests will raise awareness\n\nHundreds of residents in Coachella Valley, California, joined the thousands of people protesting Wednesday against Trump and his policies, the Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nAt least two protests — one criticizing Trump's immigration policies and another condemning his administration's actions more broadly — were held in Cathedral City and Palm Desert, respectively.\n\nHolding a large sign that read \"Not my president,\" Don Nowak said he heard about the protest a day before and came out “to stand up for our rights and our democracy.” The Palm Desert resident said he was specifically concerned about Musk having access to government data as well as steps taken at the FBI and the Department of Justice since Trump took office.\n\nNowak was hopeful that the protest and others like it will prompt more people to begin to see the everyday impacts of the new administration’s actions.\n\n\"A lot of people don’t have the time or energy to even pay attention to the news, so they have to see their fellow residents stand up and say something,\" Nowak said. \"Maybe they’ll go, 'Wait a minute. Maybe I need to pay attention to that.'\"\n\n— Tom Coulter and Ani Gasparyan, Palm Springs Desert Sun\n\n'Vote them out,' crowd chants in Columbia, South Carolina\n\nAbout 300 people demonstrated outside the South Carolina state Capitol in Columbia on Wednesday, many of them chanting \"Vote them out'' in protest of the Trump administration policies, the Greenville News, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe central theme among speakers and participants was their opposition to Trump's adoption of far-right proposals from the conservative Project 2025 policy handbook, after distancing himself from them during the presidential campaign.\n\nMelanie Trimble, a therapist and activist from Columbia, said she attended the rally as an ally of people who live in fear.\n\n\"I have friends who are afraid about healthcare and housing, food, their children's education, going to college, whether they'll be attacked in the street,'' she said. \"I'm here ... trying to make our government work for all of us.\"\n\n− Terry Benjamin II and Alex Hicks Jr., Greenville News\n\nHow a protest started on Reddit\n\nStanding among hundreds of people who gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse Wednesday, Christian Hess, the coordinator for the state's 50501 protest march, felt pride that so many people answered the call to protest Trump's policies.\n\nThe idea started as a grassroots initiative on Reddit as a decentralized way to protest the abundance of executive orders signed by Trump. Hess didn’t know how many people would show up and was shocked to see more than 400 people marching in Indianapolis.\n\nFor Hess, the decision to step back into politics was difficult. Almost a decade ago, he worked as an intern in the Statehouse.\n\n“Things have gotten so bad, and the conversation has gotten so heated in this country, that I couldn’t sit idly by anymore,” Hess told the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n— Noe Padilla, Indianapolis Star\n\nFocus on local action, speaker tells Pennsylvania protesters\n\nIn Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, protesters outside the state Capitol on Wednesday denounced the Trump administration, Project 25, and Musk as they waved rainbow banners and American flags. One sign called for Trump's impeachment − a little over two weeks after he returned to the Oval Office.\n\nState Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta emphasized the importance of local action in a speech, urging those in attendance to focus on city councils, school boards, and politicians in Washington.\n\n“There is no one, and I mean it, no one, coming to save us,” the Philadelphia Democrat said. “But here is the good news, my friends: We are going to save ourselves.”\n\n− Bethany Rodgers, Beaver County Times\n\nIowans denounce assault on DEI, mass deportations\n\nDemonstrators in the Iowa capital of Des Moines chanted \"never again'' as hundreds assailed Trump's assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and his plans for mass deportations.\n\nWhat had been a peaceful demonstration devolved in the afternoon when four protesters were taken out of the Iowa Capitol in handcuffs after interrupting a scheduled Moms for Liberty event in the building's rotunda.\n\nDes Moines lawyer Ben Lynch told the crowd to continue standing up against Trump during his four-year term.\n\n\"The rule of law is abandoned right now so we need to use our voices and all stand together, because marches and rallies like this is what gets people together,\" Lynch said through a bullhorn.\n\n− Sabine Martin, Des Moines Register\n\nFrom North Carolina to DC, one protester vows to 'be the Tiananmen tank guy'\n\nStewart Rabitz, 70, drove up from his home in Wake Forest, North Carolina, early Wednesday to attend the protest outside the U.S. Capitol. Rabitz isn’t new to the anti-Trump protest circuit − he’s been hitting the streets since the early days of Trump's first term and said he’s faced off against the Proud Boys.\n\nThis time feels different, Rabitz said, because of the quick pace of Trump’s executive orders. The sentiment among the opposition to Trump has also changed.\n\n“I think a lot of people are now realizing that walking around with signs, people got to get their hands dirty,” he said.Asked whether he feared retribution, Rabitz said: \"You can’t be afraid. I’m willing to be the first one. I’ll be the Tiananmen tank guy.\"\n\nProtests planned in every state\n\nThe 50501 Movement − 50 states, 50 protests, one day − planned demonstrations \"supporting the free expression of regular Americans’ dissatisfaction with the embrace of Project 2025.\"\n\nProject 2025 is a lengthy list of proposals that would expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision. Protest organizers say Project 2025 seeks to target marginalized groups, heighten surveillance, restrict reproductive rights and slash funding for crucial services such as education and health care while dismantling \"the freedoms we cherish.\"\n\nThe 50501 group is also opposed to Trump's executive orders such as cracking down on illegal immigration and pardoning people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nColumbus protesters take issue with Trump, Musk\n\nTrump's policies and Musk's government-slashing efforts were at the heart of a demonstration that drew hundreds Wednesday to the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, the Columbus Dispatch reported.\n\nProtesters carried signs with messages like, \"Worst. President. Ever'' and \"I want my privacy back − arrest Elon Musk!''\n\nSeveral of Trump's initial executive actions zeroed in on immigrants, as he revoked Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans and sought to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\"As a refugee to this country, naturalized, I recognize how lucky I am to have that security,\" Katja Ryabtseva, who hails from Azerbaijan, told the newspaper. \"I can't sit at home knowing that there are families, children out there trying to get documentation again and are going to be kicked out.\"\n\n− Donovan Hunt, Columbus Dispatch\n\n'Deport Elon': Signs, Mexican flags at Denver rally\n\nSeveral hundred people demonstrated outside the Colorado Capitol building in downtown Denver on Wednesday afternoon, some waving Mexican flags, according to local media reports, which later said the protest grew into the thousands in the evening.\n\nOne person held a sign that said \"Deport Elon\" in reference to Musk, a native of South Africa who is leading Trump's efforts to slash the size of the federal government. Another carried a sign reading \"We are all immigrants.\"\n\nTrump has targeted the Denver suburb of Aurora, saying it has been taken over by Venezuelan gangs.\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nLawyer, nurse among those taking time off work to protest\n\nSeveral attendees took off work to attend the USAID and 50501 rallies that converged outside the Capitol.\n\nRavenna Romack, a lawyer and military spouse, said she protested on the Capitol steps every day this week. Romack, 40, said she's most concerned about Musk’s growing power in the federal government and his team circumventing Congress.\n\n“People are feeling galvanized right now because it's become personal,” said Romack, who saw Wednesday's protest as a continuation of the resistance movement against Trump that has existed for years.\n\nNathan Alexander, a 32-year-old military veteran, stood at the edge of the crowd with a cart filled with first aid materials, water, granola bars, hand warmers, and flask masks. Alexander said he works as a nurse at a hospital in Maryland but opted Wednesday to provide emergency service to anyone who needed it at the rally. He said he paid for all the supplies with his own money.\n\n“That's how important it is to me to make sure that everybody knows … we're all in this together,” said Alexander, who was wearing a rainbow pin. “Rising tides raise all ships.’’\n\nAFL-CIO rallies against Musk's labor actions\n\nOne of the nation's largest labor unions, the AFL-CIO, rallied Wednesday at the Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., concerned Musk and his team may target the department next.\n\nUsers shared posts about the rally on social media, including on the Reddit section where Wednesday demonstrations across the nation were organized.\n\n\"Working people deserve a STRONG Department of Labor that works for them, NOT for billionaires and corporate CEOs,'' the AFL-CIO said in a post on the X platform, which Musk owns.\n\nAmong the speakers at the rally were AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler; Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat; and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents D.C.\n\n\"This is where the movement begins, this is where the fight begins,\" Markey said.\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\nContributing: Bonnie Bolden, Mississippi Clarion Ledger; Lori Comstock, USA TODAY NETWORK; Seth Harrison/The Journal News", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/22/lion-man-garden-state-bud-amelia-earhart-news-around-states/50125535/", "title": "Lion Man, Garden State bud: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCORRECTION: This article originally misstated details about a museum in the works in Atchison, Kansas, the birthplace of famed aviator Amelia Earhart.

Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world.\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: An organization that has staged dozens of protests against a Confederate monument in north Alabama filed suit contending the city is trying to limit the demonstrations in violation of free-speech guarantees. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Project Say Something and its founder, Camille Bennett, claims the city and Police Chief Ron Tyler are trying to clamp down on the protests by telling the group when, where and how it can demonstrate against the monument, located at the Lauderdale County Courthouse. Bennett said the organization, a nonprofit she founded about eight years ago, has tried to work with the city, the TimesDaily reports. “Alabama has a long history of confronting racial injustice through peaceful demonstration, and it is imperative that we not lose that ability to speak truth to power when the situation demands it,” Bennett said in a statement. The city has not responded to the federal lawsuit in court, and city officials declined comment. Project Say Something held as many as 175 demonstrations at the monument in 2020 but cut back the following year because the city used its noise and parade permit ordinances to discourage them, the lawsuit said. The chief relocated the demonstrations to a “protest zone” away from the courthouse to shrink the potential audience, it claimed, and he threatened to issue citations.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland is in the midst of her first visit to the state in the role, including a visit to a community at the center of a long-running dispute over a proposed land exchange aimed at building a road through a national wildlife refuge. Residents of King Cove have seen a road as a life and safety issue. Haaland was in King Cove on Wednesday with Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Dunleavy’s office said. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge to Cold Bay, which is about 18 miles away and has an all-weather airport. The refuge is near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. “The federal government needs to consider human safety and quality of life factors for residents in King Cove. The locals deserve to be heard by the federal government,” Dunleavy said in a statement. A U.S. Justice Department attorney last summer said Haaland had not decided what position she would take on a proposed land exchange, saying Haaland planned to review the record and visit King Cove before making a decision. A planned trip to Alaska last year didn’t materialize.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Republican House speaker on Thursday was named one of five recipients of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage award for his refusal to consider overturning the 2020 election results despite massive pressure from ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters. Speaker Rusty Bowers rebuffed repeated direct efforts by Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to overturn results that saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona. Trump and Giuliani urged Bowers in a phone call to retroactively change Arizona law to allow the Legislature to chose a different slate of presidential electors than those picked by the voters. “I am very grateful for this honor yet cannot help but feel undeserving of it,” Bowers said in a statement. “Honoring my oath and the people’s choices at the ballot box are not heroic acts – they are the least that Arizonans should expect from the people elected to serve them.” The award created by Kennedy’s family in 1989 is designed “to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most” and is given each year to one or more political figures. This year’s award honors those who showed “courage to protect and defend democracy in the United States and abroad.” The awards will be presented at a May 22 ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A local agency says it’s seeing an uptick in calls for help after the end of a statewide rent relief program. The Arkansas Department of Human Services closed its program April 1, leaving many renters struggling to find additional avenues to keep their families housed. The Arkansas Rent Relief Program provided up to 15 months of relief for unpaid rent and utilities due on or after April 1, 2020. As of the beginning of this month, about 30,000 applications had been paid at the close of the program, totaling $92.5 million in funding distributed. Some households are still waiting for assistance as their applications are being processed. As of April 7, about 3,700 applications were still being processed across the state. In the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey taken from Jan. 26 to Feb. 7, 41.4% of Arkansas households surveyed said they were not current on rent or mortgage, making eviction or foreclosure either very likely or somewhat likely in the next two months. Dana Crawford, family services manager at the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, said she has seen an uptick in calls looking for help following the closure of the state’s rental assistance program. “We did have the Arkansas Fresh Start, but we have since depleted those funds,” Crawford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Parents of middle and high school students in the state would be warned about the dangers of firearms every year under a measure that advanced Wednesday. But they would no longer be required to tell school officials if they keep guns in the house, under the revised legislation. The state Senate Education Committee three weeks ago rejected the firearms reporting requirement as an invasion of privacy. So Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino reworked his bill, eliminating the parental reporting. The narrower version cleared the same committee Wednesday on a 5-1 vote. His revised bill requires schools to include information on the safe storage of firearms in the annual notifications they send home to parents of students in middle and high schools, starting in the 2023-24 school year. Legislation with a similar requirement has already passed the California Assembly. More than two-thirds of school shootings involve weapons taken from the students’ home, friends or relatives, Portantino said. “This is an attempt to try to empower school districts to do everything they can to make the school environment safe,” he said. “This errs on the side of caution.” If there are threats or perceived threats of school shootings, the proposal requires investigators to check the state’s firearm database to see if the suspect’s family has registered firearms.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: The police chief who led the force in the Denver suburb when a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater a decade ago is returning to temporarily lead the embattled department following the firing of its last chief. Daniel J. Oates, who served as police chief in Aurora from 2005 to 2014 before retiring as police chief in Miami Beach, Florida, will serve as interim chief and help in the selection of the next police chief, the city announced Wednesday. City manager Jim Twombly said he hired Oates “because he has established trust within our community and many of our officers.” Earlier this month Twombly fired Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who was hired in 2020 as the city faced scrutiny over the death of Elijah McClain – a case that received widespread attention in the wake of protests of racial injustice and police brutality. McClain died after being stopped by police, put in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine in 2019. Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted in McClain’s death last year. Wilson acted quickly to fire officers for misconduct, including officers who took and shared photos appearing to mock McClain’s death. Twombly praised Wilson’s community outreach but said he fired her because of concerns about her leadership and management of the department, without getting into specifics. Wilson disputed Twombly’s assessment and alleged she was forced out for political reasons.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Emergency responders rescued 50 dogs and cats from a fire at a pet boarding facility after three people had escaped the flames by jumping from a second-floor window, authorities said Thursday. The fire was reported shortly before midnight Wednesday in a two-story building on Post Road East, Assistant Chief Jeff Gootman of the Westport Fire Department said in a news release. Firefighters responded and found heavy fire on the second floor of the building, which housed a pet boarding facility on the first floor and basement and an apartment on the second floor, Gootman said. After firefighters extinguished the flames, they searched the building and determined that the three people on the second floor had jumped to safety from a window, Gootman said. None required hospitalization. Westport firefighters and police officers removed approximately 50 dogs and cats from the boarding facility, Gootman said. The cause of the fire was under investigation Thursday.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After decades of criticism over use of force and a strained relationship with the community, the Wilmington Police Department’s policies and procedures are coming under legal scrutiny. A federal lawsuit filed against Wilmington officers involved in the 2020 shooting of a man found sleeping in an SUV lists years of departmental procedures claiming city police are unable to handle many situations, including making contact with unarmed individuals. The civil lawsuit touches on documented accounts of how Wilmington officers have not been taught to give proper verbal warning prior to using deadly force or to take cover when officers believe someone is armed. The lawsuit also claims department supervisors, among others, fail to check that officers use their standard-issue equipment and fail to prohibit officers from making false statements. These failures create unwritten policies, allowing Wilmington officers to engage in acts of excessive force without accountability, which in turn result in injury to civilians, according to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Jabri K. Hunter, who was shot by a Wilmington officer April 12, 2020. “These inadequate training policies existed prior to the date of this incident and continue to this day,” said the lawsuit targeting the officers involved in the shooting, Chief Robert Tracy and the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and other community leaders announced Thursday that the city’s annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness showed a decline for the sixth straight year, WUSA-TV reports. Over the past year, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness has dropped 13.7%. Since 2016, when the Bowser administration began its Homeward DC plan, homelessness has declined by 47% total, data show. For the 2016 Point in Time count, 8,350 people were experiencing homelessness. In 2022, that number was 4,410. That’s the lowest recorded number going back to at least 2005, the mayor’s office said. The 2022 results also show declines in family homelessness (down 14%), homelessness among single adults (down 12%), and chronic homelessness for families (down 26%) and single adults (down 22%). “These results are a culmination of years of working together – across government, with our community partners and providers, and with residents in all eight wards – to implement Homeward DC and build systems and resources that meet the needs of D.C. residents,” Bowser said in a statement. “While we are proud of these results, we know there’s more work to do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Black lawmakers staged a sit-in on the Florida House floor Thursday to protest a congressional map pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that they say will diminish the state’s Black representation in the U.S. House. The DeSantis map would increase Florida’s GOP presence and dismantle two districts now represented by Black members of Congress. As debate on the maps was nearing an end, Reps. Angie Nixon and Tray McCurdy opened up their suit jackets to display “Stop the Black Attack” T-shirts and shouted the same phrase. They sat on the state seal in front of the House speaker’s rostrum and were soon joined by other other Black Democrats and other supporters. The Republican-led chamber called a recess, all GOP lawmakers left the floor, and the state Florida Channel stopped broadcasting the proceedings. “This is good trouble! Necessary trouble!” Nixon shouted, echoing a phrase used by the late civil rights activist and congressman John Lewis. The group sang “We Shall Overcome” and prayed. Some members went on Facebook to stream live feeds of the protest. Nixon said in a text message to the Associated Press that the lawmakers would not leave the floor unless they were physically removed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams’ gubernatorial campaign asked a federal judge Wednesday to shut down unlimited contributions to a committee controlled by Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. The filing is yet more litigation over the constitutionality of a 2021 Georgia law that allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits and coordinate spending with campaigns. The judge earlier denied a request by Abrams to start taking unlimited amounts before she clinches the Democratic nomination May 24. Kemp narrowly beat Abrams in the 2018 general election, and they would match up again if Kemp survives a Republican primary challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue and others. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Donors can give as much as they want, while they can’t directly give candidates for statewide office more than $7,600 for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. Opponents say the law unconstitutionally favors incumbents over challengers because they can raise limitless sums for years ahead of an election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Public school students must continue wearing masks in classrooms despite state officials lifting the same rules for airports and public transportation following Monday’s federal judge decision to remove mask requirements on U.S. flights. Masks are no longer required in Hawaii airports, on city buses or in handicapped vans, but all public students will be required to wear masks through the end of the school year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “I understand that there are different perspectives regarding the Hawaii State Department of Education’s indoor masking in schools,” interim Superintendent Keith Hayashi said in a letter to parents. “We will continue to implement universal indoor masking in schools.” Federal transportation officials announced Monday that they would no longer enforce mask rules after a U.S. judge’s decision to strike down the mandate on domestic flights. The four largest U.S. airlines almost immediately dropped their mask requirements, and Hawaiian Airlines announced late Monday that it would follow suit. “We ask for our guests’ patience and understanding as we update all our communications and announcements,” the airline said. “We advise travelers to stay informed and follow mask requirements that may remain in effect at their origin or arrival airports.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two men have been sentenced to jail time and banned from hunting for years after pleading guilty to poaching a grizzly bear near Yellowstone National Park. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said in a press release that Rex Baum, 79, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with the female grizzly’s death last year. He was ordered to serve 3 days in jail and was banned from hunting for a decade. Baum’s son, Jared Baum, of Ashton, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and banned from hunting for life after pleading guilty to a felony in connection with the incident. Fish and Game officers discovered the grizzly’s carcass April 9, 2021, after the bear’s radio tracking collar signaled it had died, the Idaho Statesman reports. X-rays of the bear showed she had been shot more than a dozen times. Conservation officers visited the bear’s den, discovering a dead male cub. The agency contacted the two men after sending a warrant to Google for records of electronic devices that had been in the area around the time of the grizzly’s death. Idaho grizzlies are federally protected. Last month, Gov. Brad Little joined Montana and Wyoming governors in petitioning for the bears to be removed from Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The city will have a starring role in the state’s latest marketing campaign, with the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Cozy Dog Drive-In, and other sites featured in the new promotion. Gov. J.B. Pritzker officially announced the new campaign, “Middle of Everything,” at a ceremony Monday at Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium. While the Windy City is spotlighted heavily, Springfield gets plenty of love as well, with sites related to the 16th president, such as Lincoln’s Home and Lincoln’s Tomb, promoted in addition to the museum and a statue of Lincoln sitting on a park bench outside the museum. Pritzker said the $30 million campaign would help to recover tourism dollars lost during the COVID-19 pandemic and put the state in a position to grow in the years to come. A series of TV ads will run with the campaign, directed by Illinois native Jane Lynch, famous for roles such as in the TV series “Glee” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” The Dolton-raised actor, a graduate of Illinois State University, narrates a quartet of 30-second ads that showcase a Lincoln impersonator at the Lincoln Home, a muscle car at the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices downtown, Lynch interviewing a family at the Cozy Dog and speaking with a ghost of Lincoln at “Ghosts of the Library” in the ALPLM, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Thomas McDermott Jr. released a new video ad Wednesday of him smoking marijuana in honor of 4/20, a cannabis-related celebration. McDermott, who will face Republican Sen. Todd Young on Nov. 8, has been vocal about his support for the legalization of marijuana, but the video of him lighting it up is a first. In the video the Hammond mayor posted on Twitter, McDermott lights a joint and smokes it in an Illinois backyard, where marijuana consumption has been legalized. He talks to an attorney, a physician, a criminal defense attorney, a professional distiller and another elected official about the benefits of legalizing weed. “Here’s the bottom line,” McDermott says in the video. “We need to legalize marijuana on the federal level. We need to also legalize cannabis in Indiana as well, so Hoosiers can get the health and economic benefits of cannabis.” The mayor admitted last year on his “Left of Center” podcast that he smoked marijuana at a recent Grateful Dead show at Wrigley Field. McDermott unveiled the ad the same day the Indiana Democratic Party launched a tour to push marijuana legalization. It started publicly advocating for the policy change in November, but with Republicans in control at the Statehouse, it went nowhere in the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: This year’s Major League Baseball Field of Dreams game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs will have an opening act. The Cedar Rapids Kernels and Quad Cities River Bandits will play a regular season minor league baseball game in the stadium located near the iconic diamond from the movie Aug. 9. That showdown is set to take place just two days before MLB’s second-straight visit to the famous farmland and in the same ballpark used last season by the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees. The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds will play on the same field Aug. 11. “I think it just adds to an entire week now up there,” said Kernels general manager Scott Wilson. “Instead of just one night even with the major league game, you’ve got Tuesday night with us. It gives the Field of Dreams some opportunity to do some things on Wednesday between us and have that game on Thursday.” It’s a marquee matchup of minor league teams have been rivals in the Midwest League for years. The River Bandits are the High-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. The Kernels are the High-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The two teams, who are are located in Eastern Iowa, will become the first two minor league teams to play on the field.\n\nKansas\n\nAtchison: Aviator Amelia Earhart vanished as she tried to fly around the world in 1937, along with navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra 10-E airplane. The centerpiece of the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum is Muriel – the world’s last remaining Lockheed Electra 10-E. Named after Earhart's younger sister, Grace Muriel Earhart Morrissey, Muriel is identical to the plane Earhart flew on her final flight around the world. That museum is in the works in Atchison, Earhart’s birthplace. Museum founder and president Karen Seaberg announced last week that supporters had already donated $10 million of the estimated $15 million needed to create the museum, including corporate powerhouses FedEx, Garmin and Lockheed Martin. The museum is expected to open next year, according to its website. Earhart, born in 1897 in Atchison, was a social worker in Boston in 1923 when she became the 16th woman in the U.S. to be issued a pilot’s license. She subsequently became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic and the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. She was also the first woman to fly nonstop across the U.S. She became a celebrity and drew attention by rejecting traditional women’s roles and speaking in support of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Earhart also created her own line of women’s clothing, featuring comfortable outfits designed for “active living.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that he will form an advisory team amid a broad review as he weighs whether to take executive action to legalize access to medical marijuana. Beshear said he instructed his legal team to analyze potential options for executive action to create a framework to make medical cannabis available for people suffering from specified ailments. The Democratic governor also made a direct appeal to Kentuckians to offer their views on the issue. “I want to be clear: I am for medical cannabis,” Beshear said at his weekly news conference. “I want it done in the right way. And we’re going to be looking at our legal options very closely. And at the same time, we want to hear from you.” The advisory team will travel the state to gather public input, and Kentuckians will be able to express their views directly to the governor’s office, he said. The expanded review reflects the governor’s growing frustration after the latest bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate during the legislative session that ended last week. Lawmakers failed to “get the job done,” with Kentucky falling behind the majority of states that make medical cannabis available as an alternative to opioid medications, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge and court-appointed monitors hired to oversee reform of the New Orleans Police Department said Wednesday that the long-troubled agency could reach full compliance this year after a nearly decade-old court-backed overhaul of its policies and practices. “I’m proud of how far NOPD has come,” U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan, who approved the agreement in 2013 a highly critical 2011 investigation and report by the U.S. Justice Department. Morgan tempered her praise with acknowledgment of continuing problems, including the short-handed department’s slowdown in recruiting and allegations of wrongdoing by officers who work private duty details arranged through the department. But the department has shown transparency in dealing with such setbacks, Morgan said. The reform agreement, embodied in a court document called a consent decree, was welcomed by department critics when it was negotiated during former Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s administration. They said it was needed for a department that had been plagued by recurring scandals involving corruption or questionable use of force for decades. But the consent decree had its critics as well, including police officer representatives who said it hampered police work.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed off on a $1.2 billion supplemental budget Wednesday that sends more than half the money to residents in the form of $850 relief checks. Backed by dozens of lawmakers and Cabinet members, the governor signed the bill into law in the State House Hall of Flags. “What this budget shows once again – through hard work and good faith negotiation – Democrats, Republicans and independents can come together to do what is right for Maine people. And that we can do so without rancor or bitter partisanship that has sometimes divided Augusta in the past,” she told the assembly. The swift action means the checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 Mainers as early as June. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the budget proposal in a show of bipartisanship. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers, taking a suggestion from Republicans as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. It was originally touted as pandemic relief but is now called inflationary relief. Mills’ opponent in the upcoming election, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, derided the relief checks as a “gimmick.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed measures into law Thursday aimed at increasing public safety, jobs, environmental stewardship and mental health resources. The Republican governor, who prioritized initiatives to support the police and fight crime this legislative session, signed legislation to increase transparency in the criminal justice system and to create a state gun analytics center to coordinate resources to screen and vet gun cases to improve the prosecution of gun crimes. “Violent crime continues to be Marylanders’ top priority, and today we’re signing our Judicial Transparency Act so that the public knows more about the sentences that are being handed down for violent criminals,” Hogan said. “We’re further expanding our warrant apprehension efforts and strengthening prosecutions on gun crimes.” Hogan opened his remarks before signing 103 bills with House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Pro Tem Melony Griffith by noting it was the first time two Black women were the presiding officers representing the Maryland House and Senate together at a bill signing. The criminal justice measures marked a compromise between the Republican governor and the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMartha’s Vineyard: A local family will go to court Friday over its continuing fight over a piece of land in Aquinnah that the Kennedy family donated to the Vineyard Conservation Society in 2013. Tanisha Gomes and her family say they are the rightful owners of that 5.7-acre property and are challenging the society’s motion for summary judgment, which asks a judge to throw out the case. In 2017, Gomes received a letter from Fidelity National Law Group, a firm that represents Vineyard Conservation Society Inc., to inform her and 19 members of her family about title problems with the land. The letter informed Gomes and her relatives that a lawsuit was filed with Dukes County Superior Court against the family, who are considered heirs of Louisa Pocknett. Pocknett, described in the complaint as the former owner of the property, died Aug. 29, 1874, and was a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. The family members were asked to sign an agreement to verify they had no right, title or interest in Lot 240, which was indicated on a plan entitled “Plan of Gay Head.” After further research, Gomes and her family found that Lot 240 remains in Pocknett’s name on the town of Aquinnah’s assessor’s website and objected to the lawsuit due to discrepancies surrounding incomplete deeds.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican state Sen. Lana Theis opened a session with an invocation by claiming children are being attacked by “forces” that want to indoctrinate them with ideas their parents do not support. Three Democrats walked out of last week’s meeting to protest her apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation and gender identity and critical race theory. Within days, one who tweeted criticism of the prayer was targeted by Theis in a fundraising email, calling Sen. Mallory McMorrow a liberal social media “troll” and accusing her of wanting to “groom” and “sexualize” kindergartners and teach “that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.” McMorrow responded Tuesday with a forceful, impassioned floor speech that resonated nationwide. “I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom” who wants “every kid to feel seen, heard and supported – not marginalized and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian,” she said. Theis, who declined to speak after the session, released a statement in which she did not apologize but again accused Democrats of trying to undermine parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education. McMorrow’s 5-minute speech found an engaged audience on social media, racking up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Mike Dando, a St. Cloud State University English professor, has helped to create a new superhero comic and is aiming to teach students in grades 5-12 literacy skills, critical thinking and self-reflection this summer through an often overlooked medium. Exploring concepts like Afrofuturism and the African diaspora, students can imagine new worlds by reading and analyzing the story of the first Black superhero, Lion Man. In 2018, after the highly successful “Black Panther” movie debuted, Dando worked with a group of artists and professors around the world to revisit Lion Man, the first Black superhero comic, written in 1947 by Black Philadelphia journalist Orrin Cromwell Evans. The original story follows Lion Man, a scientist turned superhero tasked by the United Nations to watch over a magical mountain full of uranium in Africa to prevent war. When All-Negro Comics Inc.’s paper supplier refused to help the company produce another book because its founders were Black, only one Lion Man issue was ever published – until now. Dando’s new, much longer Lion Man comic book follows the character’s journey of self-discovery and heroism as he works to save a group of other heroes trapped in monstrous bodies. He served as editor and project manager for the work written by John Jennings and illustrated by David Brame. Thanks to a grant from St. Cloud State, the team was able to make copies of the comic book – one of which is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – and Dando will work with a variety of after-school clubs this summer to talk about the narrative structure and themes of the book, as well as teach students how to make their own comics.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Volunteers on Thursday planted several types of grasses along a stretch of Mississippi Gulf Coast beach to help restore habitat for newly hatched Least Tern chicks. Audubon Delta, along with Harrison County Sand Beach Authority and Gulfport High School, partnered to install several species of beach grasses into a globally recognized conservation zone in Gulfport in order to stabilize the beach, encourage dune formation and provide coverage for the endangered birds. The area was destroyed after hurricanes Ida and Zeta and several tropical storms over the past two years, officials said. The project was made possible by a Caring for Our Coasts grant issued by Citgo and Restore America’s Estuaries.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City leaders on Thursday announced plans for a new institute designed to make the region a major player in geospatial technology. Andy Taylor, executive chairman of the rental car company Enterprise Holdings, is providing financing for the Taylor Geospatial Institute, along with eight St. Louis-area research institutions. The institute will provide funding for research and program development and expects to attract leading scientists to St. Louis, organizers said. Taylor said in a statement that he hopes the institute “will cement St. Louis as the world’s true center for geospatial excellence.” A news release says research and training will focus on topics such as food security, improving health care systems, and national security. Officials did not disclose how much money the Taylor family is investing, but the family has funded more than $1 billion in St. Louis civic initiatives and cultural institutions through the years.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers have rejected an attempt to call a special legislative session to investigate the state’s election processes amid continued false claims by ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was stolen. A poll of 149 lawmakers found just 44 approving a special session by Tuesday’s deadline, short of the 75 needed. The secretary of state’s tally showed 60 lawmakers rejected the special session, and another 45 didn’t return their ballots, which counts as a “no” vote. One legislative seat is vacant. Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers tried to reach an agreement to ask Gov. Greg Gianforte to call a special session to create new voting districts for the Public Service Commission before three federal judges had to decide how to even out the populations in the five districts. However, GOP leaders were unable to get a commitment from all Republicans to limit the special session to addressing just the voting districts. Gianforte said he would not call a special session without such an agreement. After the court set the PSC districts for the 2022 elections, 10 lawmakers asked for the poll on whether lawmakers wanted to hold a special session on election integrity.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Former U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson endorsed state Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks on Thursday in her campaign for the state’s 1st Congressional District. Pansing Brooks, a Democrat, is looking to replace former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who resigned after he was convicted on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal campaign contribution. Nelson, a Democrat, said Pansing Brooks has worked with both parties while in the Nebraska Legislature and passed more than 60 bills. Pansing Brooks will face state Sen. Mike Flood, a Republican, in a June 28 special election to determine who will serve the remainder of Fortenberry’s term in Congress. She’s also expected to face Flood again in November, assuming that they both win their parties’ May 10 primary nomination as expected. Nelson is the most recent Democrat to have served as Nebraska’s governor, with a tenure from 1991 to 1999. He was a U.S. senator from 2001 to 2013. Pansing Brooks has served in the Legislature since 2015 and is leaving office in January due to term limits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Most of the five leading Republican candidates for governor who gathered Wednesday for a campaign forum offered dire assessments of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, rising crime and struggling schools – and asked for votes for their visions to fix them. Several also blamed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, the consensus GOP front-runner, for skipping the event. “We want to have the best, well-run, state in the country,” said Guy Nohra, a Reno venture capitalist, drawing applause from among about 100 people at a Republican women’s club luncheon in Las Vegas. “But we don’t. We’re 50th in everything,” said Nora, who called his foray into politics the culmination of an American dream after his own teenage experience fighting a war in his home country, Lebanon, and his business ventures in the U.S. The event also featured North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, Gardnerville surgeon Fred Simon, former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller and firebrand northern Nevada lawyer Joey Gilbert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House approved a resolution Thursday in support of New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation presidential primary before advancing a bill opponents said would threaten it. The nonbinding resolution came a week after the Democratic National Committee approved a plan to revoke the guaranteed first-place spots in the presidential nominating calendar long held by the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Noting New Hampshire has withstood previous challenges, lawmakers affirmed their commitment to the tradition and said candidates are well-served by campaigning in a state with an engaged citizenry and “well-run, free and fair elections.” But a supporter of a bill to create a provisional ballot system later called the current system “laughable,” claiming it allows people to cast fraudulent ballots with virtually no consequences. Under current law, voters who arrive at the polls without the necessary identification fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days; those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. The votes themselves remain valid, but under a bill sent to the House Finance Committee on Thursday, the state would create a new type of “affidavit ballots” that would be thrown out if voters fail to follow up. Opponents called it an expensive and complicated solution to a problem that doesn’t exist and said creating a system that would delay the final results for more than a week would threaten the state’s ability to hold the first primary.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBloomfield: The flowers were finally on full display Thurday as recreational marijuana sales began in the Garden State. Michael Barrows wore his Grateful Dead T-shirt and Jerry Garcia face mask for opening day of legal cannabis sales and was one of dozens of people who lined up before dawn to join the celebratory scene. “It’s pretty amazing, exciting, and if I get pulled over on the way home, and I’m ever asked if I have any drugs in the car, now I’m allowed to say ‘only this,’ ” Barrows said, holding up the canister of marijuana flower he had just purchased. Possession of cannabis is legal now in New Jersey, though driving under the influence is still prohibited. Barrows, 60, joined a steady stream of other novelty-seekers, longtime marijuana users and medical patients at RISE in Bloomfield, near the state’s biggest city, Newark, and not far from New York City. With soul music blaring, free doughnuts in the parking lot, a steel drum and a balloon arch at the entrance, New Jersey’s cannabis kickoff for people 21 and older had the feel of a fair more than a store opening. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has long backed recreational marijuana legalization and signed the bill that set up the new marketplace kicking off at 13 existing medical marijuana facilities across the state, appeared at ZenLeaf in Elizabeth for its first day of recreational sales. The governor said he wouldn’t be trying any pot; earlier this week he said it’s not his “thing,” and he prefers scotch.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Habitat for about a million bats will be protected from human impacts through a deal between a nonprofit and the federal government. About 315,000 acres of southern New Mexico land owned by billionaire media tycoon Ted Turner were protected from development in a partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and New Mexico Land Conservancy. The deal saw a conservation easement added to Armendaris Ranch, owned by Turner, due to perceived cultural significance and biological diversity on the land in Sierra and Socorro counties. The ranch land supports more than 500 vertebrate species, according to a report from the Land Conservancy, including multiple listed for federal and state protections. It also contains the Fra Cristobal Mountain Range, home to 230 desert bighorn sheep, and lava fields that include the Jornada cave system that houses bats of multiple species. “This land is laden with important and unique natural and cultural resources, and the opportunity to permanently protect a property with conservation values of this magnitude was at the heart of our organization’s decision to tackle this landscape-scale project,” said Ron Troy, southern New Mexico program manager with the Land Conservancy.\n\nNew York\n\nOlive: As western regions contend with drier conditions, New York City is under fire for sometimes releasing hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from a key reservoir in the Catskill Mountains. The occasional releases, often around storms, have been used to manage water levels in the Ashokan Reservoir and to keep the water clear. But residents downstream say the periodic surges cause ecological harm along the lower Esopus Creek. They say the high flows churn up the water so much it turns the scenic Hudson River tributary the color of chocolate milk. “These people can afford to offer New York City cheap, clean, beautiful water by destroying ours,” said Michael Vallarella, who lives on the creek in Saugerties. Standing on his back deck recently, he swiped through pictures on his phone of the water looking like “Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory river.” The tensions between upstate residents and the city of 8.8 million people to the south touch on how the largest unfiltered water supply in the country will operate in an expected stormier future. Opponents pushing for changes to the water releases got a boost recently when state regulators told the city to take a deeper look at their effects. City officials say they’re trying to strike the difficult balance of responding to downstream concerns while delivering quality water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The fight over a downtown Confederate marker is not over, according to the attorney challenging the city’s removal of Vance Monument, and documents filed Wednesday attempt to take the issue to North Carolina’s highest court. Despite an April 5 ruling from the N.C. Court of Appeals in favor of the city, affirming a lower court judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing removal of the monument, the city finds itself again in limbo. Nearing midnight Wednesday, Edward Phillips, lawyer for the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops, which brought the challenge against the city, filed a petition for discretionary review with the N.C. Supreme Court. This document is a request for the Supreme Court to review the decision by the Court of Appeals. It does not ensure the high court will hear an appeal, said City Attorney Brad Branham. “I am not going to cede the point until I’m told there’s just no path forward,” Phillips said. The filings add to an already lengthy process to determine the fate of the obelisk that was built to honor racist Civil War-era Gov. Zebulon Vance. The 75-foot-tall granite Vance Monument stood in Pack Square Plaza in the heart of downtown Asheville. All but its base was taken down as of June 2021 after the City Council voted to remove it. The historical preservation group is seeking to stop and potentially reconstruct the monument to Vance.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that dismisses a lawsuit brought by the state and several western counties that could have resulted in the construction of additional roads in parts of the Badlands. The Badlands Conservation Alliance says the ruling protects some of the most pristine areas of the Badlands from traffic and potential oil development. “I think it’s a really serious win for the Badlands, for the long-term integrity of those areas that are still roadless and considered suitable for wilderness,” said Connie Triplett, president of the alliance. A three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s and counties’ claim is barred by a 12-year statute of limitations that was passed years ago. Their ruling upholds an earlier decision by U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Hovland, who dismissed the matter in 2017, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The case began a decade ago when Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie and Slope counties sued the federal government. The state followed with its own lawsuit, and the court consolidated the two cases. The plaintiffs sought to claim rights to section lines used in land surveying and mapping in the Little Missouri National Grassland and other areas that make up the Dakota Prairie Grasslands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A lawsuit has been filed targeting legal protections granted to health care providers that allow them to deny treatment they oppose on the basis of their conscience or religious beliefs. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on Wednesday sued the state over the measure known as the “conscience clause.” According to the law, a medical provider can be “excused from participating” whenever a treatment conflicts with a provider’s “moral, ethical, or religious beliefs or convictions.” Opponents of the law say it could limit abortions or other medical care. The city also argues the measure violates Ohio’s Constitution and the federal Affordable Care Act. If nurses employed by the city are opposed to a medical procedure, “they can refuse it, and we as a city can’t do anything about it,” Klein said. He also said insurance companies could refuse to pay for certain procedures, and “that obviously causes significant problems for our employees.” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine kept the language of the law in place when he signed the 2021 budget. DeWine said the provision merely sets into state law what’s already being practiced. In a statement, Attorney General Dave Yost called the lawsuit “meritless, anti-democracy and authoritarian.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Plans to fully legalize marijuana can proceed to the signature-gathering stage, the state Supreme Court ruled, paving the way for two more cannabis plans seeking voter approval. The high court’s ruling late Tuesday comes amid a marijuana boom in the Sooner State after voters in 2018 approved the most liberal medical marijuana program in the nation. Nearly 10% of Oklahoma’s 4 million residents have qualified for a medical-use card – by far the highest percentage in the country. Supporters of the two separate proposals still need to gather enough signatures to put the plans on the ballot for voters. The plans approved Tuesday, State Question 819 and a companion State Question 818, would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to protect the right of residents age 21 and older to use marijuana. It’s part of a nationwide push to legalize the recreational use of cannabis for adults, which 18 states and the District of Columbia have already approved. Because the two proposals seek to amend the constitution, supporters will have to gather more signatures, about 178,000 in 90 days, for them to qualify for the ballot. “Whether we’ll get on the November ballot this year remains to be seen,” said Jed Green, a longtime Oklahoma cannabis activist behind the plans. “We’re going to push, push and push to get it done.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Native American tribe in the state said it is assessing its legal options after learning the U.S. government plans to release water from a federally operated reservoir to downstream farmers along the Oregon-California border amid a historic drought. Even limited irrigation for the farmers who use Klamath River water on about 300 square miles of crops puts two critically endangered fish species in peril of extinction because the water withdrawals come at the height of spawning season, the Klamath Tribes said. Last year, critically endangered sucker fish central to the Klamath Tribes culture and religion didn’t have enough water to spawn, and thousands of downstream juvenile salmon died without reservoir releases to support the Klamath River’s health. The tribes said in a statement that the decision to release any water to about 1,000 farmers in the massive, federal agricultural project was “perhaps the saddest chapter yet in a long history of treaty violations” and placed the blame for the current water crisis on “120 years of ecosystem mismanagement at the hands of settler society.” The fish are important to the inland tribes’ cultural and religious practices and were once a dietary staple. The Klamath stopped fishing for the sucker fish in the 1980s as numbers dwindled. They now run a captive breeding program to ensure the species’ survival and note that no juvenile sucker fish have survived in the wild in recent years. “We have nothing left with which to ‘compromise,’ ” the Klamath Tribes said in a statement. “Global warming is certainly a global problem, but thus far its local consequences appear to be exacerbating existing and systematic inequalities between ourselves and the larger society.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Prosecutors said Thursday that they will not re-try a Philadelphia man whose 2012 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month, citing weak evidence and the involvement of a disgraced former detective now charged with sexually assaulting witnesses in other cases. Rafiq Dixon, 40, had been serving a life sentence in the 2011 fatal shooting of Joseph Pinkney. The 40-year-old was expected to be released from prison Thursday afternoon, hours after a Common Pleas Court judge granted the motion to withdraw charges, his attorney said. The initial case relied heavily on testimony from three witnesses who gave inconsistent accounts. All three were interviewed by former homicide detective Philip Nordo, who has been charged with various crimes including stalking, intimidating, and sexually assaulting male suspects and witnesses during his career. In June, a judge reversed the 2015 conviction of Arkel Garcia, who confessed to murder during an interrogation in which, his lawyer said, Nordo asked the teenager to view pornography with him. The ruling came after both sides presented evidence that Nordo had sexually groomed witnesses in the case and trial prosecutors had suppressed his misconduct. Garcia was also serving a life sentence.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic former state lawmaker David Segal has joined the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a fellow Democrat who’s retiring after more than two decades in office. Segal announced his decision Wednesday, saying that many voters are fed up with federal politics and that “government should be able to do more to address the concerns of our neighbors.” Segal served on the Providence City Council before winning a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He served for two terms, from 2007 to 2011. In 2010 he lost a bid for Congress and founded a national liberal advocacy organization known as Demand Progress. He’s the latest entry in a crowded Democratic field that also includes state Treasurer Seth Magaziner; Joy Fox, a former top aide to Langevin; Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau; Omar Bah, executive director of the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; and former political strategist Michael Neary. “We have the people power to reach the voters, we have the money to compete, and we have the urgent case to make that we deserve leaders who can bring people together and ensure their voices are heard,” Segal said in his campaign announcement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Wednesday issued a temporary stay blocking the state from carrying out what was set to be its first-ever firing squad execution. The order by the state Supreme Court puts on hold at least temporarily the planned April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, who drew the death sentence for the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg. The court said in issuing the temporary stay that it would release a more detailed order later. Attorneys for the 57-year-old inmate had sought a stay, citing pending litigation in another court challenging the constitutionality of South Carolina’s execution methods, which also include the electric chair. Moore’s lawyers also wanted time to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether Moore’s sentence was proportionate to his crime. It has been more than a decade since the last firing squad execution in the U.S. The state of Utah carried out all three such executions in the nation since 1976, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. The most recent was in 2010. The South Carolina Supreme Court on Wednesday also set a May 13 execution date for Brad Sigmon, 64, convicted in 2002 of the double murder of his ex-girlfriend’s parents in Greenville County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A leadership shake-up and shorter wait times for service are welcomed changes for disgruntled military veterans who say the federal health care system is failing them, but that’s still not enough to appease the dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as well as a handful of elected officials, who showed up at the South Dakota Veterans Council’s quarterly meeting Wednesday. Praises of this week’s removal of the now-former Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs director were tempered by caution for a need for more systematic improvements. “If you walked the halls on Tuesday, there were more smiles in the Sioux Falls VA Hospital than there have been in 14 months,” said Hawk Mayor, a Vietnam combat veteran, referring to the departure of now former Sioux Falls VA director Lisa Simoneau. “But we’ve been shut out.” Simoneau was removed from the position as of Monday after growing pressure for a regime change from both veterans, VA employees and South Dakota’s congressional delegation. Since at least October, members of the South Dakota Veterans Council have voiced concerns about a lack of responsiveness from Simoneau regarding what’s described as an inadequate level of care being provided to veterans entitled to medical services through the veterans’ health care system. Some employees at the VA have also blown the whistle in recent weeks on poor management practices and a hostile work environment under Simoneau.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state would become the latest to impose harsh penalties on doctors who violate new, strict regulations dictating the dispensing of abortion pills under a proposal headed to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. It’s part of a coordinated nationwide effort spearheaded by anti-abortion groups upset over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to remove a rule that required women to pick up the abortion medication in person. After Tennessee’s GOP-controlled House approved the measure last week, Senate Republicans on Thursday signed off on sending the proposal to the governor. Lee hasn’t publicly weighed in on the measure, but he has yet to veto a bill while in office and frequently stresses his opposition to abortion. According to the bill, delivery of abortion pills by mail would be outlawed, and anyone who wanted to use abortion pills would be required to visit a doctor in advance and then return to pick up the pills. The drugs may be dispensed only by qualified physicians – effectively barring pharmacists from doing so. Violators would face a Class E felony and up to a $50,000 fine. The in-person requirement had long been opposed by medical societies, including the American Medical Association, which said the restriction offers no clear benefit to patients.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A prominent conservative activist has been charged with unlawful restraint and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon over an October incident involving a contractor the activist hired, his attorneys said Wednesday. Jared Woodfill and Gary Polland, attorneys for Dr. Steven Hotze, said the Harris County District Attorney’s Office told them Wednesday that Hotze was indicted over allegations against a former police officer, Mark Aguirre, who worked for Hotze. Aguirre had been retained to pursue a voter fraud investigation on behalf of Houston-based Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization Hotze runs. Aguirre was charged Dec. 14 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after a man accused him of running him off the road and holding him at gunpoint in an effort to prove what authorities have called a bogus voter fraud scheme. Aguirre claimed an air conditioner repairman was the mastermind. He said the man’s truck was filled with fraudulent ballots when he ran his SUV into it Oct. 19, according to authorities. Aguirre told police he and some friends set up a “command post” at a Marriott hotel in suburban Houston that conducted 24-hour surveillance on the repairman for four days, according to a police affidavit.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Faced with continuing drought and one of the fastest-growing populations in the U.S., the Washington County Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to apply new water restrictions to every new residential and commercial development. The new rules won’t apply to any existing homes or commercial buildings, but they could hopefully provide a better balance between what water is available and the continued demand for new construction, said Adam Snow, a member of the three-member commission, which regulates buildings requirements for all of the unincorporated areas of the county. “We want to have beautiful communities and a beautiful place to live and maintain our quality of life,” Snow said. “We’re doing it as effectively and efficiently as possible with our water, which is a very sacred resource right now.” The changes will be written into Title 10, Chapter 27 of the county code. They will only apply to projects on unincorporated county land that still need approval from the county to go forward, although they resemble similar measures being passed by cities and towns in the area. Snow said about 5% of the county’s population lives on unincorporated land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Property owned by Vermont-recognized Native American tribes will be exempt from property taxes under a new law that takes effect in July. The legislation, signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, recognizes that Vermont lands “are the historic and current territories of the Western Abenaki people.” “I sign it out of respect for the heritage of our Native American communities and traditions,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature. “Further, the associated costs to the Education Fund and the General Fund borne by all Vermonters are forecast to be negligible.” To be exempt from the state and municipal property taxes, the property must be used for the purposes of the tribe and not leased or rented. Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation, has said the tax exemption allows the tribes, which rely on grants and donations, to be able to use those resources “to help uplift our people” with food security and other needs. The legislation states that “stewardship of these lands was removed from the Abenaki by European governments and settlers” and acknowledges “the Abenaki people as the traditional land caretakers of Ndakinna, which includes parts of Vermont, New England, and Quebec.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWestlake: Officials at Booker T. Washington National Monument are asking the public for help in unraveling one of its biggest mysteries. Hidden away in a section of the park just off its Jack O’ Lantern Trail rests a cemetery that predates much of the known history of the former plantation where Booker T. Washington was born a slave and later freed. The cemetery has few markings to provide context to who was buried there or when they were buried. “It’s definitely one of the biggest mysteries at the park,” said Tim Sims, senior park ranger. Archaeologist with New South Associates recently began taking a deeper look into the cemetery, commonly referred to as the Sparks Cemetery named after a person who once lived nearby. Some of the Black families who have lived near the cemetery include the Brown, Holland, Divers, Burroughs, Ferguson, Taylor, Green, Harris, English, Edwards, Starkey, Swain, Saunders, Childress and Dudley families. Sims said the names of the families were found looking through property deeds, slave records and federal census records. People with information on those possibly buried in the Sparks Cemetery are asked to contact Velma Fann, historian, at New South Associates at 770-498-4155, x126 or vfann@newsouthassoc.com.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously ruled that an Edmonds city ordinance requiring that guns be locked up and kept out of unauthorized hands is preempted by state law. The ruling affirmed a three-judge state of appeals ruling last year in the case sparked by a lawsuit filed by three residents against the city of Edmonds after it approved an ordinance in July 2018 requiring residents to lock up their guns or else face fines. “Under our system of divided government, many elected bodies hold legislative power, including elected city councils. These councils, however, must legislate within constitutional constraints,” Chief Justice Steven González wrote, joined by the eight other justices on the high court. “One of those constraints is that city ordinances must not ‘conflict with general laws’ that have been enacted by the people of our state by initiative or by our state legislature.” A statewide ballot measure that passed later that same year on gun safety doesn’t mandate that a firearm be stored in a particular way or place, but it created criminal penalties for when a gun isn’t properly stored and accessed by someone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm – such as a child – and used to injure or kill, displayed in public in an intimidating manner or used during a crime.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A health care system has partnered with a junior college on a program aimed at addressing the shortage of nurses in the state. Mon Health System and West Virginia Junior College signed a letter of intent to launch a nursing education program that will put students at the school on an accelerated path to becoming nurses, officials said during a signing ceremony Monday. Mon Health nurses will serve as faculty, and the students will have digital coursework as well as learning through work at the hospital – what Mon Health System President and CEO David Goldberg called patient-side, The Dominion Post reports. The program plans to open enrollment in September and start its first class next April. The collaboration, Goldberg said, will serve “to bring not only the best nurses to patient-side through Mon Health, but keep people in this community, grow our own, take care of our own neighbors, family members and friends, so we continue to be the best health care location in north-central West Virginia and improve our health care outcomes.” West Virginia Junior College CEO Chad Callen said nursing shortages are at near crisis levels in some areas of the state. “Such challenges require bold thinking and innovative, out-of-the-box approaches,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker in the state as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves snakes and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman’s reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman’s website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s senior population grew at the nation’s second-fastest rate in the second decade of the millennium, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Citing research from online resource hub AgingInPlace.org, the newspaper points to a 40% increase in the proportion of Wyoming residents who are 65 or older between 2010 and 2020, with the level sitting at 17.8% in the latest census. Only Alaska was found to have a faster-growing senior population when comparing U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten. But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn.

Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage?

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins.

Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca. Sample lyric: \"Not too many things can bend him out of shape/ His mama must have come from the Planet of the Apes.\"\n\n133. Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136.

After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death. It is now the second most-visited home in the U.S., after the White House.\n\n139.

The 34-hour siege ends when police storm the office and kill Goulet on Feb. 5, 1982.\n\n140.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983.

Memphis State University football coach Rex Dockery, 41, and three others — freshman defensive back Charles Greenhill, offensive coordinator Chris Faros and booster Glenn Jones — are killed Dec. 12, 1983, in a small plane crash while en route to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.\n\n145. Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181. His fur was brown and shaggy, his belly was round and saggy: A slobby Everybear, the original version of Grizz, the Memphis Grizzlies mascot, is retired for the current blue-furred Superbear when the team moves from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004.\n\n182. A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat. Reports of the marine mammal's meanderings transfixed Memphians for several days, but the docile creature eluded capture and came to a sad end: It was found dead in December in McKellar Lake.\n\n187. Farewell to the Ape Girl, water-skiing squirrels and a life-sized Dolly Parton sculpted from butter: The last Mid-South Fair at the old Fairgrounds is held in 2008.\n\n188.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

Paul and James McElwain are a DJ duo unofficially embraced by the right and seeking to infuse more fun to politics.\n\nThe two have been involved in DJ event production for around a decade under the name “Milk N Cooks.” Paul said they entered the politics afterparty production scene after noticing a “gaping hole” in fun parties and entertainment surrounding the often intense and contentious political realm.\n\nServers wore tank tops with “No tax on tips” printed across their chests, a Republican Party talking point earlier in the day. About 100 people crowded around the bar around 10 p.m.\n\nPaul said he hopes the event brings people together.\n\n\"We lean a certain way, but we're not explicit about that and it's just, hey, we're trying to put on a good event for people to want to hang out, have good time and socialize,” Paul said.\n\n— Claudia Levens and Kelly Meyerhofer\n\nMichigan Rep.

Van Orden said Vance's upbringing and commitment to serving voters who live in rural areas or below the poverty line will offer a balance to the Republican ticket, contrasting Trump's billionaire status.\n\n\"If you look at that, that's an expression of the American dream,\" he said. \"People are going to gravitate towards that.\"\n\n— Tamia Fowlkes\n\nLocal government leaders decry Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal government leaders from across the U.S. gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to highlight the importance of the level of government closest to the people.\n\n“America’s mayors are driving solutions at the local level,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who was joined by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Rancho Cordova, California, Mayor David Sander and New York City Council member Joseph Borelli.\n\nThe group said whether Trump or President Joe Biden wins a second White House term, local governments will need a strong partnership with the federal government to address challenges in communities.\n\nJohnson pointed to the federal pandemic aid that reached local governments through the American Rescue Plan Act, saying it helped prevent Milwaukee from becoming insolvent and gave Wisconsin’s largest city the time it needed to reach a funding agreement with the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nSander, who is also president of the National League of Cities, called the attempted assassination an “attempt to murder democracy.”\n\n“That violence is a reminder of the responsibilities we all have as leaders to create stronger communities and to act swiftly to disavow hate and violence wherever we find it,” he said. “It was a reminder quite frankly of what our fellow mayors and council members and aldermen have known for way too long: that hate and violence toward elected officials in our country has been rising and it must end.”\n\nLeaders, he said, must “model better ideals for our democracy.”\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nFire and medical personnel field heat exhaustion calls\n\nA man experiencing what a police officer said was heat exhaustion got help from Milwaukee police and medics around 5:40 p.m. near the corner of State and Water streets as vehicles entered the convention perimeter.\n\nTemperatures in Milwaukee reached the upper 80s Monday.

And voters need to know that they have a real choice.”\n\nBooker echoed that sentiment.\n\n“They don’t stand with the values of the majority of American people when it comes to things like health coverage, with reproductive rights,” he said. “So this is going to be a very clear choice.”\n\nThe senators also addressed the growing amount of political violence in America, which culminated in former president being shot Saturday.\n\n— Laura Schulte\n\nInterview with Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley\n\nChurch flies LGBTQ+ Pride flag as message of love\n\nJust a couple of blocks east of Fiserv Forum at Village Church, Pastor Donna Brown and congregants hung up an LGBTQ+ Pride flag outside the front of the unassuming building.\n\n“We’re called to be inclusive and loving,” Brown said. “Anybody is welcome in, even if they don’t agree with us.”\n\nShe and four members of the church were laying out food and drinks inside the building, preparing for the rescheduled gathering. It’s a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America denomination with a special designation to welcome LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nEarlier, she had placed a sign in large font on the front door reading “No Weapons Allowed.\"\n\n“We don’t feel violence is an answer,” Brown said. “More weapons cause more violence.”\n\nLifelong Milwaukeean and member of the church Bill Koehn, 73, said security and the events of the last 48 hours were the main topics of conversation at the church’s Sunday service.\n\n“The bottom line is we are all about spreading the message of love and we don’t discriminate,” Koehn said.\n\nGesturing to the flag, he said: “If somebody has an issue with this being displayed or the fact that there is a church right here, on whatever level, that’s why we have our doors open so we can sit down and have a dialogue like this and get the opinions from people.”\n\nWhile he lamented Milwaukee's failed DNC in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Koehn said he was “OK” with the convention being in Milwaukee, especially the economic benefits and how it highlights the city of Milwaukee “in a way that doesn’t happen very often.”\n\n— Vanessa Swales\n\nMan disrupting protesters arrested by Milwaukee police\n\nA 36-year-old man was arrested Monday afternoon after disrupting protesters during the end of a march at Red Arrow Park, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nAuthorities say the man took signs from protesters and attempted to knock over a booth, causing a disturbance to protesters who just finished a march that ended at the park, 920 N.

He’s also surveyed protests at previous RNC and DNC conventions in 2008 and 2016. In comparison to previous RNC protests, this year’s is less organized and smaller, Heaney said, possibly due to the recent assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n“It may make the protests smaller because people are nervous about political events. I would project marginally smaller and marginally more intense protests,” he said.\n\nSasmit Rahman, 22, and Emily Chu, 22, traveled to from Minneapolis to march on the RNC. Rahman said they are looking forward to the results of the survey specifically around race and gender of protesters. Chu is interested to learn how people’s emotions may push them to attend protests.\n\n“I think it’s interesting to see whether it’s fear or hope that motivates people more,” Chu said.\n\n— Gina Castro\n\nNorth Carolina delegate loves Trump’s VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina delegate Pauline Bruno gushed about Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.\n\n“We are so pleased,” she said in a seersucker blazer and Trump-printed shoes she bought on Etsy.\n\nBruno loved Vance’s focus on the Rust Belt in his bestseller \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that she read two years ago.\n\nMilwaukee has been “so welcoming,” she said.

He owns and operates The Sushi Pirate, a restaurant in downtown La Crosse.\n\nFor other convention-goers, it’s far from their first rodeo: Floyd Brown, a Phoenix resident, said he’s attended every RNC since 1984, save for the mostly virtual convention during the pandemic.\n\n“The party is more unified than I’ve seen in decades,” Brown said after the delegate roll call. “It’s more somber this year, but people are also very upbeat.”\n\nBrown, who is an invited guest at the convention, is also a political commentator and author of “Counterpunch,”a 2023 book advocating for peaceful resistance against leftist movements. He said he feels the Republican party has unified in the face of rising political division, especially given the assassination attempt on Trump just days before the convention.\n\nBrown is attending the RNC with his wife, Mary Beth, who said she was excited by Trump’s announcement of Vance as his running mate this afternoon.\n\n“I think he’s going to do an excellent job,” Mary Beth Brown said of Vance.\n\n— Maia Pandey\n\nBobby Flowers, florist at Marius Bell Floral & Design, arrived at the Milwaukee Public Market around 11 a.m., and as of 5:30 p.m. said he's never seen the market so empty on a Monday.\n\n\"It's been dead,\" he said. \"There's usually a lot of tourist traffic here on Mondays, and it's just been so quiet today. It feels so strange.\"\n\nAs of 6 p.m., only eight patrons were seated in the market's upstairs dining area with roughly 20 to 30 patrons shopping or dining on the main floor. Five open tables were available at St. Paul Fish Co.\n\nOutside at the St. Paul Palapa tiki bar, all bar stools were occupied.\n\n— Rachel Bernhard\n\nA photo posted on X shows British comedian and actor Russell Brand, a Trump supporter and conservative internet personality, walking around downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe post says he was seen taking photos with fans and police officers near the Baird Center.\n\nBrand is scheduled to perform at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts music recital hall, and at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield on Wednesday.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke Monday evening called the Coalition to March on the RNC protest “extremely smooth and safe.”\n\n“I was really pleased with everyone, I think globally,” said Goyke, who observed the march on the first day of the Republican National Convention. “We had protesters and counter protesters. Everyone that was here seemed well organized, there was communication, law enforcement were everywhere they needed to be, communicating with individuals.”\n\nHe said he and his staff would be out in the coming days as well to monitor areas people are expressing their First Amendment rights and how government responds if an incident does occur.\n\nHe also said he got to talk with the Columbus Police Department’s 13-member Police Dialogue Team that was also out at the protest.\n\nIt’ll be interesting, he said, to see whether Milwaukee pursues a similar team at its own police department.\n\n“It’s a special team with training and background to go into protests or potential civil unrest, these kind of emotion-filled environments, and I thought they did a great job today,” he said.\n\nCommunication ahead of time helped ensure everyone was on the same page, Goyke said.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nPopular Wisconsin beer sparks political discussion\n\nSpotted Cow, the beer from the New Glarus Brewing Company, prompted the start of a discussion about the beer and its place in Wisconsin culture and politics.\n\nPolitico correspondent Adam Wren reported that Sen.

Leinenkugel’s is the conservative one.”\n\nHowever, social users have also made their opinions on the beer and the senator’s criticism.\n\nJournalist Robert Evans said that Wisconsin should be proud of Spotted Cow.\n\n“My primary takeaway from the Milwaukee RNC: Spotted Cow is an excellent beer, shocked by how good it is,” Evans said in an X post.\n\nX user Josh Geise (@joshgeise) said, “Was at Kohler this weekend. Had my first Spotted Cow.

Storms was scheduled to speak at Haymarket Square at 4 p.m. but relocated because it was deserted.\n\nWhen the Republican Party finalized its platform this week, it did not include language calling for a national ban on abortion.\n\nThe platform stated: “We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those rights.”\n\nAccording to its website, Operation Save America argues a “biblical worldview must govern all areas of both our private and public lives.” It is known for displaying graphic images of aborted fetuses as part of its anti-abortion advocacy and has stated that women who have abortions should be subject to the death penalty. Storms is the son-in-law of anti-abortion extremist Matt Trewhella.\n\nStorms was accompanied by several of his teenage children, who held large banners with anti-abortion imagery and quotes from the Bible.\n\n— Alex Groth and Cleo Krejci\n\nAttendee mixes RNC with her bachelorette party\n\nTemperatures have remained steadily in the high 80s across Milwaukee’s downtown.\n\nAnd as the afternoon has chugged along, Milwaukee’s Deer District has started to fill out with delegates, guests and volunteers spilling out from Fiserv Forum, seeking out cooling refreshments at local establishments like freshly opened New Fashioned, and its veteran neighbors, The DW Pub and The Mecca.\n\nConservative nonprofit Turning Point Action blasted out from speakers, ringing loudly throughout the plaza, discussing the recent pick of J.D.

We’re looking for people who can come in and identify with voters quickly,” Schimming said. “And he can do that.\"\n\n“That’s why it makes a difference,” Schimming added. “He can roll into a state like Wisconsin and immediately click. So anytime he wants to come to Wisconsin, I will put him in the car and personally drive him around.”\n\nAsked about Vance’s opposition to abortion, Schimming said Trump is the candidate “driving the issues and driving where people are.”\n\n“Donald Trump has not been laid back about saying, ‘Look, I’m not signing a national abortion ban,” Schimming said.\n\n— Lawrence Andrea\n\nWarm weather cools off sales for Convention Fest\n\nWalking outside in near 90 degree weather isn't an ideal shopping environment, but that was the case for the first day of Convention Fest.\n\nMonday, dozens of vendors showed off their products or services to credentialed delegates, media and other officials.\n\nMadan Raj, founder and president of Bobbletopia, started his company in Omaha, Nebraska, four years ago and quickly moved to Milwaukee.\n\nRaj had several versions of Trump in presidential form, but also as William Wallace from the movie \"Braveheart,\" and the Trumpinator, inspired by the \"Terminator.\"\n\n“People have taken pictures of the Trump bobbleheads,” Raj said, adding he’s had a few sales but many people have opted to buy items later in the week, so they don’t have to carry it as long.\n\nRaj said he's been working with the Committee on Arrangements for the Republican National Committee to register for the event and drop off his inventory.\n\n“They have great staff behind the scenes who take care of all of that. They set up the tent, the tables were provided. All I had to really take care of was inventory, which I brought in,” Raj said. “We had to set up Thursday and Friday.

Scott Walker and others.\n\nRipon’s Little White Schoolhouse is yet more proof that there is indeed always a Wisconsin connection.\n\n— Mary Spicuzza\n\nStreet vendor selling bloody Trump photo and pins for $5 each\n\nA T-shirt vendor is selling Trump merchandise, including a photo and pin of Donald Trump after he survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFor delegates and credentialed guests looking to get their hands on the golden Trump sneakers for $600, 365 Campaign is selling two pairs outside the Baird Center, sizes 6.5 and 7.5, for $600 each.\n\n“They’re very hard to come by,” manager Anthony Montgomery said. “They sell out quick.”\n\nMontgomery has a pair of his own.\n\n“I just wanted to see what it felt like to walk like President Trump,” Montgomery said. “This is the closest thing to it.”\n\nBefore coming to Milwaukee, Montgomery said the company was selling merchandise in Pennsylvania when Trump was nearly killed by an assassin.\n\n“It felt like a regular rally,” Montgomery said. “President Trump showed up, and I call it the seven-minute speech because that’s literally all he really had before they tried to take his life.”\n\nMontgomery said the shots sounded like fireworks but when he saw people running, that’s when he knew something serious happened.\n\n“I felt disrespected in a sense,” Montgomery said. “I felt like, 'How could they let something like this happen?'”Montgomery said he tried to keep his composure and help out people where they needed it.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nTensions rise between RNC protesters, anti-abortion group at Red Arrow Park\n\nProgressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, an anti-abortion group, is demonstrating in Red Arrow Park, where protesters from the Coalition to March on the RNC are resting after their march.\n\nTensions are high between the anti-abortion group and those who disagree with them. But Coalition security guards formed a barrier around the group as they laid on the ground to demonstrate.\n\nThe group staged a “wedding” between the “abortion industry” and the Republican Party. A woman in white dress spattered with fake blood “married” a man wearing a pool noodle on his nose to represent an elephant trunk.\n\nA person was shouting through a bullhorn at close range to the group, and members of the group shouted back. One member activated a siren sound on his bullhorn.\n\nThis all occurred as speakers affiliated with the Coalition held their own rally feet away on the slab of concrete that in the winter serves as an ice rink.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBiden-Harris campaign criticizes Trump VP pick\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon criticized Trump’s selection of J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday afternoon.\n\n“Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate because Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,” Dillon said in a statement.\n\nShe also condemned Vance’s stances on abortion, tax cuts and certification of the 2020 presidential election. Vance is staunchly against abortion but told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he supports access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe statement said the Biden-Harris ticket is “focused on uniting the country, creating opportunity for everyone and lowering costs” while the Trump-Vance ticket’s “harmful agenda will take away Americans’ rights, hurt the middle class, and make life more expensive — all while benefiting the ultra-rich and greedy corporations.”\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler in a Monday statement said, “The stakes of this election just got impossibly higher” as a result of Trump’s selection of Vance as his running mate.\n\n“Should Donald Trump win another term in the White House, there’s no question that J.D. Vance would put loyalty to Trump and the GOP’s extreme agenda over the country,” Wikler said. “In election after election, we’ve seen Wisconsinites reject the extreme, anti-freedom Trump-Vance agenda — and they’ll do it again this November.”\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nTrump is officially nominated for president\n\nIt's official: Trump was officially nominated for president during the delegate roll call at the RNC Monday afternoon.\n\nEric Trump, Donald Trump's son, delivered the delegates that formally put the former president over the top, USA TODAY reported.\n\n“On behalf of our entire family and on behalf of the 125 delegates in the unbelievable state of Florida, we hereby nominate every single one of them for the greatest president that’s ever lived, and that’s Donald J. Trump, hereby declaring him the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America,” he said.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump has his VP pick: Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance\n\nA little over an hour before his vice presidential choice was set to be revealed, Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate.\n\nVance will be \"strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond,\" Trump wrote.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC passes Fiserv Forum\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 passed the northern end of its march route a block from Fiserv Forum early Monday afternoon, crossing the Juneau Avenue bridge about 1:20 p.m.\n\nDespite its size, the group’s chants were largely inaudible to a reporter on the Deer District plaza, where music was playing and at least one interview was taking place over a loud speaker at one point.\n\nThe group stopped for a few minutes outside the entrance to the credentials-only “hard” security zone at North King Drive and West Highland Avenue. While they were there, their shouts mingled with music on the southeast end of the plaza.\n\nThe group had said its primary goal was to be within “sight and sound” of Fiserv Forum, and its route went right up against the fence that delineates the credentials-only “hard” zone from the security “footprint” where members of the public are able to enter.\n\nIts route took the group closer to Fiserv Forum than the city-designated demonstration area at Haymarket Square Park a bit farther north.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nParental rights, gender ideology take center stage in Heritage Foundation Policy Fest afternoon session\n\nHeritage Foundation researchers promoted traditional family values and bashed gender ideology during the afternoon panel of “Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future.”\n\nHeritage Foundation panelists Vice President of Domestic Policy Roger Severino, Senior Legal Fellow Sarah Parshall Perry, Senior Research Associate for the Tech Policy Center Daniel Cochrane criticized the Biden administration's handling of Title IX and children's social media usage in a panel moderated by conservative personality Liz Wheeler in the Bradley Symphony Center.\n\n“We have to take back as parents our God-given right to parent our children, even when it's tough,” Perry said.\n\nBiden, in one of his first executive actions , expanded federal anti-discrimination statutes that cover sex discrimination in regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, including for transgender individuals.\n\nPerry said the first thing she’d like to see Trump do in office is revoke “all guidance” on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n“From that first pebble, we see an avalanche of gender identity and orthodoxy in every system in America,” Perry said. “That is the primary responsibility, I think, of the next administration is to make sure that they don't sacrifice children on the altar of woke progressivism.”\n\nCochrane said gender ideology is spreading on platforms like Tik Tok. Panelists criticized youth access to inappropriate social media content and pornography. Cochran said sites like Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube should enact age-verification requirements.\n\nPerry also said she wants Biden’s timeline on Title IX to remove expansions on gender ideology rescinded. She blamed teachers’ unions for “outsized influence” over educational policy agenda items like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ curriculum and hosting “drag queens for story hours.”\n\nLGBTQ+ experts say the Biden administration’s expansion of LGBTQ+ protections and gender affirming care has helped combat harassment and discrimination. His policies have earned him the endorsement of LGBTQ+ advocacy groups like the Human Rights Campaign.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nCombating deep fakes in politics requires quick action but not over-reacting\n\nThe challenges posed by deep fakes in election campaigns are global, but on Monday, Microsoft Corp. addressed them as part of the RNC.\n\nDeep fakes are images, videos or audio recordings convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say. One example in the presidential campaign was a fake voice message claiming to be President Joe Biden urging New Hampshire voters not to take part in the primary election.\n\nMonday at noon, as part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft offered free training in identifying and addressing deep fakes, especially in political campaigns.\n\n“We’re very concerned about what the next few months look like leading into the U.S. election,” Ginny Badanes, general manager of Democracy Forward said in a Journal Sentinel interview.\n\n“I would say anywhere a political leader is talking publicly and being recorded, there’s a risk of that recording being manipulated to make it look like they said something at that event they didn’t say,” she added.\n\nA poorly made deep fake may be easy to identify. Voices that sound robotic, or unnatural speech patterns, are signs. Strange eye movements and a lack of blinking are other indicators. But detection is more difficult in a professionally made deep fake, and some of the most convincing are in local elections, according to Microsoft.\n\nA quick response, pointing people to the correct information, is important when a political campaign has been attacked with a deep fake or other type of false narrative.\n\nHere are some tips from Microsoft:\n\nInitiate an immediate response, based on factual data, that dismantles the falsehoods without amplifying them.\n\nTo start, evaluate the content’s potential impact. While a campaign may dislike AI-generated parodies of their candidate, an aggressive response risks being seen as humorless or suppressing free speech.\n\nFor content not warranting a serious response, options include ignoring it while monitoring for escalation or responding in a lighthearted manner, which can turn a negative into a positive. But if the content crosses ethical or legal boundaries, swift and unified action is necessary to contain its spread and control the narrative.\n\nBy promptly addressing false claims, you establish your version of events as the initial narrative, potentially inoculating audiences against subsequent misinformation.\n\nIf it’s a deep-fake video of a candidate, typically there’s a genuine video on which the fake was based. “That is one of the best antidotes, to get that out publicly, and say it’s the real video,” Badanes said.\n\nWhen deep fakes come with a high probability of losing votes, options include calling a press conference, issuing a public statement, or asking for a retraction. When there's a medium risk, options include activating supporter networks to push back, and considering a public statement. Low risk: Do nothing, so as not to amplify the falsehoods.\n\nHere’s a Microsoft quiz to test your abilities: Real Or Not (realornotquiz.com)\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nSevere thunderstorms expected for Milwaukee area in late afternoon and evening\n\nThe National Weather Service says more severe thunderstorms will move into the Milwaukee area late this afternoon and into the evening, peaking between 6 and 10 p.m.\n\nSevere winds, heavy rain and hail are the main threats, though Milwaukee County has a 2-4% chance for tornadoes. Storms are expected to be stronger along Wisconsin's border with Illinois.\n\nThe outdoor Convention Fest is scheduled to end at 5:30 p.m., and the evening official session inside Fiserv Forum runs from 5:45 p.m. until 10 p.m. That means delegates and media are likely to be indoors when severe weather comes through.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nRNC uses influencers to reach young voters\n\nThe RNC is using a new method to reach youth voters this week — more than 70 influencers. Youth Advisory Council Co-Chairs Brilyn Hollyhand, 18, and CJ Pearson, 21, lead the effort.\n\n“Young people don't trust billboards, they don't trust pamphlets, they don't trust direct mail, they don’t trust TV ads. They trust people,” Pearson said. “If we can mobilize influencers to fight for America, to come to our side, we can mobilize legions of young people as well.”\n\nAmong them are former Miss Universe judge and social media personality Emily Austin, Mikel Simmons of Bravo’s “Southern Hospitality” and Xaviaer DuRousseau, a creator with conservative organization PragerU.\n\nDuRousseau said influencers help bridge the trust gap between candidates and voters.\n\n“We are able to make the information palatable,” DuRousseau said. “We've gone through all the fluff, we've seen the details. Now, here is a summarized version from me, an influencer, someone that you trust.”\n\nThe Democratic National Convention Committee last month announced similar plans to five influencers access credentials in Chicago.\n\n— Rachel Hale\n\nAnti-abortion protesters rally in Haymarket Square\n\nAbout 50 anti-abortion protesters rallied at Haymarket Square Park around noon.\n\nAmong them was Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director. He said the initial goal was to encourage the Republican Party to strengthen their stance on abortion.\n\nBut after the RNC platform committee announced a softened stance on abortion, Sande turned from “frustrated” to “angry.”\n\n“The national Republican Party, the RNC and the president ought not to take the pro-life base for granted,” he said.\n\nHe said some who find the GOP abortion stance objectionable may stay home from the polls. Others will vote but will avoid enthusiastically door-knocking and other get-out-the-vote efforts, he said.\n\nHe said even if Trump were elected, it would be difficult to pass the kind of anti-abortion legislation he wants — such as a ban at conception or “fetal personhood” protections.\n\nFetal personhood would grant embryos and fetuses legal and constitutional protections that are equivalent to the person who's carrying them at every stage of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts have said any recognition of fetal personhood could have ripple effects far beyond a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions, potentially outlawing in vitro fertilization, embryonic stem cell research and some forms of birth control.\n\n“This is really taking the air out of the tires,” Sande said. “Literally and emotionally, it’s deflating to the base.”\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nCheese curd vendor at Convention Fest brought over 360 pounds of cheese\n\nThere's one vendor at Convention Fest that will undoubtedly be popular: Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds, owned and operated by David and Sanita Hofer. They've been in business for 16 years, working about 60 fairs and festivals in the Milwaukee area each season.\n\n\"This is not our first rodeo,\" David Hofer said about introducing out-of-state visitors to cheese curds. He has a sign set up next to the tent that explains the process of making cheese curds.\n\nHofer likes fried and raw cheese curds equally, but \"every time I think I'm getting sick of eating fried curds, I find myself still eating fried curds.\"\n\nHofer first learned about Convention Fest by reading about it in the paper. They went to a trade show, and convention organizers asked them a few months ago if they'd be interested in being a vendor.\n\nHofer, who was working the booth Monday afternoon with his two daughters, was getting customers even before Convention Fest officially started at 2 p.m. And they expected to keep selling even after the event wraps up at 5:30 p.m.\n\nHe found a calculator and estimated he brought 360 pounds of cheese for the curds to Convention Fest, plus 60 pounds of sliced cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches. Those cheeses come from Ellsworth and Plymouth, Wisconsin.\n\n\"I'm just hoping that we can represent the great state of Wisconsin with high-quality food,\" Hofer said.\n\nThere were plenty more Wisconsin vendors outside, including a beef stick stand. Drink Wisconsinbly also had tents and displayed not-so-political signs, such as \"I support fish frys,\" \"Pro-beers & bratwursts\" and \"Vote yes: Brandy old fashioneds.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee City Attorney Evan Goyke observes march\n\nCity Attorney Evan Goyke and former deputy city attorney Adam Stephens, who's working for the city this week as special counsel, observe the march from the front.\n\nGoyke declined to answer questions. He previously told the Journal Sentinel that he and Stephens would be observing protest activity around the RNC throughout the week.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been a large law enforcement presence around the march. A unit of officers on bicycles were seen staying a couple blocks away from the demonstration.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman has said he wants the department to be largely \"invisible\" when it comes to policing mass demonstrations during the RNC.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC begins, route to go through downtown Milwaukee\n\nHundreds of people started marching at noon Monday.\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC has a planned route of heading south on Water Street, across the Milwaukee River on Wells Street, before marching south on Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe group will then cross the river again and march north on Water Street to West Juneau Avenue, then south on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive before crossing the river again at West State Street.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nEvent staff near Haymarket Square are trained in de-escalation\n\nThe first two groups scheduled to speak at the Haymarket Square Park protest zone were no-shows.\n\nThat's according to Ashanti Hamilton, director of the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety (formerly the Office of Violence Prevention). He was at the zone to coordinate the speaker's platform and a group of event security staff in orange shirts.\n\nMost of the staff were community organizers trained in de-escalation and mediation tactics, Hamilton said.\n\n\"These are the most experienced folks that we have in crowd control,\" he said.\n\nFrom 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 15 speakers were scheduled to take to the platform, he said. Because the park was nearly empty, at least one group of protesters stopped by, then promptly left, Hamilton said.\n\nHe said the Trump assassination attempt changed the potential protest landscape.\n\n\"I'm just hoping, now that we have heightened tensions, that those things don't boil over into any of the demonstration activities,\" he said.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\nBay View restaurant to donate portion of sales to progressive organizations this week\n\nBay View restaurant Heirloom MKE, 2378 S.

About a handful of security staff wearing bright orange T-shirts are scattered throughout the area.\n\nAt around 11:40 a.m., three people at the square's pavilion briefly read testimonies from both local and national victims of gun violence, attracting one spectator.\n\n— Quinn Clark\n\nRipon's Little White Schoolhouse replica at RNC built by high schoolers\n\nA replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, is on display at the RNC's Convention Fest outside the Baird Center and Panther Arena.\n\nA one-third scale replica of the schoolhouse, constructed by Ripon High School students for parades and city events, will be on display at the RNC.\n\nThe full-size schoolhouse was Ripon's first public school, built in 1853, and is now more popularly known as the Little White School House, the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n\"We are so excited to have a way to showcase the incredible history that took place here in Ripon 170 years ago,\" Ripon Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mandy Kimes told the Fond du Lac Reporter. \"This is Ripon’s unique history and contribution to the development of our nation.\"\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nMilwaukee firefighter staffing double for RNC, union president says\n\nThe Milwaukee Fire Department is staffing about double its normal number of workers for the RNC.\n\nEric Daun, the president of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association, said that, on an average day, there are about 200 firefighters staffed around the city, but there’s “well over 200” additional staff for the convention.\n\n“I would say the members are being taxed to the max of their capacity,” Daun said. “We’re doing it to the best of their ability. I’ll say that.”\n\nHe said the department is getting help from suburban Milwaukee County departments. However, unlike with the police, there’s no out-of-state help.\n\n“Stress is at a higher level, but it is what it is. It’s to be expected,” Daun said.\n\nMilwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said the department had responded to a handful of minor incidents Monday morning. Overall, he said the day was going well.\n\n\"We got a lot of the kinks out on Sunday,\" he said. \"We're feeling OK with things out here.\"\n\n— David Clarey\n\nAbout 500 people gather for Coalition the March on the RNC rally at Red Arrow Park before march\n\nWith a rally underway ahead of the noon march by the Coalition the March on the RNC, a crowd of about 500 has gathered at Red Arrow, so far smaller than what organizers said they anticipated, about 5,000.\n\nAttendees have come from across the country to bring attention to a range of issues.\n\nCharlie Berg came from Minneapolis with the Climate Justice Committee. He said the Democratic and Republican parties have both failed to address climate change.\n\n“We need a platform and policy that is actually going to address climate change and we can’t do that so long as we have U.S. militarism, so long as we have reliance on fossil fuels, and so long as those corrupt parties are in power,” Berg said.\n\nBadger Van Grey, who is hosting a sign-making station, said the most common signs have included a focus on immigrant rights, LGBTQ rights, “We can no longer afford the rich” and “Free Palestine.”\n\nA handful of counter-protesters are at Red Arrow, deriding LBGTQ+ people and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA speaker with the group said he was from Indiana and identified himself only as Jim with Street Preachers. The man protested outside the 2016 RNC in Cleveland and has appeared on college campuses for many years.\n\nSome march attendees stood around the small group to film them but there were few interactions.\n\n— Rory Linnane\n\nJournal Sentinel's JR Radcliffe, Kristin Brey preview RNC in Milwaukee\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC protesters speak about Gaza, abortion rights\n\nAs hundreds gathered in Red Arrow Park Monday, Kobi Guillory, a Chicago teacher and central committee member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization, kicked off the press conference with a focus on Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Our government, in a bipartisan initiative, is committing genocide in Palestine with our tax dollars and reinforcing daily militarism,” Guillory said.\n\nAhead of the march, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said he expected the top issues for marchers would be abortion rights and standing with Palestinian people.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in a cross-border raid into southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael has retaliated with an intense military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, including women and children, medical authorities in Gaza have said.\n\nSeveral people told the Journal Sentinel they had come from Atlanta and Minnesota with Gaza top of mind.\n\nVictoria Hinckley, who said she was expelled from the University of South Florida for her involvement in a Palestinian-solidarity encampment there, attended the march with others from Students for a Democratic Society. Hinckley’s remarks Monday focused on abortion.\n\n“These attacks on reproductive freedom and abortion access are harshly felt in the South, especially in states like Florida and Texas with the emergence of anti-abortion bills banning abortion within the first few weeks of pregnancy,” she said.\n\n— Rory Linnane and Ashley Luthern\n\nMilwaukee 70-something couple comes to march against RNC\n\nBill Nantell and girlfriend Kathleen Joynt, both in their mid-70s who live near downtown Milwaukee, said they came to Red Arrow Park Monday to march against Republican policies on abortion, racism and senior benefits.\n\n\"I have voted for both Democrats and Republicans,\" Nantell said. \"This is not a Republican Party I am familiar with at all.\"\n\nNantell said he would like President Joe Biden to step aside for a younger candidate. But he will vote for him if Biden stays in.\n\n— John Diedrich\n\nStreet evangelists among the few at Haymarket Square Park\n\nA handful of street evangelists stood in a strip of shade on Haymarket Square Park, at North King Drive and West McKinley Avenue, holding signs with Bible verses.\n\nOne man with a microphone was preaching to a near-empty park.\n\nWarren Marquardt of Polk City, Florida, affiliated with Calvary Chapel, said he attends four or five public events a year to spread his message. He recognized the other preachers as regulars at big events.\n\n“There’s no politician that’s going to come on the scene and make it all right,” he said.\n\nStirling Long of Dawsonville, Georgia, affiliated with Providence Bible Church, a Reformed Baptist church, held a sign that read, “Are you going to Heaven? Free test.”\n\nAsked about the Republican Party’s softer abortion stance in its RNC platform, Long said he would not “vote for baby killers.”\n\n“They’re doing it for votes,” he said. “This is a game.”\n\nMarquardt also distanced himself from the GOP stance on abortion, saying, “God will do what God wants to do,” no matter the president in office.\n\nElsewhere along the security perimeter, streets were quiet. Event security staff in orange T-shirts milled around chatting. Police boats trawled the river.\n\n— Sophie Carson and Kathryn Muchnick\n\n'Reagan' movie posters showing up around RNC security perimeter\n\nPosters for an upcoming movie on President Ronald Reagan have popped up around the security perimeter in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Reagan\" stars Dennis Quaid and is scheduled to be released Aug. 30.\n\nThe RNC is also screening \"Reagan\" all day every day in the Regency Ballroom at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center for convention-goers.\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nConvention Fest sets up outside Panther Arena\n\nMid-Monday morning, white vendor tents were going up between the Baird Center and Panther Arena for Convention Fest, where those with credentials can experience local food and products.\n\nAmong the 100 local businesses participating in Convention Fest are Immy's African Cuisine and Scrima's Pizza. A Wisconsin cheese curds tent was in a prime location.\n\nIn the center of the road stood a replica of the Little White Schoolhouse from Ripon, Wisconsin, considered to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nTrump expected to announce his VP pick Monday afternoon\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier says Trump confirmed to him he’ll announce his running mate Monday.\n\nSources said the schedule calls for a vice presidential nomination shortly after 3:30 p.m., local time; Trump may make an announcement before then.\n\nTop names for the spot include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. But it’s not out of the question that Trump will make a more surprising pick.\n\nTrump had previously hinted he would announce his VP at the RNC, though that announcement typically came a few days before the convention in campaigns.\n\n— Hope Karnopp and USA TODAY's David Jackson\n\nArtists stage live climate change installation next to RNC security perimeter\n\nA team of actors and artists from Climate Power, a strategic communications organization that seeks to educate Americans on climate change, debuted a public art installation in the windows of the Germania Building, 135 W. Wells St., Monday morning. It’s located just outside the RNC's hard security perimeter.\n\nThe exhibit features five street-facing window displays depicting life-sized scenes of people affected by extreme weather situations, including excessive heat and flooding. Actors will bring to life the experiences of real extreme weather survivors who Climate Power and its partner artists have interviewed.\n\nNew York-based artist Annie Saunders said the installation is inspired by museum dioramas.\n\n“The aesthetic of a diorama is recognizable; it’s usually for history, it’s for prehistory, it’s for things that were frozen in time and are not happening anymore ...,” she said. “So, using that aesthetic to represent something that is happening but is being willfully ignored is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThe first window of the exhibit depicts a child’s playroom affected by extreme heat. A small plastic chair is melting, crayon wax is pooling on the table, construction paper pinned to the wall is fading, and the wallpaper is curling at the edges. An actor tries frantically to start an air conditioner.\n\nAnother window shows men in suits sitting around an office table for a business meeting with their heads literally stuck in a pile of sand in the middle of the table. File cabinets in the hallway leading to the meeting room are strewn about and black tar leaks out of them.\n\nSaunders said this represents politicians and officials who “have their heads in the sand” when it comes to the effects of climate change and choose to accept donations from oil and gas companies.\n\n“The problem with climate change is it’s so conceptual, and the language is so saturated ...,” Saunders said. “It’s being communicated with words, which are fundamentally abstract objects, and you have to hear the word and then have a visual or an emotional response.”\n\nDue to the installation’s proximity to the RNC, Saunders said Climate Power hopes to send a message to elected officials and people in power. She hopes the images stick with officials and help them realize that they too could be the victims of extreme weather.\n\n“Extreme heat and these issues do not discriminate on the basis of wealth and power,” Saunders said. “It’s coming for everyone.”\n\nSaunders and the Climate Power team have been working on the installation for over two months and have been setting it up on the Germania Building’s first floor for five days. Passersby will be able to see it through the windows all day Monday and until about noon Tuesday.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nHundreds already gathering at Red Arrow Park for march on RNC\n\nOrganizers with the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 are setting up Monday morning at Red Arrow Park, where they plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. and rally at 11 a.m. before marching in protest outside the RNC.\n\nSeveral hundred people already had gathered at the park by 10 a.m. and the event is expected to draw more than 5,000 people.\n\nOrganizers plan to march within a block of the convention’s main site, Fiserv Forum. They have remained committed to the plan despite heightened anxiety about security in the city after the apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nThe coalition plans to avoid the credentials-only “hard” security zone around the RNC but plans to enter the “soft” security zone. While the city has a sanctioned march route in the soft zone, the group plans to take its own route to get closer to Fiserv.\n\nOn Friday, Coalition Co-Chair Omar Flores said the group had a \"handshake agreement\" with city officials that the group would be allowed to use its own route. City officials didn’t confirm such an agreement but confirmed they were working with the group to ensure marchers could safely exercise their rights.\n\nThe “soft” security zone has special rules under the city’s extraordinary event ordinance, including a ban on certain items like non-plastic water bottles, umbrellas with a metal tip, bike locks, and bags larger than 18-by-13-by-7 inches.\n\nThe Coalition consists of local and national organizations, including the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Anti-War Committee.\n\nWhile the groups' individual missions vary, the Coalition's shared priorities include fighting for reproductive rights, standing with Palestinians and defending the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ people. Many organizers are also unsatisfied with the Democratic Party and plan to protest the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\n— Rory Linnane and John Diedrich\n\nMajor Goolsby's teams with Broken Bat Brewing to release Screamin' Eagle Lager\n\nIf there's a official beer of the RNC, it might be at Major Goolsby's.\n\nThe well-known sports bar, just on the outside of the convention hard security zone, partnered with Broken Bat Brewing Company to release Screamin' Eagle Lager.\n\nThe restaurant describes the beer as \"crisp, refreshing.\" It's available in 16-ounce cans \"until we sell out!\"\n\n\"A beautiful spin on our traditional Eagle, all artwork was down by our very own Orissa Camille,\" the restaurant wrote on Facebook. \"Get them while they last!\"\n\n— Ricardo Torres\n\nLong lines form at security checkpoint outside RNC\n\nA long line of cars and other vehicles had formed by 8 a.m. along North Water Street, leading up to a security checkpoint on West Michigan Street near North Plankinton Avenue.\n\nThe cars were waiting to go through one of the five security checkpoints along the edge of the security zone surrounding the RNC.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel were instructing drivers at the checkpoint on West Michigan Street to open the hoods of their vehicles, roll down all windows and remain in their vehicles. Once at the checkpoint, law enforcement opened each vehicle’s trunk to check inside and walked a canine around the vehicle.\n\nFrom near the front of the line at 7:45 a.m., Olivia Rivers of Racine said she had been waiting in line about an hour and a half. She works at the 3rd Street Market Hall and had gotten in line about 6:20 a.m. She was supposed to start work at 7.\n\n“The Market Hall told us we’d need an extra hour of travel time,” she said. “I didn’t figure it would take this long.”\n\nBritney Carter of Milwaukee also works inside the security zone and was late to work Monday morning because of the delays.\n\n“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said.\n\nShe works at the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and waited in line for about 40 minutes.\n\nAvery Leo, who lives in the security zone, also didn’t expect the long wait and said he would consider taking a different route to get home.\n\n“It’s annoying,” he said.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nDowntown RNC 'soft' security zone quiet\n\nThe downtown “soft” security zone/footprint where pedestrians can freely cross inside, was quiet Monday morning.\n\nPedestrians with various levels of credentials — or not — walked through and police at the fences denoting the credentials-only “hard” zone seemed relaxed. A few vehicles moved through the area.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nMicrosoft has 'deep fakes' training at noon and 5 p.m.\n\nAs part of its Democracy Forward campaign, Microsoft Corp. is offering free training in Milwaukee on Monday aimed at helping political campaigns, activists and party officials identify and address deep fakes, which are images or videos convincingly altered to misrepresent someone as doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say.\n\nThe sessions, focused on women, democracy and elections, are at noon and 5 p.m. at Northern Lights, an event venue at 106 W. Seeboth St. Speakers will include Ginny Badanes, general manager of the Democracy Forward campaign; and Republican U.S. Reps. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma; Burgess Owens of Utah; and Kat Cammack of Florida.\n\n— Rick Barrett\n\nRon Johnson chart credited as difference-maker in Trump assassination attempt\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson may have played a serendipitous role in Trump surviving the Saturday assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\nThat’s because Trump, as he detailed in an interview with the New York Post, turned his head slightly the moment before shots were fired to read a chart on illegal immigration. The source of that chart? Johnson, who spoke about it on Fox News's Special Report with Bret Baier.\n\nIn an interview with Baier, the senator said he initially showed a chart on illegal immigration to Trump on a plane ride to a rally in Green Bay. The senator said that Trump liked the chart, and his team took it, tweaked it and used it at the Saturday rally.\n\nA bullet pierced Trump's right ear, but he wasn't seriously injured.\n\n“I’m happy to have been of service there,” Johnson said on the Fox News program.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nPolice make two arrests Sunday near RNC security zone, welcome party\n\nPolice made two arrests near the Republican National Convention grounds and its events Sunday.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said both incidents involved drunk people. One person was arrested near the Summerfest grounds, near where a convention welcome party was being held, and another was arrested after driving into a security barrier near the convention.\n\n“The events overnight were described to me as really uneventful,” Johnson said at a morning press conference. “There’s been a lot of preparation that’s gone on into the planning of this political convention and the bulk of that planning has been directly involved in and around the area of public safety.”\n\n— David Clarey\n\nRNC weather: It'll be a hot, humid day, with a chance of storms Monday night\n\nThe weather forecast looks hot for the convention's first day.\n\nMilwaukee is expected to see a high of 89 degrees around 5 p.m., with a heat index of 95, according to the National Weather Service. Heat indices in the 90s are expected between 1 and 8 p.m. High humidity is also in the forecast throughout the day, causing things to feel \"uncomfortable,\" said Milwaukee-Sullivan NWS meteorologist Marcia Cronce.\n\nThe heat and humidity should feel similar to Sunday, when Milwaukee County was under a heat advisory. However, a heat advisory isn't expected to be issued Monday because heat indices will be just below 100 degrees instead of at or over 100, Cronce explained. Still, the Weather Service urges people to stay hydrated, limit time outside and take other precautions to prevent heat-related illness.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are possible between 7 p.m. and midnight, with chances peaking at 62% around 9 p.m. Some storms could be severe, Cronce said, with damaging winds being the main threat.\n\nHeavy rain, hail and even tornadoes are possible, Cronce added. The risk for severe storms is more likely near the Illinois border. Brief, heavy downpours are likely but shouldn't stay over single areas for extended periods.\n\nThe hot weather should subside by Tuesday after a cold front moves in overnight, Cronce said.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat time is the RNC? Here's the Republican National Convention schedule, events for Monday\n\nThe first official session of the convention starts at 12:35 p.m. and runs until 4:45 p.m. A second official session will follow at 5:45 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m.\n\nHowever, the day is littered with events before and after the official sessions.\n\nThe events kick off at 8 a.m., with The Heritage Foundation’s policy-centric event called the Heritage Policy Fest: Fighting for America’s Future and state delegation breakfasts throughout the early morning. Other events include things like a screening of \"Reagan,\" the 2024 Dennis Quaid-led biopic of the former president.\n\nThe convention isn't open to the general public, but according to an RNC spokesperson, you can stream it on YouTube, X, Facebook Live, Rumble, Amazon Prime, Twitch and Direct TV.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel will also be streaming RNC events.\n\nThe City Channel will broadcast the Republican National Convention beginning at 6 p.m. Monday. It'll air 24/7 and end at midnight Friday. Viewers can watch via Spectrum Cable on Channel 25 as well as on the “Livestream 1” feed.\n\nOther coverage will be available through Spectrum News and Fox News Media.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; group receptions; groups like Moms for Liberty, the American Jewish Committee and the European Union will host events; and there will be more movie screenings, too.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration and more information can be found here.\n\n— David Clarey\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson strikes tone of unity\n\nIn a briefing outside City Hall early Monday morning, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he would avoid focusing on political differences in light of the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nJohnson, a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, instead struck a tone of unity.\n\n“While Democrats and Republicans differ substantially on how we get there, the fact of the matter is … that we all want people of this country to succeed,” he said. “We want families in Milwaukee to have the opportunity to thrive. We want financial stability. We want peace, we want growth, we want health for citizens here, across our state and across our country.”\n\nJohnson also said he thought Biden was “showcasing leadership” in the wake of the attack on Trump by pausing political ads and events.\n\nHe also acknowledged the presidential election rematch between Trump and Biden in November.\n\n“Although the president may not be engaging in political activity in this specific moment in light of what’s happened, I’ve got no doubt that those things will continue,” Johnson said. “Obviously, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago next month and the president will have the opportunity to showcase the difference between his policies, what he’s done, what he intends to do for the United States and its people in the future.”\n\nHe said he was looking forward to serving as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention and working to ensure Biden wins a second term in November.\n\nJohnson said he felt “great” about having the RNC in the city, saying he wanted the event to serve as a stepping stone toward further growth.\n\n— Alison Dirr\n\nRNC security plan 'strengthened,' Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service has \"strengthened\" its security plan in the wake of Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement Monday morning.\n\n“I am confident in the security plan our Secret Service RNC coordinator and our partners have put in place, which we have reviewed and strengthened in the wake of Saturday’s shooting,” Cheatle’s statement said.\n\n“In addition to the additional security enhancements we provided former President Trump's detail in June, we have also implemented changes to his security detail since Saturday to ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign.”\n\nThe statement comes a day after the Secret Service’s RNC coordinator, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, said the agency was “not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans.”\n\nIn Monday’s statement, Cheatle said the security plans for events like the RNC are “designed to be flexible.”“As the conventions progress, and in accordance with the direction of the President, the Secret Service will continuously adapt our operations as necessary in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security for convention attendees, volunteers and the City of Milwaukee,” she said.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny after a gunman was able to shoot and injure Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally Saturday in Pennsylvania from a nearby rooftop. One man, Corey Comperatore, was killed and two people were injured, and Secret Service snipers killed the gunman, identified by the FBI as Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n— Sarah Volpenhein\n\nTrump will appear at the convention on Monday\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will make an appearance Monday at the Republican National Convention, said RNC committee member David Bossie in an interview with WISN-TV (Channel 12).\n\nTrump has yet to name his vice presidential pick. Asked whether a running mate would join Trump on stage Monday, Bossie said: \"I don't get ahead of him, but that's — the plan is, it's imminent, for certain.\"\n\nTrump’s motorcade arrived Sunday night at the Pfister Hotel, where many expect he'll be staying.\n\nSecret Service agents lined the perimeter and eyed the surrounding rooftops as dozens of SUVs pulled up to the storied hotel.\n\nTrump, however, could not be spotted exiting his vehicle. A tent was waiting outside the entrance, and security quickly pulled the curtains shut.\n\n— Genevieve Redsten\n\nCoalition to March on the RNC 2024 will continue as planned Monday\n\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC held a press conference Sunday afternoon to share updates on their planned march route Monday.\n\nOn Friday, organizers shared a revised route plan and said they had reached a “handshake agreement” with the Milwaukee Police Department and the city attorney’s office, though city officials didn't confirm the agreement.\n\nOmar Flores, the coalition’s co-chair, said the group reconfirmed the route with the city Saturday night.\n\nThe group said Sunday that a representative from the city attorney’s office would join the route “to ensure that there’s no problems.”\n\nThe route is separate from the city’s designated parade route.\n\nFlores said the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump does not change their messaging. Asked multiple times by reporters if the group condemned the shooting, Flores repeated “it has nothing to do with us.”\n\nThe coalition will hold a press conference 10 a.m. Monday, followed by a rally at 11 a.m. and a march at noon. The group currently only plans to march Monday.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhat road closures and parking restrictions will be in place during the RNC?\n\nNumerous downtown Milwaukee streets will be closed in downtown Milwaukee in and around the security perimeter until Friday at about 1 a.m.:\n\nWest Wisconsin Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Wells Street closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and James Lovell Street\n\nWest Kilbourn Avenue closed between Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and North 8th Street\n\nKilbourn Avenue exit tunnel closed from Interstate 43\n\nKilbourn Avenue entrance tunnel closed to I-43\n\nWest State Street closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive\n\nWest Juneau Avenue closed between North 8th Street and Old World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (Moderne Condo garage will be accessible to residents)\n\nNorthbound I-43 offramp closed at eastbound and westbound Fond du Lac Avenue\n\nWest Fond du Lac Avenue, West McKinley Avenue and East Knapp Street closed between I-43 and North Water Street\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no northbound traffic past West Juneau Avenue (the Aloft Hotel will be accessible to guests)\n\nOld World 3rd / Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, no southbound traffic past West McKinley Avenue\n\nNorth Vel R.

There will also be disruptions to the County's paratransit service, Transit Plus, for riders with disabilities.\n\nBublr Bikes, Milwaukee's bikeshare system, will shut down seven of its stations until Friday. The stations are all located downtown in and around the security perimeter.\n\nMilwaukee's Hop streetcar will run on a normal schedule from 5 a.m. to midnight and arrive every 15 minutes.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhen does the RNC start? When is the Republican National Convention?\n\nThe RNC begins Monday, July 15.\n\nHow long does the RNC last? What are the RNC convention dates?\n\nThe convention runs four days, from Monday, July 15 through Thursday, July 18.\n\nHow to watch the RNC convention\n\nThe convention venues are closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers. However, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. FOX News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\nWhat's the RNC 2024 convention schedule?\n\nHere's the master schedule of events for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe convention is closed to all but delegates, politicians, media members and volunteers.\n\nThroughout the week, guests are invited to attend official sessions at the convention venues; affinity group receptions; lectures and presentations; and film screenings.\n\nMany events require tickets or registration; be sure to consult the master calendar for information on how to register.\n\nThe official convention watch party takes place each day at the Drink Wisconsinbly Pub, 320 W. Highland Ave., across from Fiserv Forum.\n\n— Claire Reid\n\nWhat's the RNC convention location?\n\nFiserv Forum, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, is the main venue for the RNC. That's also where the first Republican debate was held in August. Thousands of delegates will gather there to hear the big speeches.\n\nThe nearby University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panther Arena and the Baird Center will also be used as spaces for the event.\n\nHere's more about each venue:\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nCan I get tickets to the Republican National Convention?\n\nUnless you're a delegate, politician, media member or volunteer, you won't be able to attend the RNC. Those attendees already have credentials to get inside the convention venues.\n\nIn other words, you can't buy a ticket to get into the convention if you're a member of the public.\n\nBut there are other RNC-related events that are open to the public. And, there are plenty of ways to watch the RNC. Numerous platforms will stream the convention, including the Journal Sentinel. Fox News Media will also have coverage across all of its platforms.\n\n— Hope Karnopp\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention, or DNC, in 2024?\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago — less than 100 miles south of the RNC — from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/22/feeding-animals-crowding-paradise-fighting-coastal-erosion-news-around-states/117158660/", "title": "Feeding the animals, crowding paradise: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The Federal Aviation Administration is considering a plan to land commercial space vehicles in the state. The agency recently released information about a proposal by the Huntsville airport and Nevada-based Sierra Space to use the site roughly 15 miles west of downtown to land ships that resemble a small space shuttle with upswept wings, WHNT-TV reports. The spacecraft would be launched elsewhere and land on an existing runway in Huntsville, which has the largest commercial airport in north Alabama and is a hub for the aerospace industry. The Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority said the FAA is conducting a preliminary review of the proposal. A study completed in 2015 found the airport compatible for the so-called Dream Chaser, which Sierra Space describes as a “spaceplane” designed to take crew and cargo into low-Earth orbit. It would be launched on an Atlas V rocket. Both the airport and the company would need licenses before any landings could occur.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A split federal appeals court panel has sent back for further legal review a 2019 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw proposed restrictions on large-scale mining in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the matter back to a lower court to determine whether the agency’s action “was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to law.” The appeals court panel expresses “no view on that question,” the decision dated Thursday said. The EPA during the Obama administration proposed but never finalized restrictions on large-scale mining in response to the Pebble Mine project. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the agency withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine” and allowing the project to be vetted through the permitting process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last fall rejected a key permit for the proposed copper and gold mine. Pebble’s developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, is appealing that decision. Trout Unlimited and other groups sued over the EPA’s 2019 decision. Nelli Williams, Alaska director for Trout Unlimited, called the ruling “an important step toward providing immediate Clean Water Act safeguards for Bristol Bay.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: A wig store that serves people who’ve lost their hair to chemotherapy continues to require shoppers to wear masks to protect people with cancer from COVID-19. But last month, the suburban Phoenix shop started receiving harassing phone calls after the founder of an anti-mask group tried to ruin the business by posting its name, phone number and address on social media. Since then, Sunny’s Hair and Wigs has received an outpouring of support from concerned citizens and even a visit from Mesa Mayor John Giles and city Councilman Francisco Heredia. “It’s just been overwhelming,” shop owner Lisa Memberr said. Memberr said her staff has been inundated with phone calls and visits from complete strangers bringing food, treats and some cash and “just letting them know that people care and that we are not alone in this and that they support what we did and are taking action to show that.” The store recently received a check for $1,000 from a woman in New Jersey to help buy wigs for people undergoing cancer treatment. The store was targeted May 28 by Ethan Schmidt, the 23-year-old founder of an anti-mask group who travels around metro Phoenix confronting businesses that still require customers to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 while claiming he is the victim of discrimination.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The head of the flagship University of Arkansas campus announced Thursday that he was stepping down, citing the challenge of leading the school in “today’s polarized society.” University of Arkansas Chancellor Joe Steinmetz’s resignation, which took effect Friday, came after the UA Board of Trustees met in executive session but took no action. “I still strongly believe in the mission of higher education, yet given the many challenges found trying to manage a university in today’s polarized society, I need to do what’s best for my family and I feel ready to make way for others,” Steinmetz said in a statement announcing his decision. He did not elaborate. Steinmetz’s resignation also followed his recommendation last month to move a campus statue of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright in response to complaints about Fulbright’s support of segregationist legislation. Republican lawmakers during a hearing last week told Steinmetz that such a move would violate a new state law protecting monuments and could result in criminal charges. Steinmetz has served as the school’s chancellor since January 2016. The university said in a release that UA System President Donald R. Bobbitt would visit with the campus and the school’s supporters before announcing plans for choosing the next chancellor.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is now offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccinations that they can use to access businesses or events that require proof they got the shots. The state’s public health and technology departments said the new tool allows Californians access to their COVID-19 records from the state’s immunization registry and includes the same information as the paper cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To access the information, Californians will enter into a state website their name, date of birth, and the email or phone associated with their vaccine records, and they will be asked to create a four-digit PIN. The record will include a QR code that users can save to their mobile phones. With nearly 20 million people fully vaccinated in California and proof of vaccination already required in some circumstances such as travel, state health officials felt there would be demand for the tool, though it remains optional, said Dr. Erica Pan, the state’s epidemiologist. “The odds are someone is going to misplace their paper CDC card, and a digital COVID-19 vaccine record provides a convenient backup,” she told reporters Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A coalition that wants to ask voters to approve higher taxes on recreational marijuana to help children make up for learning losses during the pandemic and address special needs for low-income and disadvantaged students said it’s been endorsed by former Democratic and Republican governors. Learning Opportunities for Colorado’s Kids is circulating petitions in hopes of collecting nearly 250,000 voter signatures needed by Aug. 2 to place its initiative on the November ballot. The campaign said former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, former Republican Gov. Bill Owens, state lawmakers from both parties, and a host of educational and advocacy groups, many serving Black and Latino children, have endorsed the effort. Initiative 25 would create a Colorado Learning Authority within the state education department to oversee out-of-school tutoring, English language instruction, special needs and disability instruction, mental health, and career and technical training for children ages 5 to 17. It would generally help children from low-income families and those falling behind their grade levels by certifying tutors, who can be teachers doing the work outside regular hours. To pay for the program, backers want voters to approve a 5% excise tax increase on recreational marijuana by 2024 to generate more than $137 million a year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: One of the state’s legendary music clubs is reopening after a yearlong closure due to the pandemic, with the help of the federal government. Toad’s Place celebrated with its first live music, a jazz duo, Friday along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. The club had been closed since March 2020. Blumenthal called the club “iconic.” Toad’s opened in the 1970s and has been a hot spot for local bands but also has hosted acts such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, U2 and, more recently, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar. The club was awarded a $1 million grant through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program. Venues that lost at least 90% of their revenues during the pandemic are eligible. DeLauro said the federal government has received about 13,000 applications for aid from entertainment venues, and it appears there is enough money to provide support to those that qualify. Catherine Marx, Connecticut district director for the Small Business Administration, said grants had been prioritized for the venues that had been hardest-hit by the pandemic, and Toad’s is one of 10 Connecticut venues to receive funds so far, the New Haven Register reports. “We’ve missed our performing arts. We’ve missed going out,” Marx said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Lawmakers want to add protections in the state constitution for the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities. House Bill 199 by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, would add “sexual orientation,” “gender identity” and “disability” to the Delaware Constitution’s equal rights clause. The legislation would make the First State the first state in the U.S. to add these protections for LGBTQ people to its constitution, lawmakers said. In Delaware, constitutional amendments require lawmakers to pass one bill for two consecutive legislative sessions, which span two years. This bill would be the first of two, and the next one would not be voted on until 2023 at the earliest. Earlier this year, lawmakers amended the constitution to add anti-discrimination protections for people of color. In 2019, they amended it to prohibit discrimination based on sex. The new bill comes five years after lawmakers failed to agree on a similar, more inclusive proposal from then-Sen. Karen Peterson that would have added protections for race, sex and national origin, along with age, religion, creed, color, familial status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, several new Democratic lawmakers – including members of the LGBTQ community – have been elected to the Statehouse.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The fight for D.C. statehood continues this week at the U.S. Capitol as proponents prepare to make their case in front of a Senate committee, WUSA-TV reports. The hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is scheduled for Tuesday morning, according to a statement from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who said it will be only the second time ever the Senate has held a hearing on statehood for the nation’s capital. Many of the arguments at Tuesday’s hearing will likely echo those made at another hearing earlier this year. In March, Norton told a House committee that “Congress can no longer allow D.C. residents to be sidelined in the Democratic ... process.” For Norton and many other supporters, statehood for the district is a civil rights issue. “Denying American citizens a vote in the body that taxes them goes against the founding principles of this great nation,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at that same hearing. However, GOP opposition in the House was strong, with many Republicans calling the push for statehood a political power grab to tip the balance in Congress in Democrats’ favor.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Coast: A high school principal spent the last several months of the school year crafting personalized notes for each of 459 graduates and left them on their seats to read before receiving their diplomas. Matanzas High School principal Jeff Reaves scoured through transcripts, emails and his own personal memories to prepare the notes in time for the June 2 graduation. He wanted to do something special since the seniors’ last two years were marred by the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to be positive for our students, especially in a time where there’s a lot of negativity and turmoil in the world,” Reaves said. “I wanted to shine some light on the students and encourage them as they begin their next journey in life.” He said the process was especially beneficial to him because he got a chance to learn more about each student. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but it’s the names that really matter. I was doing my part to help them feel connected as a community and have their high school experience to be positive.” Reaves said he’s always tried to work in something special for each class, by recognizing certain students and through the songs played at commencements. Last June, seniors graduated at Daytona International Speedway, and the school put customized yard signs for each student on the football field.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The coastal county where Ahmaud Arbery’s slaying raised an outcry over racial injustice has hired its first full-time Black police chief. Glynn County commissioners voted Thursday for Jacques Battiste to lead an embattled department that some state lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to abolish last year. A former FBI agent now serving as a deputy constable in New Orleans, Battiste was chosen after a search conducted by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police with assistance from the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. “I promise you I will bring my best game every day,” Battiste told residents during a community forum last week. Battiste’s hiring comes after a turbulent year for the Glynn County Police Department. The agency was widely criticized for making no arrests after Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased and fatally shot by three white men who spotted him running in their neighborhood Feb. 23, 2020. Charges came more than two months later after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over. Days after Arbery’s killing, Glynn County Police Chief John Powell was indicted on unrelated malfeasance charges in what prosecutors called an illegal effort to cover up a narcotics officer’s affair with a confidential informant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHana: Some people who live in east Maui say the famed Road to Hana is becoming a gridlocked maze of illegally parked cars driven by tourists. Residents are asking for state and county help to address the traffic and parking problem, Hawaii News Now reports. Maui has seen an influx of visitors as pandemic restrictions have eased. The drive to Hana is among the most popular tourist activities on the island. Now that 8,000 visitors a day are arriving on Maui, the narrow, winding road is getting jammed. The coastal roadway brings visitors past waterfalls and sea cliffs along a rural and lush Hawaii rainforest. The remote shoreline’s residents are among the most geographically isolated in the state. Officials say 400 to 600 people drive the road each day. The state recently installed signs warning people of parking fines. But residents want a more comprehensive traffic plan. “We know our visitors are important to our economy. But there comes a time where you really start to look at the numbers,” said east Maui resident Kamalani Pahukoa, who often sees traffic jams and illegally parked rental cars. “That becomes a problem to our quality of life, traditions, culture and access.” Toll roads and reservation systems are among ideas being looked at, said Lauren Armstrong, the Maui Metropolitan Planning Organization’s executive director.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a plan for Boise government to be carbon neutral by 2035 and the entire city by 2050 to fight climate change. The Boise City Council voted unanimously last week to approve the Climate Action Roadmap. The plan includes a goal for government to use only clean electricity by 2030. Carbon neutrality means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero.” The goal is to reduce carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas warming the atmosphere. “Tonight is truly a historic moment for our city,” Mayor Lauren McLean said after the vote. “We’re the generation that must solve the climate crisis because our health and economy depend on us doing this now. Boise will be a climate innovation leader, and we will rise to the challenge of this moment.” The capital city has about 225,000 residents. Benefits of the plan include improving human health and growing a climate-friendly economy, officials said. Ways for the city to meet carbon neutrality include such things as switching to electric vehicles or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees that store carbon. The plan also calls for using less energy, traveling less and reducing waste. “It is a detailed plan with attainable goals,” Councilman Patrick Bageant said. “It’s not just a declaration of a wish list; it’s an actual plan that we will begin to execute.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s primary election will be moved from March to June next year under a voter access expansion signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The new law makes mail voting a permanent option, allows jail inmates awaiting trial to cast ballots and makes Election Day in November a state holiday, among other things. The move is in contrast with other states that are moving to restrict voter access. “With attacks on voting rights on the rise in states across the nation, Illinois is proud to stand up for a strong, secure, and accessible democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement Thursday. The law took effect immediately. Next year’s primary will move from March 15 to June 28 because lawmakers decided not to draw new post-census district boundaries for members of Congress until official 2020 census figures, delayed by the pandemic, arrive later this summer. Many changes continue or expand existing practices put in place last year to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Election Day would continue to be a state holiday, with empty schools used as polling places. Also, Illinois counties would be required to establish at least one universal voting center to give voters alternatives sites.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man who threatened his neighbor with anti-Black racial slurs, displayed a swastika and threw eggs in an attempt to intimidate the neighbor has been sentenced to 46 months in prison and three years supervised release for criminal violations of the Fair Housing Act and unlawful possession of firearms. Shepherd Hoehn, 51, pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year. Among other racist actions, Hoehn burned a cross above the fence line facing his neighbor’s property and repeatedly played Confederate-era minstrel anthem “Dixie.” The intimidation began when Hoehn became angry as a construction crew began to remove a tree from the neighbor’s property, according to court documents. “Today, Mr. Hoehn was held responsible for his vile conduct,” Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBI Indianapolis Division said in a press release Friday. The case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Lawrence Police Department. “We are a diverse nation, bound together by shared values and beliefs,” Keenan said. “We are also a nation of laws. Those like Mr. Hoehn who would betray our shared values and beliefs through behavior such as this rightly suffer the penalties our laws prescribe.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A sharply divided Iowa Supreme Court on Friday stopped a lawsuit aimed at reducing the flow of fertilizer and hog farm waste into the state’s river and streams, finding that limiting pollution from farms was a political matter and not one for the courts. The 4-3 decision handed a significant defeat to environmental groups hoping to get the chance to prove that Iowa should scrap its voluntary farm pollution policy, order new mandatory limits on nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, and stop construction of new hog barns. It is the latest court rejection of an attempt to force the nation’s leading corn- and pork-producing state to clean up farm pollutants from its major rivers that provide drinking water to hundreds of thousands of Iowans. The lawsuit, which was brought by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Food & Water Watch, contended that unregulated farm pollution is violating the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River for recreational and drinking water use. It said a legal concept that precedes Iowa statehood – the public trust doctrine – should apply to this case and require the state to ensure that citizens have a usable Raccoon River untainted by excess pollution caused by farm runoff of fertilizer and animal manure.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A team of archaeologists – Jay Sturdevant, Adam Wiewel, Nikki Klarmann and Robert Hoard – recently spent two days in the city laying the groundwork for an excavation project to take place next summer at the Brown v. Board National Historic Site. The Kansas Archeology Training Program field school will be held June 3-19, 2022. The public is welcome to help excavate land archaeologists believe will yield artifacts and the foundations of demolished buildings. Klarmann, public outreach archaeologist for the Kansas Historical Society, said the field school is an opportunity to get a taste of archaeology. “A lot of people think maybe it’s just going out, digging and collecting, but there’s a lot more to it than that. They get experience in the field excavating but also in the lab analyzing artifacts,” Klarmann said. The field school is open to anyone over age 12. Registration will open March 1, 2022, with a registration fee of $15-$90. Klarmann said most participants are people who are curious and don’t have an archaeology background. “Really it’s just people who are interested in history and learning more about their state,” Klarmann said. “We also have people who come from California to do this, and they’ve been coming for years.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Thousands of Kentuckians can now apply for a waiver that could clear them from having to repay the overpayments included in their unemployment benefits. The Kentucky Office of Unemployment Insurance says it has mailed notices to about 14,000 unemployment claimants identified as having been overpaid in 2020. The notices inform claimants how much they were overpaid and provide instructions on how to apply for the waiver, either online or by completing an enclosed form, the state agency said. Claimants have 30 days from the date postmarked on the letter to apply for the waiver and must attest that the overpayment was the result of no fault of their own, the agency said. Legislation allowing the state to waive the overpayment of some pandemic-related unemployment claims was passed by lawmakers this year and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear. The state has paid out more than $6 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, Beshear’s administration said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAvery Island: As storms grow more violent and Louisiana loses more of its coast, the family that makes Tabasco Sauce is fighting erosion in the marshland that buffers its factory from hurricanes and floods. Overall, the effort is probably a standoff, said CEO and President Harold “Took” Osborn, great-great-grandson of the McIlhenny Co.’s founder. But in a state that has lost 2,000 square miles of its coast since 1932, holding ground is a victory. The company has been brewing Tabasco Sauce since 1868 on Avery Island, the tip of a miles-deep column of salt. While sinking land is a problem throughout southern Louisiana, Avery Island and four smaller salt domes along the Gulf Coast are still slowly rising. But the danger from hurricanes remains. A 20-foot-high, $5 million earthen levee now encloses the 40 acres or so around Tabasco’s factory after Hurricane Rita’s storm surge pushed floodwaters within inches of it in 2005. Much of the wetlands work is low-tech, enlisting volunteers to plant marsh grass in the 30,000 acres around the island. Osborn holds a master’s degree in environmental science from Oxford University, and company founder Edmund McIlhenny was a self-taught naturalist. Osborn’s great-grandfather, E.A. McIlhenny, created an egret rookery at the island in 1895 because the birds were nearing extermination by hunters who sold their plumage to adorn women’s hats.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A statewide ban on single-use plastic bags will begin July 1. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said it is working with retail stores and restaurants to make sure they are ready. The Legislature passed the ban in 2019, and it was initially scheduled to go into effect in April 2020. The state delayed enforcement of the ban because of aspects of the coronavirus pandemic. The first delay was due to concerns about the transmission of the virus and a second delay due to concerns stemming from disruption in packing supplies amid the pandemic, the DEP said. When the ban takes effect, stores and restaurants will not be allowed to provide single-use plastic bags, the DEP said. Grocery stores, box stores and other large retailers must collect a 5 cent fee for each such bag used, the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Replacing Amtrak’s Baltimore & Potomac Tunnel will take a least a decade or more to complete. But the $4 billion rail project has officially begun, and officials say it will eliminate the biggest passenger rail bottleneck between Washington and New Jersey. The Baltimore Sun reports officials kicked off the project’s start at an event Friday that included the great-great-granddaughter of Frederick Douglass. The tunnel will be renamed after the famed abolitionist. Douglass had escaped the bonds of slavery on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and eventually boarded a New York-bound train from Baltimore in 1838. “If it had not been for the railroad,” Nettie Washington Douglass told the Sun in an interview, “I would not be standing here.” Jeffrey Ensor, Amtrak’s senior director for the south end of the Northeast Corridor, said the new tunnel will increase train speeds to more than 100 mph from 30 mph. Construction will be funded by the federal and state government because the tunnel is used by Amtrak and MARC passengers. Negotiations are underway to determine how much each government will contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: In a move likely to strike a chord with music fans, the Boston Symphony Orchestra has announced plans to reopen Symphony Hall and resume in-person performances for a complete season starting in September. The BSO will open the 2021-22 season Sept. 30 – after an 18-month live-audience performance hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic – with Music Director Andris Nelsons sharing the podium with Boston Pops Conductor Laureate John Williams for a program featuring soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The program will feature Beethoven’s Consecration of the House Overture, the work that opened the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 1881. The reopening concert will also feature the Boston premiere of a new work by Williams, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra. The season that runs until next April also features a new cycle of six major works by Richard Strauss; a performance cycle of five Beethoven concertos with soloist Mitsuko Uchida; orchestra works of Berlioz, Brahms, Ives, Mahler, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Still and Stravinsky; and world premieres by Julia Adolphe, HK Gruber, and Kaija Saariaho and American premieres by Unsuk Chin and Jorg Widmann. To celebrate the reopening of Symphony Hall, the BSO will also present a free community concert Oct. 3 featuring Nelsons, Williams, Keith Lockhart and Thomas Wilkins.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Organizers of a popular festival that was shut down last year due to the pandemic are encouraging people attending this summer to receive free COVID-19 vaccinations on-site. Masks will not be required at the 95th National Cherry Festival, scheduled July 3-10 at Traverse City’s Open Space Park, according to MLive.com. The Grand Traverse Health Department will offer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a tent at the park. Michigan lifted all indoor capacity restrictions and mask requirements Monday as the state’s vaccination rate increases and the numbers of COVID-19 infections continue to decrease. “With the impossibility of knowing when restrictions would be lifted or changed, we had to start planning in January to provide Traverse City with a safe, family-friendly event that allowed everyone to participate no matter how ready they are to fully enter back into ‘normal’ life,” said Kat Paye, festival executive director. The festival, a major northern Michigan summer destination for decades, typically offers parades, fireworks, concerts, farm tours, a carnival midway and cherry pie-eating contests. Many event spaces will be reconfigured this year. Some activities will be presented in new ways, such as the festival parade being stationary instead of participants marching along a parade route.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A new student group in the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry aims to continue the effort to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in the school. Better Together hosted its first event May 25, exactly one year after George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. Arpun Johal, a third-year student and one of the group’s founding members, said Floyd’s murder prompted the group’s formation, The Minnesota Daily reports. “Last year, I feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the U.S.,” Johal said. “From that, we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement.” The group’s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, anti-Asian racism, the experiences of Asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to Asian students and patients. Zayna Jan, another third-year student and founding member of Better Together, created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize. “I wanted (the toolkit) to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly – and for it to be dental school-specific,” Jan said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The more than 1,500 Mississippi National Guard members who have been working throughout the state over the course of the coronavirus pandemic to help with virus testing, vaccinations and other initiatives are being withdrawn next month, Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday. The state will cease all operations with the Mississippi National Guard on July 15, Reeves said. The Republican governor also announced that he will lift the COVID-19 state of emergency order Aug. 15. While all pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted, the state of emergency order has remained in place to ensure that members of the National Guard continue to be paid while stationed in Mississippi. Guard members have been serving in Mississippi since March 2020, stationed at dozens of state-run vaccination and testing sites. Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard Maj. Gen. Janson D. Boyles said Friday that the governor’s timeline to lift Mississippi’s state of emergency declaration ensures his service members will “complete all necessary out-processing requirements and receive the benefits and entitlements they have earned during their dedicated service to our state.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Summer classes have moved online for some elementary and middle school students because of COVID-19 cases. The St. Joseph News-Press reports Robidoux and Pershing schools will conduct classes virtually through July 1, when summer school ends. Only about 1 in 5 eligible residents, or 20.6%, have received a COVID-19 vaccine in Buchanan County, where St. Joseph is located. That’s below the still-low statewide average of 37%. The vaccine is generally available to all people 12 and older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any vaccine for those under age 12, which has been a cause for increased precautions regarding COVID-19 in an elementary school environment. “We just took a precautionary measure,” said Gabe Edgar, the district’s assistant superintendent, adding that because the district has a remote learning system in place, it “really doesn’t make sense to leave those kids in there, potentially at risk.” She said all other summer school locations will remain in person. Summer sessions already were being conducted online only for high school students.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park says it’s seeing more visitors showing up early in the morning and evening when the park’s new ticketed entry system is not in effect. Glacier administrators say people who arrive at the park’s West entrance after 5 p.m. should expect heavy traffic and long waits. The park in northwestern Montana on the Canada border had almost 300,000 visits through May. That’s the highest year-to-date number on record. To ease congestion on the popular Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier this year began requiring visitors to obtain an entry ticket and reservation prior to arrival. About a quarter of Memorial Day weekend visitors arrived without a reservation at the park’s West and St. Mary entrances.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Work has begun on nearly $30 million in renovation projects that will change the entrance to Omaha’s Eppley Airfield and upgrade one of the national airport’s garages. The entrance to the airport terminal will be moved about a quarter-mile south, toward downtown along Abbott Drive, the Omaha World-Herald reports, under a project estimated at $20.8 million. The change comes following several studies in recent years showing the need for a longer, wider entrance that will give drivers more time to make maneuvering decisions. The $8.3 million in improvements to the airport’s south garage will include construction of an express ramp to provide access to premier parking and provide wider parking stalls. Both projects include new signs, lights and landscaping. Construction began Wednesday and is slated to be finished by late 2022. Both the terminal and south garage will be open during construction, although drivers may encounter occasional minor detours or closures. Most of the funding for the projects will come from Omaha Airport Authority revenues, but the terminal entrance project is getting a $12 million boost in grants from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a second year of intense drought, the Nevada Department of Wildlife’s water developments – the only source of water for miles for desert bighorn sheep – have hit perilously low storage levels in Valley of Fire State Park. Without the agency’s emergency intervention, animal populations will decline, and ecosystem viability is threatened. “We’ve had drought conditions before. We have had to haul water on an emergency basis, but not anywhere near approaching this magnitude, this scale of severity,” Wildlife Game Biologist Pat Cummings told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I have been in Southern Nevada since the mid-’70s. I remember 2001 and 2002 as being the worst, back-to-back dry years, even worse than 1996. But what we see now is even worse, even worse.” Last year, Las Vegas went 240 days without measurable rainfall. This year, 40% of the state is in exceptional drought, the highest level, according to the National Weather Service. “All animals, especially bighorn sheep, which have evolved to coexist with the desert environment, rely a lot on the vegetation for water,” Southern Region Game Supervisor Joe Bennett said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Disciplinary hearings for police officers accused of misconduct serious enough for decertification should not be automatically held behind closed doors, a judge ruled. The judge’s decision came as the Legislature voted to make disciplinary proceedings public. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu told New Hampshire Public Radio that the governor supports the bill. The Union Leader newspaper sued over the disciplinary proceedings of a detective and an officer in Manchester, arguing that the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council’s practice of shielding hearings and certain records from public view, if requested by the officer, was a violation of the state’s Right to Know law. Judge Andrew Schulman agreed that the council should no longer automatically exempt the public from reading materials or viewing disciplinary proceedings. However, the order does not create a blanket requirement that all disciplinary proceedings be made public. The attorney general’s office is still reviewing the decision and hasn’t said if it will appeal.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: In a state where medical marijuana is often more expensive than flying elsewhere and buying it there, patients registered with some financial assistance programs could see their weed costs covered. The cost of New Jersey medical marijuana, among the highest of any state in the country, would be covered for patients enrolled in four different financial assistance programs meant to help children, seniors, crime victims and those with disabilities, under identical bills already approved by the Senate and Assembly health committees. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, could see votes as soon as this week. Under the legislation, patients enrolled in these programs could only have to pay a small copay for medical marijuana or have their costs covered: the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled, the Senior Gold Prescription Discount and the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. “The cost of cannabis can run into the hundreds of dollars per month for individuals,” Conaway said. “This bill serves those who are financially distressed and ... ensures the benefits of medical cannabis are available to all who may need it.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state ranked 49th in a report released Monday measuring child well-being based on data gathered before the pandemic. That’s an improvement over last year, when New Mexico ranked 50th among U.S. states. “It’s encouraging to see that child well-being in New Mexico was improving before the pandemic hit,” said James Jimenez, executive director for New Mexico Voices for Children, which partners with the foundation. He said he’s cautiously optimistic that state policies “helped offset some of the health and financial problems caused by the pandemic.” The annual Kids Count report released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation tracks 16 metrics of children’s access to education, health, economic and social stability at home. It ranks New Mexico at or near the bottom on education, economics, and “family and community,” which tracks rates of single-parent homes, teen birth rates and whether the head of household has a high school degree. Roughly 1 in 5 New Mexico children lives in an area where 30% of the population is at or below the federal poverty line. Nationally, only 1 in 10 children lives in a high-poverty area, according to the report. The report ranks the state 37th in child health, with kids having average access to insurance (94%) and only slightly higher-than-average obesity (32%).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Stonewall Inn’s owners say they won’t serve certain beers at the famous LGBT bar during Pride weekend to protest manufacturer Anheuser-Busch’s political contributions to some politicians who have supported anti-LGBT legislation. Co-owners Stacy Lentz and Kurt Kelly said they would be instituting the ban Friday in support of the “Keep Your Pride” campaign, a recently launched effort highlighting five companies that it says advertise support during Pride but have also made contributions to anti-LGBT lawmakers. The campaign, a project of Corporate Accountability Action, used data compiled from the National Institute on Money in Politics to show that Anheuser-Busch contributed more than $35,000 to 29 legislators it described as anti-LGBT between 2015 and 2020. “We just felt Stonewall having the platform, the power to do this, it was important to stand up,” Lentz said. “We really just want Anheuser-Busch to stop donating to lawmakers who are trying to legalize discrimination.” In a statement, Anheuser-Busch said: “We support candidates for public office whose policy positions and objectives support investments in our communities, job creation, and industry growth.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A museum criticized for a planned reenactment of a white slave owner being pursued by Union soldiers says its doors will be closed until further notice, a local department said. The Mecklenburg Park and Recreation Department announced Thursday that the Historic Latta Plantation is closed and that all previously scheduled events are canceled while the department assesses the future use of the county-owned property, the agency said on its website. The house and the grounds also will be closed, the department said. The 19th-century house is owned by Mecklenburg County, while a nonprofit operates the facilities and runs the events at the plantation site. Last Tuesday, Mecklenburg County announced it would let its contract with the museum expire next month over the controversial event that many deemed as racially insensitive. The reenactment was scheduled for June 19, the traditional commemoration date of the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. known as Juneteenth. On Thursday, President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Officials say wildfires have burned about 156 square miles of land across the drought-stricken state so far this year – more than seven times the amount from all of last year. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services and North Dakota Forest Service report that nearly 1,400 fires have been confirmed in 2021. A total of 921 fires recorded last year burned less than 20 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months in 127 years of recordkeeping, according to State Forester Tom Claeys. Limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year, the Minot Daily News reports. Several local, tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires over the April 30-May 2 weekend. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland, north of Medora, burned more than 7 square miles, while another fire on the Fort Berthold Reservation, about 6 miles south of Mandaree, burned more than 15 square miles. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said, noting that the Fourth of July is “right around the corner.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Just like saving treats for furry friends waiting under the dining room table, utility company AEP Ohio will now donate its leftovers to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Trimmings from trees and shrubs pruned throughout the Columbus area to keep electric power lines clear will soon be used to feed giraffes, beavers and a variety of animals at the zoo and the safari park near Cumberland. Through a new partnership called “Trim to Treat,” AEP Ohio will deliver those leftovers to the zoo twice a week. Those trimmings will then be sorted through to determine what should be used to feed the animals. “We’re just really thankful,” said Jan Ramer, interim senior vice president for animal care and conservation at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Ramer said browse – the ecological term for tree trimmings – is good for the animals’ physical and mental health alike. It provides them with fiber needed to aid in their digestion, but it also provides the feeling of being in nature as opposed to captivity. Before the AEP Ohio partnership, Ramer said horticulturalists at the zoo would cut browse from trees and shrubs on its grounds. While that process won’t end with the formation of the partnership, Ramer said AEP’s contributions will supplement and support the zoo’s browse supply.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, which pioneered the use of electronic passes 30 years ago, is preparing to take a long-awaited first step toward cashless tolls but has yet to comply with a 2016 deadline to integrate the PikePass system with tolling authorities across the country. When introduced, the PikePass system was hailed as a way to reduce crashes that occurred at toll booths with drivers stopping and slowing down as well as a cost savings for the trucking industry. The turnpike authority reports 2,093,460 vehicles are tagged with PikePasses that stick to the top of a windshield and record when drivers enter and exit toll roads in Oklahoma. Toll booths, however, are still operated on the state’s 11 turnpikes, and traffic backups still occur at toll plazas along busy corridors like the Will Rogers, Turner and Kilpatrick turnpikes. Later this summer, the Kilpatrick Turnpike will be the first to be switched to cashless tolls in which drivers without PikePasses will be billed by mail. “We continue to have accidents at cash lanes, so the impact of this is enormous,” said spokesman Jack Damrill. “It will not just help with safety; it with help with the environment also.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities in Lake Oswego and Tigard are among communities asking residents to reduce water use during a chlorine shortage. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports water treatment facilities use the chemical in small amounts to prevent harmful bacteria growth in drinking water supply. State officials say they have a plan to help water districts get the chlorine they need if their stockpiles run low, and there’s no threat to the water on which the public depends. The shortage occurred after a power outage earlier this month at the Westlake chemical facility in Longview, Washington, the main provider of chlorine for Oregon. Matt Marheine, deputy director at the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, said the shortage is not unique to Oregon, and “the drinking water in the state of Oregon is clean and safe to use and drink.” The concern is how long the current chlorine supply will last. Most Oregon water districts have about a month’s supply of chlorine, according to Andre Ourso, administrator for the Oregon Health Authorities’ Center for Health Protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: The remains of 10 more Native American children who died more than a century ago at a boarding school in central Pennsylvania are being disinterred and will be returned to their relatives, authorities said. A team of archaeologists began work Saturday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, which also houses the U.S. Army War College. Nine of the children were from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota and one from the Alaskan Aleut tribe. The cemetery contains more than 180 graves of students who attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School – a government-run boarding school for Native American children. This is the Army’s fourth disinterment project at the school in as many years. The school founded by an Army officer opened in 1879 and housed some 10,000 Indigenous children before it shut down in 1918. Students were forced to cut their braids, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. Infectious disease and harsh conditions claimed the lives of many of the children buried there. The Army is fully funding the cost of the project – about $500,000 per year, including travel to the transfer ceremony as well as transport and reburial of the deceased children, said Barbara Lewandrowski of the Office of Army Cemeteries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles said he had no idea that a sex business was allegedly operating in a building he owns. Cranston police raided the building owned by Walter “Bud” Craddock through his real estate holdings company following a months­long investigation into six properties where investigators suspect prostitution was taking police, according to a police affidavit. Craddock told WPRI-TV he knew there was a business but didn’t know about any illegal activities. “I personally had never gotten any complaints, otherwise this would have been rectified a long time ago,” Craddock said. “If I was aware of the things that were alleged to be going on there, the lease would have been terminated.” The 3,200-square-foot property is one of several owned by Craddock’s LUC Realty and was subject of a raid in 2017 “for the same activity, prostitution and massage without a license,” Cranston Police Chief Col. Michael Winquist told WPRI in an email. All six massage businesses that were raided were shut down, 11 people were arrested, and police are investigating whether women were working against their will, Winquist said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Beach towns are ticketing more people for public drinking as summer visitors flock to the coast. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports open container citations on Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island have risen above their pre-pandemic levels. On Folly Beach, not a single person received an open container ticket in the weeks leading up to Memorial Day in 2019. This year, officers handed out seven citations between the end of April and May 23. On Sullivan’s Island, beach officers wrote 180 open container tickets ahead of Memorial Day, a 120% increase from tickets in the same period in 2019. Town officials say the alcohol violations might be related to people enjoying their lives as vaccinations have emboldened some and helped keep many COVID-19 cases at bay. Sullivan’s Island Town Administrator Andy Benke said open container tickets usually pick up after Memorial Day because the beach service officers, who are Citadel cadets this year, get better at ticketing – and less reluctant to punish beachgoers having a good time – over the summer. “If you’ve driven that far to spend the day at the beach, maybe you’re more inclined to roll the dice and take a chance,” Benke told the newspaper. “But Sullivan’s Island and Folly and Isle of Palms don’t allow alcohol on the beach. That’s just the way it is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An abandoned gypsum mine in Black Hawk that was exposed by a sinkhole in 2020 may extend farther than current mapped areas show, according to a geophysical study. Mohammad Sadeghi, a professor of geological engineering at Montana Technical University who led the study, said there’s a possibility that the mine extends below Interstate 90. The study recommends further research be done in the area. More than 40 people from 15 homes in the Hideaway Hills neighborhood were forced to evacuate after the collapse in April 2020 in Black Hawk, about 8 miles northwest of Rapid City. At least two lawsuits have been filed in relation to the collapse, one of which is one step closer to class-action status, the Rapid City Journal reports. The Fitzgerald Law firm of Rapid City filed a lawsuit against developers and county and state entities. Fox Rothschild, a large national law firm, filed one against state government. Hideaway Hills residents are also seeking answers to a potential loss of sewage service due to the mine. Sadeghi has presented his team’s research methods to Hideaway Hills residents and said he believed the sinkhole opened due to surface water infiltrating the ground and seeping into the roof of the mine that dissolved gypsum.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Correction announced it is participating in a service that provides the public with criminal case information and custody status of inmates. The Victim Information and Notification Everyday service will be used in conjunction with TDOC’s current victim notification system. That system already provides written notice of offenders’ location, transfer, sentence expiration, release and parole hearings.

The Austin school district announced Friday that it plans to return all students to campus and will not offer a remote learning option for the 2021-22 school year. Austin joins the Round Rock, Lake Travis, Leander, Eanes and Hays school districts in announcing the return to on-campus-only learning. The Austin district cited low COVID-19 case numbers as well as the Legislature’s failure to pass a bill that would have authorized local public schools to count students in remote learning programs as part of their enrollment. School districts are funded based on their daily enrollment numbers. The bill became a casualty of House Democrats’ walkout to kill a Republican voting bill ahead of a midnight deadline last month. Austin and 29 other school districts around the state sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday asking him to take up this legislation in the special session he has promised to call this summer to focus on overhauling the state’s voting laws.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A local public health expert says an increase in opioid abuse amid the coronavirus pandemic was recorded throughout the state. Gabriela Murza, who leads Utah State University Extension’s HEART initiative in Utah County, presented data to the Utah County Commission during a work session last week while discussing the state-funded program, which “brings academic resources into the community, partnering locally and nationally to address the opioid epidemic and other pressing public health issues,” the Daily Herald reports. According to Murza, the program operates in nine counties, including Utah County, “where opioid use disorder has had some of the most devastating effects as far as overdose and deaths related to opioid use.” Other counties served by the program include Salt Lake, Davis, Tooele and Box Elder. Murza told the commissioners that the rate of opioid use disorder has “leveled off” in recent years, and “the trend seems to be getting a little bit better in Utah.” But “then 2020 hit, and everywhere the numbers went up, they did increase as far as deaths due to opioids,” the public health professor said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An innovative health care program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs missed its financial target between 2017 and 2019, a new report by the Vermont state auditor has found. The report released Monday by State Auditor Douglas Hoffer said that OneCare Vermont, the organization set up to run the program, missed its Medicaid financial targets over the three years by $11.1 million. And the state paid $14.5 million for OneCare’s operating costs to reach a total of $25.6 million total. Hoffer said the financial costs to run the program exceeded any Medicaid savings attributed to it. The goal of what’s known as the all-payer model is to keep patients healthier while reducing health care costs by paying a set amount of money for each covered patient rather than paying for each service provided. “I anticipate the people implementing the All-Payer Model will say the scale and complexity of the reform initiative merit patience before reaching conclusions, and that is reasonable … to a point,” Hoffer said in a statement. OneCare CEO Vicki Loner said she disagreed with the conclusions of Hoffer’s report, and the organization is proud of the work it is doing “tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s “dangerously” full mental hospitals are overwhelmed amid staffing shortages, a situation that has long plagued the hospitals and only worsened during the pandemic, according to state officials. But The Washington Post reports lawmakers and policy experts hope pandemic relief funds can help bring about systematic changes that free inpatient beds and develop community services to keep people out of hospitals in the first place. When the General Assembly reconvenes in August, it will decide how to spend about $4 billion Virginia is getting from a pandemic relief package earlier this year. A joint subcommittee studying mental health services is preparing recommendations for how to use the funds in time for the session. “We have the opportunity with these funds to really do something transformational. That is what we are asking for,” Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services Commissioner Alison Land said in a presentation to the subcommittee this month. The state’s nine inpatient psychiatric hospitals, which have a total of 2,124 beds, are operating at an average 98% capacity, she said. And efforts to contain the coronavirus have had unintended consequences.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A federal judge has issued a summary judgment in favor of the state against two gold mining companies over years of water pollution stemming from the Buckhorn Mountain gold mine in Okanogan County. U.S. District Court Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson on Thursday dismissed the companies’ main defenses, writing there was no support for their claims that the state attorney general cannot enforce all of the mine’s Clean Water Act permit. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Bob Ferguson contended that Crown Resources and Kinross Gold violated the law by discharging illegal levels of pollutants into creeks in Okanogan County flowing into the Kettle River. Now the focus shifts to how much the companies will owe for the violations. They potentially face millions of dollars in penalties for their pollution, and the judge will decide how much. “Crown and Kinross knew even before the mine’s construction that it could release significant contamination, including arsenic and chloride, into surrounding waters, yet plowed ahead anyway,” Ferguson said. “Washington takes our water quality seriously.” Crown Resources and its parent company, Kinross Gold, extracted approximately $1.3 billion in gold from the mine from 2008 to 2017.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new campaign is encouraging residents to support small businesses as the economy continues to reopen. The West Virginia Small Business Development Center launched its “Come In, We’re Open” campaign Sunday. It’s an invitation to people to visit local businesses in their communities, center Director Debra Martin told The Exponent Telegram. “Throughout the pandemic, small-business owners have adapted and persevered and continue to be the backbone of our economy. As West Virginia reopens, it’s critical that small businesses receive enough support to survive long term,” she said. Business owners around the state can get involved by displaying a “Come In, We’re Open” sign and posting to social media with “#WeAreOpenWV.” The campaign will last through September, officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Superintendents, school board members and other education leaders on Monday demanded that Republican lawmakers devote more state aid to schools. Superintendents and other school officials have been criticizing the amount of state aid for education that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled finance committee inserted in the state budget proposal last week. The full Legislature is expected to pass the budget, which would run from this July through mid-2023, as soon as next week. School leaders predicted that without more state funding, they might have to hold staff salaries flat or cut liberal arts classes. “All students and staff across our state deserve better than zero,” Verona Area School District Superintendent Tremayne Clardy said outside the state Capitol. “This budget simply does not meet the needs of students and families across the state.” Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed giving K-12 schools $1.6 billion over the next two years. Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee scrapped that plan and instead allocated $128 million – about $400 million less than they needed to allocate to ensure the state’s schools would get about $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: With 80% of adults over 18 fully vaccinated in Teton County, health officials are launching an innovative effort to further increase the community’s protection from COVID-19. “The whole goal is to try to get to the people, to make it easier for people,” Public Health Response Coordinator Rachael Wheeler said. The Health Department’s new “Vaxi Taxi,” a repurposed START bus turned mobile vaccine clinic, aims to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines by reaching outlying populations that are unable to get their shots at the health department in town. “Having a more mobile unit where we can easily set up inside that unit becomes really convenient for us,” Wheeler said. Nurses check in patients under a tent outside the bus and ask patients about any potential COVID-19 symptoms or recent contact with infected individuals. Nurses also patiently describe side effects they might experience after the vaccine, usually a sore arm and mild fever, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Patients then head onto the Vaxi Taxi, where they receive their shots in the seats passengers have generally used for transportation. The Vaxi Taxi sports two tables that can be set up and put away with ease, seats for vaccine recipients, medical forms and equipment for vaccine distribution, and a team of friendly professionals.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/28/flag-garden-healing-touch-parade-ban-lifted-news-around-states/116658070/", "title": "Flag garden, healing touch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday vetoed legislation to delay next year’s requirement to hold back third graders who aren’t reading at grade level – a postponement lawmakers sought after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted classrooms. The veto means the promotion requirement will take effect at the end of the 2021-22 school year. The governor said it is “hasty and premature” to delay the requirement before education officials can review the newest test scores. “As a former teacher and even more so as governor, I believe early literacy is the gateway to all learning,” Ivey said in a statement. The Republican governor said she is asking the state superintendent to brief the public on spring test scores when available and for the Alabama Committee on Grade Level Reading to make recommendations regarding any future action. “Everyone agrees that the past 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been hard on all Alabamians, including school personnel, students and parents. However, to establish any delay at all in the Alabama Literacy Act prior to analyzing the 2020-2021 summative assessment data for reading would be hasty and premature,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city’s schools will be getting more than $112 million in funding from the latest round of federal coronavirus relief, and officials want the public to weigh in on how to spend it. The Anchorage School District received more $62 million from two prior rounds of federal pandemic aid and expects to get the latest disbursement as early as July, Alaska’s News Source reports. A school board town hall Wednesday night invited residents to offer input, and officials also distributed a survey in an effort to gather feedback.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Coconino County and its most populous city are dropping mask mandates they implemented last June to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Flagstaff Mayor Paul Deasy announced Tuesday that the city’s face-covering proclamation that took effect June 20 would end Wednesday, and the county Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to rescind the county’s mandate June 1. The county’s action affects only unincorporated areas, and any mask mandates imposed by local and tribal governments may still be enforced, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Deasy cited wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines and declining case numbers. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of the CDC and our local health departments and urge our residents to do the same,” Deasy said in a city statement. Businesses can still require face coverings and social distancing on private property, the statement said, and face coverings are still required on public transportation, at the airport and in other areas required by federal law.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A local business announced Wednesday that it has received federal emergency use authorization for its coronavirus antibody test that uses a drop of blood from a finger. The authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for use in moderate-complex settings and at the point of care. “The ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test is literally a lab at the tip of your finger, specifically designed to make diagnostic testing possible at home,” said Kevin Clark, chief executive officer of NOWDiagnostics Inc. “This EUA approval is the first step in making that a reality.” The rapid-results finger-stick test is not meant to find an active infection but can tell if a person has had COVID-19 and might still have some immunity. Because it’s entirely self-contained, the test can be done on the spot without a doctor, pharmacist or other trained professional with specialty equipment. The test would also not need to be sent to a lab for processing. During the emergency use authorization, however, it will only be used by trained professionals. The devices have been sent throughout the nation, and NOWDiagnostics in Springdale is on track to produce 2 million of the ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test devices per month. The facility now employs about 95 people. The company has 65 patents related to the device.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Disneyland fans won’t need an address in the Golden State to get into the park beginning June15. Disneyland and Disney California Adventure will welcome visitors from outside the state in mid-June, park officials said Wednesday. The park reopened in late April after a 412-day, pandemic-induced shutdown – but only to California residents. Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel, one of the on-site hotels, will also reopen that day, followed by iconic Disneyland Hotel on July 2. Disney said the state of California “strongly recommends” – but does not require – that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or obtain a negative coronavirus test before visiting. Face coverings, however, are required. Travelers need to have a ticket and theme park reservation for the same park on the same date.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: El Paso County agreed Tuesday to pay $65,000 to settle a federal lawsuit alleging that mismanagement by the sheriff led to a COVID-19 outbreak in the jail last year. The payment approved by county commissioners will cover attorneys’ fees paid by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit, The Gazette reports. Wellpath of Nashville, Tennessee, the company paid to provide health care in the Colorado Springs jail, will pay an additional $30,000 as part of the deal. In exchange, the ACLU agreed to drop the lawsuit without a finding a fault by Sheriff Bill Elder. Spokespeople for the sheriff’s office and Wellpath declined to comment on the settlement Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed after more than 1,000 inmates at the jail contracted COVID-19 last fall – the largest outbreak among jails and prisons in Colorado. It alleged that inmates were not given masks for months and were punished for making their own, which the ACLU said helped create a “mammoth, preventable” crisis. Jail officials have said they worked with county health officials to manage cases in the jail. They said they could not distribute masks initially because the only ones available had metal staples, which they said created unspecified safety concerns.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A week after lifting most COVID-19 restrictions in the state, Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday that his focus is now on getting people back into their offices and back to normal summer activities. Lamont joined other state officials and business leaders at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford to tout the state’s high vaccination rate and low coronavirus infection rate. “I have spent the last year-plus saying stay safe, stay home, and today I’m telling you, get out of the damn house, come enjoy Hartford, get on a plane, visit a restaurant, visit an amazing hotel,” he said. Connecticut has seen new cases go from a seven-day average of about 427 cases per day May 10 to just about 167 new cases, according to data from John’s Hopkins University. That’s down from more than 2,000 a day in January. More than 1.8 million residents have been fully vaccinated, and more than 60% have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the governor’s office. Connecticut Economic and Community Development Commissioner David Lehman said Connecticut’s economic activity is about 92% of what it was pre-pandemic, which ranks 19th in the nation. “So we are better than average, but we need to get that to 100%, and really we need to get that beyond 100%,” he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the coronavirus shutdown hit many nonprofit groups and community organizations hard, it also forced them to think of new ways to reach people, and that knowledge could propel them for years to come. “There are so many things we would have never done if it wasn’t for the pandemic,” said Mike Connolly, the executive director of the New Castle Historical Society. Before the shutdown, the group offered tours and programs at the Amstel House, Dutch House and Old Library and operated the Visitor Center at the Arsenal. COVID-19 meant the end to most indoor tours and adjusting other programs for social distancing. “Outdoor walking tours were an easy way to accommodate people during capacity restrictions,” Connolly said. The group was also able to open the historic gardens. But the key to staying relevant was being online. “We had to keep people aware that we’re here, and a lot of that had to go virtual,” Connolly said. “The biggest accomplishment was learning how to do things differently, getting out of our routine. It allowed us to expand the way we do things.” Before the pandemic, the society never held a webinar. “Suddenly we were attracting people from other states and other countries who couldn’t attend before,” Connolly said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Now that people can more freely travel just in time for Memorial Day weekend, the nonprofit organization Destination D.C. is expecting an increase in travelers to the city, WUSA-TV reports. “There are still free things to do in D.C., so this really has been our opportunity to really deliver that message,” said Theresa Belpulsi, vice president of tourism with Destination D.C. “I feel very confident about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, international travel will be slower to return until we open up the borders, but for the most part, we are focused on domestic visitation, and we look forward to a fantastic summer.” Museums and monuments consistently draw tourists to the D.C. area, and many of them will be back open this weekend. The Smithsonian will reopen 10 of its museums on a staggered schedule throughout the summer, marking a full reopening of the institution since closing to the public in March 2020. The museums will maintain additional COVID-19 safety measures, and many require visitors to reserve free, timed-entry passes before arriving. According to Tourism Economics, visitor spending in the district fell more than $6 billion last year. That meant a loss of about $477 million in tax revenue from visitor spending.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: One of the world’s top electronic music festivals is returning to downtown Miami next year with the blessing of neighbors who have complained about the event in the past. Organizers of the Ultra Music Festival on Tuesday announced an agreement to settle tensions with the Downtown Neighbors Alliance, the Miami Herald reports. The association representing 13 downtown condominium towers will no longer seek to remove the event from Bayfront Park. Ultra said in a statement that it would address issues like construction schedules, park closures, noise monitoring and traffic management. Festival organizers and residents found a balance between protecting local lifestyles and hosting large-scale music productions, Ultra spokesman Ray Martinez said. He suggested the event being canceled the past two years might have helped negotiations. “Maybe the COVID pause gave both sides an opportunity to kind of take a breath, if you will, and come to the table without the impending event looming over either side,” Martinez said. Ultra was set to return to downtown Miami in March 2020, but a nationwide coronavirus lockdown going into effect just days before the festival forced its cancellation. The event was postponed for another year this past March, set to return in 2022.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Doctors are seeing an uptick in accidental overdoses in children in the area, said Dr. Brian Coleman, medical director of the pediatric emergency room at the Memorial Health Dwaine & Cynthia Willett Children’s Hospital of Savannah. Coleman said the children’s ER has seen about 15 cases since opening in March – roughly double the normal rate. Commonly ingested drugs are opioids and marijuana-infused foods. “It may be that with the pandemic, and people being in the house more, it just provides more opportunity for kids to explore,” he said. “And you know, kids are like little bloodhounds, and they will find stuff on the floor and under couches.” For some drugs, even “one pill can kill,” Coleman said, though none of the recent accidental overdoses resulted in a fatality. “A dose of a standard oxycodone or Percocet or any type of those opioid medications, one pill is enough to suppress the child’s breathing, suppress their mental status, to where it can be life-threatening,” he said. Sam Wilson, program coordinator of Safe Kids Savannah, urges parents, grandparents and other caregivers to keep all medications in child-proof packaging or a lock box and out of children’s reach. Wilson agreed the pandemic may have played a role in the increase by bringing together caregivers and kids in new settings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials are preparing to announce new incentives for people to get vaccinated. “It’s going to be big, and it’s going to be generous,” Lt. Gov. Josh Green said. “Probably about a week or two from now, I would expect some of these fun announcements to come.” While details are thin, Hawaii News Now reports officials with the Hawaii Restaurant Association and the Retail Merchants of Hawaii said they were asked to find businesses willing to participate. Green said he is also planning to try to get participation from Las Vegas, often referred to as Hawaii’s ninth island, to join. “My team is going to reach out to some hotels over in Las Vegas and see if they’d be willing to offer some nights over on the ninth island,” Green said. Hawaii has administered about 1.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Green said the state hopes to get about 2 million shots in arms. “So these last 500,000 doses are going to be a little bit more difficult,” he said. Department of Health spokesperson Brooks Baehr said members of the business community “are taking the lead in this effort to work with the Department of Health and provide incentives that may engage and excite people.” Several other states have already launched incentive programs. Green said Hawaii’s incentive program is being vetted by attorneys.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With the governor out of the state, Idaho’s lieutenant governor issued an executive order Thursday banning mask mandates in schools and public buildings, saying such directives threatened people’s freedom. Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin is acting governor while Gov. Brad Little is at the Republican Governors Association conference in Nashville, Tennessee. He was expected to return Thursday evening. Last week, McGeachin announced her run for governor, challenging the first-term incumbent Little. McGeachin is on the far right of the political spectrum in the conservative state, and her order could bolster her support as a candidate for governor. Little’s office said McGeachin did not make him aware that she planned to issue the executive order. The office didn’t say what Little would do when he returned but said residents value local control. “Throughout the pandemic, Gov. Little has been committed to protecting the health and safety of the people of Idaho and has emphasized the importance of Idahoans choosing to protect our neighbors and loved ones and keeping our economy and schools open,” said Little’s spokeswoman, Marissa Morrison. Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but some counties, cities and schools did. Many have been lifting the mandates.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: COVID-19 vaccines will be available to Memorial Day weekend travelers up and down Illinois. The state announced clinics at Union Station in Chicago and four TravelCenters of America locations in Mount Vernon, Troy, Effingham and Bloomington. Wally’s and Hy-Vee are also offering a clinic for travelers along Interstate 55 near Pontiac. Travelers will be offered the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In addition to the weekend clinics, more than 1,000 locations in Illinois offer COVID-19 vaccines. They’re listed at coronavirus.illinois.gov. “Memorial Day weekend travelers will have yet another chance to join the more than 6 million Illinoisans who have gotten vaccinated,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is directing all state employees to return to their offices by early July. Gov. Eric Holcomb told state workers that the transition from a March 2020 stay-at-home order starts with senior staff, who must return by June 7. Other employees should spend at least 50% of their time at the office by June 21 and return full time by July 6. Staffers for many state agencies have been working remotely, but Holcomb said in a Wednesday email to employees that “it is not the optimal way for us to serve Hoosiers.” “We work better together, and build more solid and collaborative teams, when we can have regular face-to-face conversations,” Holcomb said. “Returning to the office means the impromptu discussions that so often lead to innovation will be happening again with more frequency and energy.” The state will offer a vaccination clinic at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis on June 21-22. About 2.4 million Indiana residents were considered fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, although the state’s vaccination rate is the 14th lowest in the country at about 35% of total population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most of the state’s counties declined any more COVID-19 vaccine for this week amid a slack in demand, and an official in a county with one of the lowest vaccination rates said Wednesday that she has given up arguing with people to get shots. Iowa Department of Public Health officials said based on demand from counties, the state ordered just 7,850 doses of vaccine for this week, with 81 of its 99 counties ordering none at all. Only Johnson County in eastern Iowa reported more than half of its population fully vaccinated, at 53.2%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Polk County, the state’s most populous, has fully vaccinated 43.5% of the population. The three counties with the lowest vaccination rates are on the state’s southern border with Missouri, including Wayne County, with 29.7%. Wayne County Public Health Administrator Shelley Bickel said in the past she has tried to convince people to get vaccinated, but she’s stopped those attempts. “They’ll sit and argue with you. We’re just tired of fighting,” she said. “We’re not pushing anyone. We figure if you want it, you can get it.” She attributed resistance to conservative residents, many of whom have long declined to wear masks or get vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After a year of operating virtually because of the pandemic, the city’s Wheelhouse Incubator program is returning full force for a 2021 summer session. The Wheelhouse Incubator, hosted by GO Topeka, is a 12-week course designed to help entrepreneurs scale up their businesses through strategic education, networking and mentoring opportunities. “This spring/summer session will provide established entrepreneurs with the invaluable experiences and connections to take their business to the next level,” said Karen Christilles, the program’s director. According to Christilles, the program expects to enroll about a dozen business owners in the session. It’s expected to kick off June 14 and last through late August, with participants meeting from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. every other Monday. The cost of the program is $600 and can be spread out over multiple payments. Some scholarships are available, according to the program’s webpage. Topeka last held a Wheelhouse Incubator session in person in 2019 – the same year the program was introduced to the community through 712 Innovations.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: U of L Health announced Wednesday that it will require COVID-19 vaccines for all its workers by Sept.1, becoming the first major health care system in the state to declare it will make the shots mandatory. “We believe it’s time to step up and actually require the vaccine among all of our health care workers,” Tom Miller, CEO of U of L Health, said at a news briefing. Three U of L doctors and two nurses were the first in Kentucky to receive the vaccine when it arrived in December, and health officials said they have worked to make it accessible to employees as well as people throughout the community. LaShawn Scott was among the first five U of L Health workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “As a nurse, I think it’s important that we keep ourselves safe as we care for these patients and minimize the risk of transmission to our co-workers and our community,” she said at Wednesday’s briefing. Miller said he sees little difference in requiring a COVID-19 vaccine and an annual flu shot already required for U of L health workers. He said workers without a religious or medical exemption who refuse the vaccine would be subject to disciplinary action but didn’t specify the nature of any such action. U of L estimates more than 70% of its 12,000 workers have already been inoculated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: All-night alcohol sales are coming back, and a ban on parades is being lifted, as vaccination rates improve and as hospitalizations from COVID-19 stay low, the city announced Wednesday. Current rules require that alcoholic beverage sales end at 1 a.m. That changes under rules that take effect Friday, the city said in a news release. The latest changes mean more money-making opportunities for the tourist-dependent city that saw hotels, restaurants and bars hit hard during the pandemic. The city announced it will begin taking permit applications for large parades and smaller “second line” processions under the new rules. Parades are a vital part of many New Orleans celebrations, most notably during Mardi Gras season. Second lines, smaller processions so named because watchers often join the procession to form a second line behind the band, take place year-round – a familiar scene after weddings, funerals or other events. The city is also allowing gyms to operate at full capacity and removing 6-foot table spacing requirements at restaurants. There remain some restrictions on the number of people allowed at large gatherings. But exceptions are to be made for events where masks are required or where participants provide proof of vaccinations.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials are not planning to develop a statewide vaccine passport system for recipients of COVID-19 shots. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said such a system would be a challenge because of questions such as how it would work across state lines and how the state would protect residents’ privacy. She said Wednesday that Maine isn’t looking to create one. The state supports private businesses that want to request COVID-19 vaccine verification, Lambrew said. She said businesses should make sure any verification systems they use are in line with state laws. “At this time there are no state of Maine policies that would have one set of rules for people who are vaccinated and another for those who are not,” Lambrew said. Residents who travel this summer are encouraged to bring their immunization record card if they need it, as well as a mask, Lambrew said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore City Schools won’t require tens of thousands of students failing classes this year amid challenges posed by the pandemic to repeat a grade in the fall. Instead, Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said, schools will give students additional time and customized instruction plans to make up gaps. News outlets report the decision was announced at a school board meeting Tuesday night and in emails to parents and teachers. No school board vote is required. About 65% of secondary students and 50% of elementary students in the system are failing at least one class, according to the school system. Testing will determine what students have missed, and a catch-up plan will be developed. The grading system is also being changed. Elementary students with an “unsatisfactory” grade in a course and middle school students with a failing grade will get a “not completed.” High school students with a failing grade will get a “no credit.” Dabrowksi told the school board that officials want to signal “a hopeful space for our young people and our commitment as educators to wrap around them when we bring them back.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A memorial flag garden on the Boston Common that honors every service member from Massachusetts who has died in war is back in its full glory this year. Fully vaccinated health care workers, military members and other volunteers gathered on the Common on Wednesday to plant 37,000 small U.S. flags, each one representing a fallen service member dating to the Revolutionary War. Last year the flag garden was set up on a limited basis, with about 1,000 flags placed 6 feet apart because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The flag garden, now in its 12th year, is organized by the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund and Home Base, a partnership of the Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital that supports veterans. Meanwhile, the state’s casinos and slots parlors will be able to welcome gamblers under nearly pre-pandemic conditions beginning this weekend. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to end its COVID-19 restrictions. That means beginning Saturday, every slot machine and gaming table will be allowed to reopen. Visitors who have been fully vaccinated won’t have to wear a mask. The move comes as Gov. Charlie Baker has ordered all remaining COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted Saturday. The state’s face covering order will also be rescinded for most settings.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s reelection campaign – not a nonprofit fund – will pay for her flights to and from Florida, where she visited her ailing father in March. The disclosure Thursday came in a letter to a Republican lawmaker who had asked questions about the pandemic trip. A lawyer for the governor’s campaign and the fund said he learned from Detroit-based PVS Chemicals, which supplied the private jet, that it could not accept the $27,521 payment except from a candidate committee because it is not authorized to operate charter flights. In a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Steve Johnson, Christopher Trebilcock said PVS and the fund, Michigan Transition 2019, learned of a “miscommunication” between themselves over the source of payment due to media reports. He said Whitmer flew private, instead of commercial, for security reasons – citing death threats and noting an alleged plot to kidnap her over her COVID-19 restrictions. Her state security detail accompanied her. Their expenses will be covered by the campaign, lessening the burden on taxpayers, he said. “But for her elected office, the governor would not have incurred the security expenses for travel to see her ailing father on short notice,” Trebilcock said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz hopes giveaways including Minnesota State Fair tickets, fishing licenses and state park passes will help pick up the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations, which has slowed. The Democratic governor on Thursday announced that 100,000 people who are vaccinated between Memorial Day weekend and the end of June will be eligible to choose among nine vaccine reward options. The incentives also include college baseball tickets, amusement park passes and a $25 Visa card, among other options. Walz called the incentive program a “wonderful opportunity” to vaccinate more residents while coronavirus case numbers remain low and as more people head outdoors this summer. “All of those things are the perfect timing to get the last bunch of folks to get in and get vaccinated,” Walz said during a news conference Thursday. “Take advantage of the incentives that we’re offering, and get out and explore Minnesota. You, your family and your community will be safe, and you’ll get to see the great things that we have.” COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in recent weeks after a bump in cases last month driven by virus variants. State health officials reported zero deaths earlier this week for the third time this month, and daily deaths haven’t totaled more than 22 in months.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s second-largest school district is planning on 100% in-person learning during the coming academic year, after having classes online for more than half of the current school year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Jackson Public Schools Superintendent Errick Greene said some students had a harder time learning from home. “Our early learners require more individualized instruction that’s just really difficult to provide virtually,” Greene told WJTV. “Some of our scholars faced serious behavioral, social and emotional challenges due to the long periods of isolation.” To enter any building, people will still have their temperatures taken, and they must wear masks. Sports are expected to pick back up, but the Jackson schools will require each person at indoor events to wear a mask. “I want to see all sports come back,” said Cameron Frank, an upcoming junior at Forest Hill High School. “Football, basketball, everything else for that matter.” Isolation rooms will be set up for any students who arrive with COVID-19 symptoms or get sick during the day. The district has enough laptops to give one to each student if they catch the disease. Classrooms and school buses will also go through deep cleanings daily.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city announced Thursday that Mayor Ken McClure intended to withdraw the civil emergency declaration undergirding Springfield’s COVID-19 health regulations, such as occupancy restrictions and a public masking mandate. The city said in a news release that the withdrawal would be effective at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, just ahead of the 12:01 a.m. Friday effective date for the repeal of the ordinance containing the city’s coronavirus regulations. Missouri’s other larger communities, including Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, already dropped their mask mandates when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued more lenient guidance on masking for vaccinated people earlier this month. “I am very proud of our community and grateful that there no longer appears to exist a state of civil emergency,” McClure said in a statement. “We would not be at this point had it not been for our community’s brave, innovative and critical work in the battle against COVID-19. It has not been easy. Thank you.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A local massage therapist recently expanded her business, a move that has freed her up to do something she’s always wanted to do: give back. Olga Hall said she’ll begin scheduling free sessions. And because it’s been a rough pandemic, she’s starting with medical professionals. Once summer hits, she’d like to schedule some teachers, followed by law enforcement, firefighters and child care workers. Hall said her philosophy is that people should not be preoccupied by their pain. So far, Hall has brought on two therapists to Massage Therapy Studios. She’s starting her free massages slowly to avoid overloading them and herself. At first, Hall will have four 30-minute slots. Clients can sign themselves up or nominate someone else starting May 31. At the end of the week, Hall will choose four names and reach out to make appointments for the week of June 14. Sign-ups are online only at massagetherapystudios.com. The site will go live May 31. Those who are chosen can up their session to an hour for an extra $25, and there will be a waiting list in case of cancellations. Four people a month doesn’t seem like much, but Hall said she would like to increase that number once she knows what her staff can handle.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is reporting its lowest level of new coronavirus cases since last April, shortly after the pandemic began. State health officials said 521 virus cases were reported over the past week, which was down from the previous week’s 533 cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases also decreased over the past two weeks from 195.43 per day May 11 to 74.43 per day Tuesday. The state said there have now been 223,243 cases and 2,249 deaths linked to the virus in Nebraska since the pandemic began. Over the past week, five new deaths were reported. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Nebraska also remains low at 73. Across Nebraska, 807,878 people, or roughly 42% of the state’s population, have been vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: For the second month in a row, the state’s casinos reported $1 billion in house winnings in April, showing signs that tourism business is returning faster to pre-pandemic levels than some experts expected. The state Gaming Control Board said Thursday that last month’s overall “casino win” of nearly $1.04 billion was up a robust 11% compared with $936 million in April 2019. A comparison with a year ago wasn’t relevant because casinos statewide were closed from mid-March to early June 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Before those closures, casinos had taken in more than $1 billion for three consecutive months. They reached the $1 billion mark again this March. Michael Lawton, senior analyst for the regulatory board, said winnings ticked up slightly in April at properties in the key Las Vegas Strip resort corridor, while casinos in downtown Las Vegas and the remainder of Clark County tallied all-time record winnings for consecutive months. The Reno area recorded its highest casino winnings total since July 2008, and sports bet winnings statewide also set records in April, Lawton said. The state collected more than $79 million in revenue based on the April numbers, up from about $19,000 in April 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: All state-managed COVID-19 vaccination sites will be closing at the end of June, officials said Thursday. The sites will be closed Monday for Memorial Day. They will reopen Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and operate Mondays through Saturdays, only providing second-dose vaccinations, health officials said in a news release Thursday. Those sites will close June 30. “There are more than 350 locations across the state offering first-dose appointments and many locations offer walk-in service without the need for an appointment,” the news release said. Meanwhile, Nashua officials have approved ending the city’s mask ordinance. The Board of Aldermen opted to end the ordinance Tuesday, and it awaited a signature from Mayor Jim Donchess, The Telegraph of Nashua reports. Local businesses could still require workers and patrons to wear masks. The city’s Board of Health voted to recommend that the city lift its mask mandate. The city has had an ordinance in place since May 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Mask mandates may be waived at high schools sooner than elementary and middle schools in the fall because teens have a head start over younger kids on getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. A day after he said all students will likely be required to wear a mask come September, Murphy suggested Wednesday that mask rules for schools and even summer camps are more fluid as coronavirus numbers continue to drop, and federal guidance may change. “If the science suggested it, you can turn your mask guidance on a dime because it’s easy,” Murphy said at a briefing. “You just don’t wear this the next day. So stay tuned.” The remarks came with New Jersey on the cusp of lifting its indoor mask mandate Friday. One major exception is anywhere unvaccinated children congregate in large groups, such as schools, day care centers and camps. Because those 12 and older are eligible to be vaccinated, it would make sense to allow high school students to go maskless in the fall when full in-class instruction resumes, Murphy said. About 202,000 children ages 12 to 17 had been vaccinated in New Jersey as of Wednesday, according to state Health Department data.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces has announced its intent to resume regular Mass, including Sunday Eucharist, and reinstate the church’s general obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass. Services have been disrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. A dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been in place since public health orders and capacity restrictions drove parishioners to celebrate Mass online and in church parking lots. A revised public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in April allowed houses of worship to welcome congregations back at 100% capacity. The move followed U.S. Supreme Court decisions that enjoin states from enforcing capacity limits on churches that are more restrictive than other entities like factories and schools, the governor’s office said at the time. In a memo issued Tuesday, Bishop Peter Baldacchino said the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass will take effect Sunday, June 6. However, exceptions to the obligation remain in place for anyone who is sick or symptomatic or has recently been exposed to the coronavirus and for anyone with significant health risk factors or those caring for someone with such risk factors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the state Department of Labor will provide guidance to businesses that taking time off due to side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine shot will be covered under New York’s paid sick leave law. Cuomo said studies have shown some people have been leery of getting a shot because it could require them to take time off from work to recuperate. A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation among unvaccinated Americans showed 48% are concerned they “might need to miss work if the side effects of the vaccine make them feel sick for a day or more.” But he said the state will make sure that any sick time due to recovery from any vaccine will be paid time off. A news release from Cuomo’s office said workers could take “any necessary recovery period” to get back on their feet after their vaccines. During a news conference at Grand Central Terminal, he also noted that New York already has a regulation on the books, enacted as part of this year’s state budget, that requires employers to give workers four hours of time off to get a vaccine shot, one for each dose if needed. “I don’t want to suggest that there are side effects,” Cuomo said of the vaccine. “If that’s an issue for you, that issue is resolved. You won’t miss a day’s pay because of getting a vaccine.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House unanimously approved legislation Wednesday that aims to spend $750 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to install high-speed internet in rural and remote areas lacking it. The legislation would set aside $350 million in discretionary American Rescue Plan funds earmarked for North Carolina to expand a relatively new state broadband installation matching-funds program with internet providers and electric cooperatives. The bill also expresses the intent to use $400 million in the funds from Congress on a new program that gives counties the ability to put out bids for broadband expansion in underserved areas. Federal aid going to counties also would pay for those projects. The measure, which now goes to the Senate, meets goals of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in his proposal last week to spend $1.2 billion of money from the latest pandemic aid package on improving internet access. But his plan spends half of that money on things like subsidizing service costs, purchasing computer equipment for households lacking it and offering “digital literacy” training. Some Democrats said during floor debate that they wished Wednesday’s bill contained the service subsidies. Still, the legislation passed 109-0.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Corrections officials will ease some coronavirus visitation restrictions in state prisons next week. In-person prison visits had been limited to one adult since they resumed in late March. Beginning Tuesday, visitors will be allowed to bring up to three minors per visit. Visitors must test negative for the virus, and advance scheduling is still required. Visitors 6 years and older must still wear a mask, but it doesn’t have to be an N95 mask, as is required now. The changes come as the number of active coronavirus cases is decreasing in the state along with a slight increase in COVID-19 vaccinations, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The state Health Department confirmed 79 new cases from 2,043 tests completed Monday. No new deaths were reported Tuesday, for a fifth straight day. Forty-two virus patients remained hospitalized, up one from Monday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s tracking site shows North Dakota’s rate of total vaccine doses administered, at 79,438 people per 100,000 population, ranks 33rd in the nation among states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota had earlier been one of the top states. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has reported that the state has some of the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy in the nation.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After more than 10 months, the state will no longer produce a weekly county map to show how the coronavirus is spreading in all 88 counties. The map was intended as a warning system for communities and has served its purpose, Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud said. “We’re in a very different point in this pandemic, and the need for this kind of urgency has passed,” McCloud told reporters Thursday afternoon. The Ohio Public Health Advisory System was rolled out in early July by Gov. Mike DeWine as a tool to help Ohioans make decisions about events and activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The map shaded each county based on seven metrics, including the number of new cases per 100,000 residents and an increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms. The lowest level, yellow, meant “active exposure and spread” of the virus. The highest level, purple, indicated “severe exposure and spread.” Each color came with suggestions such as to “limit activities as much as possible.” But there were no state policies or mandates tied to a color. Some school districts, businesses and other organizations used the map to determine when to allow in-person contact. The map lost some of its usefulness as infections surged in November and December.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Fifty-two people got COVID-19 shots Wednesday outside a Feria Latina Supermarket – a location selected by the Oklahoma City-County Health Department for a pop-up clinic by monitoring several data trends. The store’s ZIP code lagged others in vaccination rates, and sewage surveillance showed the coronavirus was present at higher levels in the area compared with other parts of the county. Coupled with lower vaccine uptake among Hispanic residents, those reasons led health officials to land on the grocery store for a pop-up site. As of Tuesday, about 19% of Hispanic residents in Oklahoma County were fully vaccinated, and 24% had received a first dose. The Oklahoma City-County Health Department has taken COVID-19 vaccines on the road in an effort to bring the shots to those who might not otherwise seek one out or be able to get to a vaccine clinic. At the site Wednesday, some people going to pick up groceries took a detour to get their vaccines on their way in or out, said health department spokeswoman Molly Fleming. They had their pick of whichever shot they’d like: Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. The Feria Latina site saw a steady pace of vaccine-takers and was one of the department’s most successful pop-up clinics so far, Fleming said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Employment Department says in July it will start upgrading the obsolete computer system that pays jobless benefits. That would end a 12-year delay that caused a catastrophic breakdown in distributing aid during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The state’s new system won’t be in place until 2024. Oregon was among the slowest states in the nation at paying jobless benefits amid the pandemic, with laid-off workers frequently waiting weeks or months for aid. The employment department was hindered by a rigid computer system from the 1990s, which was unable to adapt to supplemental benefits Congress added last year. The huge volume of claims – Oregon has paid out more than $9 billion during the pandemic – meant months of delays. The state received $86 million in federal aid to upgrade its technology in 2009, but administrative failures in the employment department stopped the work from happening. The state still has almost all the money the federal government allocated for the upgrade. Past estimates have put the total cost for the project between $80 million and $123 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is lifting its mask mandate no later than June 28. The Department of Health announced Thursday that it will no longer require unvaccinated people to wear masks in public June 28 or once 70% of adults are fully vaccinated, whichever comes first. People are considered fully vaccinated once they are two weeks beyond their last required dose of COVID-19 vaccine. According to federal data, 70% of Pennsylvania residents 18 and over have already received at least one dose, with just over half the adult population fully inoculated. “What all of this means is that Pennsylvanians are realizing that they have the power to stop COVID-19 and that they are stepping up to get vaccinated. It also means that we are on track to get to 70% of all adults with second doses by the end of June,” Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said at a news conference Thursday. Businesses, schools and municipalities may still require people to wear masks, the Health Department said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also requires them on planes, trains, buses and public transportation hubs. With the pandemic in retreat, the state previously announced plans to lift nearly all mitigation orders on Memorial Day. New infections continue to fall rapidly.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The city has planted a living memorial to the almost 200 residents who have died after contracting the coronavirus. A tree and accompanying plaque were dedicated Monday outside city hall, WPRI-TV reports. “This tree will remain here for generations to come as a reminder of loved ones that are no longer with us,” Mayor Bob DaSilva said. The tree will be decorated during the holidays every year in their honor, he said. The plaque reads: “In memory of East Providence residents whose lives were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. May they rest in eternal peace.” The Rhode Island Department of Health on Thursday reported nearly 80 new confirmed cases but no virus-related deaths. The new cases were out of slightly more than 8,000 test results returned the prior day, for a positivity rate of less than 1%. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped to 65, according to the latest data, down from 70 the previous day. The number of people fully vaccinated against the disease in the state has now topped 544,000. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island has dropped over the past two weeks, from about 151 on May 11 to about 120 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are working to roll out pop-up vaccination clinics at beaches and festivals this summer, said Dr. Brannon Traxler, the state’s director of public health. One program would bring vaccine clinics to state parks, where people would get a free shot and park admission for the day, she said. Another plan is to partner with breweries to offer free beer for people who get a shot, Traxler said. The incentive effort is based on the success of similar programs in other states that have reached young people, one demographic that is lagging on inoculations. While there has been significant progress, COVID-19 remains a threat to people who have not been vaccinated, Traxler said. Indoor events including churches and movie theaters with lots of people are among the riskiest activities for those who have not been vaccinated while being safe for those who have, she said. For parents of children under 12, who are not eligible for the vaccination, going to places like that poses individual risks that are best assessed by each family, Traxler said. South Carolina has one of the lower vaccination rates in the nation. Only eight states, primarily in the Southeast, have lower rates. The nation recently passed 50% of adults having at least one COVID-19 shot. South Carolina’s rate is 44%.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Following suit with public schools and universities, officials with the city’s private schools and universities also don’t plan on mandating COVID-19 vaccines for students and staff when they return to classrooms this fall. Augustana University won’t require vaccinations for staff or students, said Suzie O’Meara Hernes, COVID-19 response coordinator for the school. The vaccine is a personal choice, Hernes said. However, in some cases, students will be required to get COVID-19 shots, such as a nursing student who is required by the hospital system for which they work in their clinical placement. Of the Augie community, staff and students, 64% have reported they’re fully vaccinated, Hernes said. Vaccine reporting is voluntary and relies on the individual to report, she noted, adding she believes the percentage is higher than reported. At the University of Sioux Falls, the university doesn’t require vaccines and won’t plan to this fall. USF was “blessed” to remain open for the duration of the 2020-21 academic year and is working toward a full “return to normal” for this fall, said Amy Johnson, USF COVID-19 response team leader. At the K-12 level, officials with Sioux Falls Christian Schools and Bishop O’Gorman Catholic Schools both say they’re not planning to require COVID-19 shots either.\n\nTennessee\n\nMaryville: A woman accused of driving through a COVID-19 vaccine distribution tent as a form of protest has been charged with seven counts of felony reckless endangerment, according to a police report. Virginia Christine Lewis Brown, 36, was arrested after a Blount County deputy witnessed her driving through the tent at a vaccine event Monday at Foothills Mall in Maryville, according to news outlets, which cited an incident report. The report said more than a dozen health department and National Guard personnel were inside the tent. “I had several victims tell me she almost hit them as she fled through the tent at high speeds,” the deputy wrote in the report. “I was advised that they were within inches and feet of the vehicle as it came through the tent. Several victims stated that they thought the driver was going to kill them.” After the deputy stopped Brown, she told him she drove through the site to protest the vaccine and was only traveling 5 miles per hour, the report said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Brown had an attorney.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Several nursing students are objecting to a policy at Driscoll Children’s Hospital requiring them to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to complete their clinical rotations. Severe reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have been rare; clinical trials have yielded efficacy results beyond what some medical professionals expected; and the mRNA technology used to make the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines has been decades in the making. Yet misinformation and distrust continue to surround the new vaccines, even within the health care field. Most of the students objecting to the requirement said they’re averse to getting a COVID-19 shot because the vaccines so far do not have full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA. One student said she contracted COVID-19 and tested positive for antibodies, suggesting that meant she didn’t need the vaccine. Experts have recommended that people who recovered from COVID-19 be vaccinated because it’s unclear how long immunity from a previous infection lasts. The students also say vaccine requirements run afoul of an order by Gov. Greg Abbott banning entities that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination under an emergency use authorization.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As the nation inches toward its vaccination goals, “COVID cabin fever” is beginning to lift. But for tourist-based communities like southern Utah, which before the pandemic was expecting its busiest season yet, “post-COVID is a whole world that is just as mysterious as early COVID was,” Washington County Commissioner Gil Almquist said. The effects of overtourism have also returned. Park officials have reported unprecedented levels of vandalism and human waste in Arches and Zion National Parks. Scenes showing long lines of idling traffic clogging up roadways have become commonplace. Officials and advocates statewide have long seen overtourism as a real threat, but the bustling summer crowds brought on by the pandemic have sent them scrambling to figure out ways to manage it while still supporting the locals who depend on tourism dollars. Of the five Utah national parks, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Arches National Parks all had their highest-ever visitation levels in 2018. Canyonlands National Park made its record in 2016, and Zion National Park, the third most visited park in the country, hit a peak of 4.5 million visitors in 2017. Utah Office of Tourism Director Vicki Varella said travel this summer will mimic trends seen before the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: All of Vermont’s state parks will be open for Memorial Day weekend. Some opened in the beginning of May, but by Friday, all 55 will be open, WCAX-TV reports. Following a surge in visitors last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, park officials expect to have one of the busiest seasons ever, said state parks director Nate McKeen. “People understand being outside is one of the safest places to be, and it’s the best place possible for your mental and physical health, and then they get out and see our state parks,” he said. While many campsites are full, and others are going quickly, visiting a state park for the day is also an option, said Vermont Forestry Commissioner Michael Snyder. Day visits make up half of the usage of Vermont State Parks. “We kind of like to think of our parks as everyone’s lake house, remote camp. You don’t have the property taxes, you don’t have to maintain them, you pay a small fee, and you are good to go,” McKeen said.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: The city reported the highest unemployment rate in the state, according to a new equity dashboard from Virginia’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Petersburg’s 14.9% jobless rate in January 2021 was nearly three times the average across Virginia. And it was 4 percentage points higher than second-worst Emporia’s 10.9%. “If you are unemployed, and you don’t have financial resources, then it makes all of those social determinants of health that much more complicated,” said Janice Underwood, chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer for the commonwealth. Unemployment skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic as millions of workers were laid off or furloughed as a result of state-mandated closures. Virginia’s highest statewide unemployment rate in the past 14 months was 11% in April 2020. Fortunately, the state has been in decline, ranking at a rate of 5.7% in January. Following the declaration of racism as a public health crisis, the state embarked on creating two dashboards to provide information in hopes of addressing the various health disparities. The Equity-in-Action dashboard reflects the progress the state has made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the Equity-at-a-Glance dashboard focuses on various social disparities, like food distribution and Medicaid.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city is shutting down all but one of its mass COVID-19 vaccination sites next month because authorities say more than 76% of Seattle residents eligible have received at least one shot, and 60% are fully vaccinated. Authorities announced Wednesday that the city-run sites at Lumen Field, Rainier Beach, West Seattle and North Seattle College will close in June. The Seattle Times reports the Seattle Fire Department will continue operating its testing and vaccination site in the SODO neighborhood south of downtown through the summer. “Now that the vast majority of Seattleites have begun the vaccination process, we are able to safely reopen and recover as a city – without the need for our fixed sites,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement. The city’s vaccination efforts got a boost when the Lumen Field Event Center opened more than two months ago. Since March 13, more than 97,000 vaccinations have been administered at the event center near two of the city’s large sports arenas. The city says it will continue to offer mobile vaccinations and spin up vaccination clinics as needed. Seattle is outpacing the state with COVID-19 vaccinations. The state Department of Health’s data dashboard shows nearly 61% of residents 16 and older have gotten at least one shot, and more than 40% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office has reopened after being closed for more than a year because of the pandemic. Walk-up services now available to the public include certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said. The office, located in the Diamond building, is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. People who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are required to wear masks. Certificates are $12 each. Exact change is required if paying in cash, or customers may use a money order or check. Credit and debit cards are not accepted. The Vital Registration Office and Diamond building lobby closed to the public March 20, 2020, as the coronavirus began to spread widely in the United States.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of COVID-19 deaths in the state has now surpassed 7,000, but data that shows the number of coronavirus cases declining and more people being vaccinated offer some hope after more than a year of the pandemic. The state Department of Health on Wednesday reported five new deaths and 330 new cases of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of 7,003 people in Wisconsin. The average number of daily new cases over the past seven days is 307. A week ago the average was 394 daily cases. As coronavirus cases in Wisconsin continue to decline, more residents are being vaccinated against COVID-19. A total of 5,087,871 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state as of Wednesday, with nearly 79% of Wisconsinites ages 65 and older having been fully vaccinated. About 16% of the state’s 12- to 15-year-olds have received their first doses of vaccine, according to health officials. That age group became eligible May 13.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to return to full capacity for home football games inside War Memorial Stadium this fall. University of Wyoming Athletic Director Tom Burman told the Casper Star-Tribune that fans, including students, won’t be required to be vaccinated in order to attend games. “It puts a smile on my face. It’s not just about money. It’s about the experience,” Burman said. “I watched the PGA Championship the other day, and I watched people following Phil (Mickelson), and I thought, ‘That’s what it’s all about.’ If we don’t return to that, I worry about the future of our sports. It’s not as appealing when there aren’t fans there.” Last season was shortened because of the coronavirus pandemic, and home attendance was initially capped at 7,000, then further reduced to 5,000, or 17% of the 29,181-seat stadium’s capacity. University officials worked with the state Department of Health to determine attendance figures based on the virus’s local impact at that time. The attendance plan for the fall could change depending on the data between now and the start of the upcoming season in September, Burman said, adding that he does not expect that to be the case.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/12/13/upcoming-concerts-phoenix-billy-joel-post-malone-cardi-b-travis-scott/2268202002/", "title": "Upcoming concerts in Phoenix: Billy Joel, Post Malone, Tori Kelly", "text": "Billy Joel brings his hits to the ballpark in a season that also features a star-studded Pot of Gold Festival with Post Malone and Lil Wayne, the return of Justin Timberlake and Meek Mill.\n\nHere's a look at those and other highlights of the winter concert season.\n\n2/26: Muse\n\nAmong the more ambitious stadium-rock sensations to emerge from the shadow of Radiohead with two best-British-live-act trophies from the Brit Awards to show for it, they arrive in support of \"Simulation Theory.\" Phoenix is the third date on the tour.

City Walk BHAM will be located under Interstate 59/20, which was recently rebuilt and lies between the main downtown area and the city’s civic center, indoor arena and new football stadium, which is opening this fall. Construction began recently, and officials hope the project will be done by July 2022, when Birmingham will host the World Games, an international sporting event.

Lisa Murkowski, who has been one of the GOP’s most outspoken critics of former President Donald Trump, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The Alaska Republican State Central Committee endorsed Kelly Tshibaka in the 2022 race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Murkowski. The committee approved Tshibaka’s endorsement in a 58-17 vote during a meeting in Fairbanks, the newspaper reports. In a statement, Tshibaka said she will uphold conservative ideals and be a senator who Alaskans “can depend to make every decision based on what is best for our great state.” Tshibaka, who ran the Alaska Department of Administration, announced March 29 that she would run for the Senate seat held by Murkowski, who has been in office since 2002. On March 13, the Republican State Central Committee voted 53-17 to censure Murkowski, citing her vote to impeach Trump and other votes that have broken with GOP leadership. Alaska Republican Party leaders said at the time that they would recruit someone to run against her. Trump has endorsed Tshibaka. “Lisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,” the former president said in a statement last month. “Murkowski has got to go!”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A Boy Scout council that serves most of the state plans to sell its main summer camp near Payson and part of a Phoenix facility to help the national organization settle claims by thousands of victims of child sex abuse. The Phoenix-based Grand Canyon Council said it will sell Camp Geronimo and 10 acres of Heard Scout Pueblo and shift its summer camp operations to Camp Raymond near Flagstaff. “This option leverages the high net value of Camp Geronimo and the rising real estate values in Arizona against our program needs; we will retain the most-used portion of the Heard while giving up the portion under-utilized by us yet highly valued to others,” the council said Wednesday on its website. The council said it must contribute just over $7 million toward the settlement and reviewed its options carefully. “The process has been difficult and at times emotional, as everyone has strong ties to our various camps, and each is loved for its own special characteristics.” The council serves most of central and northern Arizona. The Tucson-based Catalina Council serves most of southern Arizona, while parts of northwestern and northeastern Arizona are served by councils based respectively in Las Vegas and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The authenticity of a United Nations designation that was given to the city by an artist is now being questioned.

Alao, who is a guest artist in residence with a nonprofit group in nearby Rogers, said the U.N. declaration is given to cities that support the arts. Alao is described as a U.N. art ambassador. But Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general of the U.N., said he is not aware of an “ambassador of the arts” in the organization. He also said the U.N. does not designate cities with the title Alao gave Fort Smith. “This has all the hallmarks of a scam,” Dujarric told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He said the U.N. legal team has been notified of the situation. Asked Friday about Dujarric’s statement, Alao said it was simply his assessment. He said the word “designation,” which Dujarric used and has been used in news articles to describe the declaration, is misleading: “It’s just a declaration, which is my assessment of what a city is doing to foster the arts, use the arts as a tool for economic development and peace building.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nIndio: Thomas Rhett, Carrie Underwood and Luke Combs are slated to headline the return of the Stagecoach Festival next spring. Other festival highlights include Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and country legend Tanya Tucker on Friday, April 29, masked country singer Orville Peck and alternative country vocalist Margo Price on Saturday, April 30, and rock band The Black Crowes and Motown legend Smokey Robinson on Sunday, May 1. A summer announcement is unusual, as the lineup is typically released in October. Los Angeles-based producer Goldenvoice announced on the Stagecoach Twitter last week that it was forgoing an advance sale in lieu of an early lineup release. Both Coachella and Stagecoach were postponed twice before the April 2021 dates were canceled. Some fans hoped the festivals would be rescheduled for October, as the city of Indio has a contract with Goldenvoice that allows for five concerts each year. Rhett and Underwood were announced as headliners for the 2020 festival, along with Eric Church. The previous lineup also included Billy Ray Cyrus, ZZ Top and Alan Jackson and Bryan Adams.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Ahead of Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game this week, city officials are facing scrutiny from advocates who accuse them of accelerating the clearing of homeless encampments near Coors Field as the sports world turns its attention to Colorado’s capital city. Mayor Michael Hancock has emphatically denied that the All-Star Game influenced any clearing decisions, saying the city is just getting caught up after suspending cleanups at the beginning of the pandemic. It resumed regular cleanups last summer. Officials knew before the city was chosen as the All-Star host that it faced a big cleanup effort, with more encampments than ever, Hancock said. In cleanups, also called homeless “sweeps,” encampments are fenced off, and the people living in tents there are told to pack up and leave so the area can be cleaned. In March, just before Denver was chosen as a substitute host – Major League Baseball pulled it from Atlanta in April over objections to Georgia’s voting law that critics condemned as being too restrictive – data shows sweeps increased, with cleanups taking place over nine days. The previous peak over the past year was eight days, in October. But the sweeps picked up even more in May and June with 17 scheduled cleanups taking 22 days, according to public records first reported by online news outlet Denverite.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Lyme: Six National Guard soldiers were sent to the hospital for observation Monday after experiencing heat-related issued during a training march. Maj. Dave Pytlik, a spokesperson with the Connecticut National Guard, said the soldiers were among several dozen participating this week in officer training school at the Guard’s Stone’s Ranch Military Reservation in East Lyme. Monday is what is known as “ruck march” day, when the soldiers carry heavy backpacks on a rigorous 6-mile training march, he said. Pytlik said medical personnel, including a doctor, were on hand as part of precautions for the early morning march and responded appropriately to treat those suffering dehydration and other heat-related symptoms. “The issue is that someone came on the network and used the term ‘mass-casualty incident’ and said someone was unresponsive,” he said. “There was nobody who was unresponsive, and mass-casualty kind of means something different in the world than it means to us.” He said the six soldiers were taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London for observation, but nobody was seriously injured. Pytlik said minor injuries and dehydration are relatively common issues during training marches.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles is turning its operations back to pre-COVID-19 “normal” conditions. That means DMV buildings will return to full capacity, among other changes. The Delaware State News reports the changes will be made Tuesday after Gov. John Carney’s state of emergency declaration is lifted. Starting Tuesday, mask recommendations will follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Customers who have not been fully vaccinated will be encouraged to continue wearing face coverings while at the DMV. Driver license and vehicle registration suspensions for bad checks will also resume. So will uninsured motorist customer notifications for any outstanding balance owed to the DMV. Class D road tests and counter eye exams are also set to resume. Specific guidance will be in place from the Delaware Division of Public Health to protect both customers and staff. Marinah Carver, chief of communications for DMV, said staff is to be commended for its service to the public during the pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Drivers who frequent Rock Creek Park’s Beach Drive during late mornings and early afternoons will need to reroute themselves to accommodate an extensive renovation project, WUSA-TV reports. As of Monday, the segment of Beach Drive between Shoreham Drive and Tilden Street Northwest will be closed to traffic daily between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., according to D.C.’s Department of Transportation. The closures will remain in effect until at least Dec. 20. The detours are part of the city’s larger 3.7-mile renovation project that will consolidate the existing paths into part of the Rock Creek Park Multi-Use Trail and Pedestrian Bridge project. This includes the addition of a 110-foot bridge south of the Smithsonian National Zoo tunnel that will reroute foot and bike traffic off the existing narrow footpath that flows directly adjacent to traffic inside the current tunnel. DDOT expects the entire trail renovation to be completed sometime in spring 2023. The rehabilitation process comes nearly three years after a trail adjacent to the National Zoo collapsed following extreme flooding. Foot and bike traffic have subsequently been forced to use the narrow sidewalk in the Beach Drive tunnel.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade County Courthouse will begin undergoing repairs immediately after a review, prompted by the deadly collapse of a nearby condominium building, found that safety concerns exist within the courthouse, officials said. A joint statement from multiple leaders released late Friday said an engineer’s report recommended floors 16 and above be closed to staff at the courthouse. The leaders decided all courthouse employees would go back to working from home. The statement said workers only recently returned to the building after working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Court operations will go back to a remote format until the safety concerns are addressed. People with upcoming court proceedings scheduled to take place in person will be receiving a new notice with instructions, the statement said. Specific details about what repairs are needed were not disclosed. The courthouse was built in 1928 and added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1989, news outlets report. The building has 28 floors. The building underwent a review following the collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, where the toll is likely to top 100.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: A new initiative at the Mercer University School of Medicine conceived by a retired federal judge is helping poor people in rural Georgia erase their medical debt. The Mercer Family Cares Initiative, funded by three families with ties to the university, is retiring more than $4.3 million in medical debt for nearly 3,000 people who live in 33 Georgia counties, according to a news release from the university. The idea came from retired U.S. District Judge William Duffey, who served in the northern district of Georgia and was previously a partner at King & Spalding law firm in Atlanta, after he noticed inflated prices for items on his own medical bills. He did some research and found that the system is needlessly confusing and fraught with undue and unreasonable expenses, particularly for those who are least able to pay. “I’ve always wondered how people navigate the system, especially those who didn’t have the patience, time or resources,” Duffey said in the news release. Mercer’s medical school works on issues related to access to medical care in rural Georgia, and Duffey reached out to two friends who had graduated from Mercer Law, one a current university trustee and one a former trustee, to see about helping to resolve medical debt for people living in poverty.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A nonprofit organization that serves and advocates for the Micronesian and Pacific islander communities plans to open a youth center in Honolulu this month. The center will offer college and career prep, cultural exhibitions, mentorship programs and study areas, We Are Oceania CEO Josie Howard told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. It will have resources for homeless youth and families, she said. “Just like a home means everything to a family, this center will be the same,” Howard said. “It’s a place where they can come and seek help. Somebody is there to help, and somebody is there who understands them.” The Youth Empowerment Center, the first of its kind for We Are Oceania, is located inside a former American Savings Bank branch in Liliha that offered the space to the nonprofit rent-free. University of Hawaii at Manoa undergraduate K-nard Narruhn, who is Chuukese, is recruiting youth mentors and said he is excited to continue working as one himself. The 22-year-old who helps organize and run food drives, vaccination clinics, translation services, and unemployment and housing support remembers getting help from We Are Oceania after he dropped out of high school and was going from job to job feeling unfulfilled. Narruhn earned his high school equivalency diploma and enrolled in college, making the dean’s list.\n\nIdaho\n\nBuhl: A far-right extremist group whose members took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol participated with a float in the town’s July 3 parade. The Times-News reports Proud Boys members were among about 100 floats in the Sagebrush Days parade. The Buhl Chamber of Commerce runs the parade but wouldn’t comment specifically about the Proud Boys taking part. “At this time the Buhl Chamber (of) Commerce will not feed into any negative propaganda,” the group said in a statement to the newspaper. “The Buhl 2021 Sagebrush Days parade saw 90 plus entries who celebrated in a courteous and civil manner.” Chamber officials later told the paper they were looking into the process for reviewing parade entries. On Jan. 6, the Proud Boys marched to the Capitol before then-President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. The insurrectionists who descended on the Capitol sent terrified lawmakers running for their lives. Twin Falls County, where Buhl is located, overwhelmingly voted for Trump. In Buhl, men accompanying the Proud Boys float wore black and yellow shirts while carrying an American flag and a black flag with the yellow letters “P.B.” “I was surprised as anyone else to see that particular float go by,” said Buhl City Councilman Michael Higbee. Idaho has a history of far-right groups. The neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations was based near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho starting in the 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: A Southern Illinois University researcher is tracking coyotes and bobcats to understand the habitats they seek and how they affect them. Nicole Gorman, a graduate zoology student and a research assistant at SIU’s Wildlife Research Laboratory in Carbondale, is studying the movement of bobcats and coyotes in central and southern Illinois. Such midsize predators dominate North America, and it’s critical to understand their impact, she said. “Studying predator movement specifically can provide scientists with more details about their behavior and how they might be interacting with their environments and other species around them,” Gorman said. “This understanding can lead to effective wildlife management, benefiting predator and prey species alike.” Since starting in November 2019, Gorman has captured and tagged 33 of the animals at sites near Makanda and Lake Shelbyville. She said she traps them safely with foothold or cage traps and fits them with GPS transmitters to follow them. She studies the incoming data to determine habitats they like and those they avoid. She also reviews their interaction with deer as part of a project on white-tailed deer movement sponsored by the U.S. Wildlife Restoration Fund and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. She’s found coyotes and bobcats in heavily forested southern Illinois need not travel far to sustain themselves, but in the more agricultural central Illinois, their range can exceed 200 square miles.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of abortions performed in the state grew slightly last year, with a new report showing drug-induced abortions made up a majority of the procedures for the first time. The annual report from the state health department shows that the number of abortions in Indiana grew by 119, or 1.6%, to 7,756 during 2020. That increased number remained below the some 8,000 performed in 2018, Indiana’s highest total since 2014. Drug-induced abortions represented 55% of Indiana’s total, up from 44% during 2019 and about double the state’s rate from 2016. Indiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature passed a law this year aimed at requiring doctors to tell women undergoing such abortions about a disputed “abortion reversal” treatment for potentially stopping the process. That law, however, was blocked by a federal judge just before it was set to take effect July 1. Indiana recorded about 79,000 live births last year. Indiana Right to Life President Mike Fichter blamed the abortion increase on several anti-abortion laws passed by state legislators being blocked by federal courts. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Nicole Erwin said the COVID-19 pandemic added pressure to many women facing unintended pregnancies, and making contraception more accessible and affordable was the best way to reduce such pregnancies.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Efforts to reduce overcrowding in the state’s prisons have been continued into a second year after beginning in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to new data from the state. As of June 14, Iowa’s prison population was 7,744 people, the Legislative Service Agency reported. That’s an increase of only 52 people compared to the previous year, a change of less than 1%. In comparison, there were nearly 9,000 people in the state’s prisons in 2011. Since then, 2014 was the last time fewer than 8,000 Iowans were in state prison at the end of the fiscal year. The current numbers mean about 245 out of each 100,000 Iowans are behind bars. The number was last that low in the late 1990s, according to a report from the Prison Policy Initiative. The Legislative Service Agency’s report uses data from the Iowa Department of Corrections and compares Iowa’s prison population, including admissions and releases, in the 2020 and 2021 budget years. The Legislative Service Agency attributed some of the decline in Iowa’s prison population, admissions and releases to COVID-19 mitigation policies. The Iowa Department of Corrections worked with the Iowa Board of Parole and community-based corrections to transition “as many inmates as possible” to community supervision to reduce prison populations, according to the report.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health officials are investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 cases at a summer camp in Butler County, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced last week. Thirteen cases were reported in the past two weeks and 23 cases overall at the AGK Ministries summer camp at the Wheat State Retreat Center near Maize held June 21-25, the KDHE reports. State and Butler County health officials are investigating and urging anyone who attended the camp to be tested for the coronavirus. The camp is one of four camps listed by the state Thursday as COVID-19 cluster locations based on cases in the prior 14 days. The others are Christ the King Summer Camp and Early Education Center in Topeka, with nine cases; Moana Camp in Overland Park, with five cases; and West Central Christian Service Camp in the Johnson County town of Missouri, with seven cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A federal appeals court has ruled the state Department of Corrections can deny a life-saving medication for inmates with hepatitis C because it is expensive – a decision a dissenting judge said will condemn hundreds of prisoners to long-term organ damage and suffering. In a 2-1 ruling, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said last Tuesday that the department can deny the treatment, which cures nearly 100% of patients but costs $13,000 to $32,000. The majority found that denying it to most of Kentucky’s 1,200 inmates with hepatitis C does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. But in a sharply worded dissent, Judge Jane Stranch of Nashville said by “flouting the recognized standard of care,” the Corrections Department “consigns thousands of prisoners with symptomatic, chronic HCV to years of additional suffering and irreversible liver scarring.” She said by withholding medical treatment until the damage has progressed too far to be reversible, Kentucky’s rationing plan “shocks the conscience” and is fundamentally unfair. Louisville attorney Greg Belzley, who represents prisoners in a class-action lawsuit, called the decision “horrendous” and said they would ask for a rehearing or petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Edwin Washington Edwards, the high-living, quick-witted four-term governor who reshaped the state’s oil revenues and dominated its politics for decades in a run all but overshadowed by scandal and eight years in federal prison, died Monday. He was 93. Edwards died of respiratory problems with family and friends by his bedside, family spokesman Leo Honeycutt said, days after entering hospice care at his home in Gonzales. “I’ve made no bones that I have considered myself on borrowed time for 20 years and we each know that all this fun has to end at some point,” Edwards said days before he died, according to his family’s statement. The “Cajun King” was known for delivering a steady supply of memorable one-liners as well as for his deft political instincts. Infamously, the lifelong Democrat said once said that the only way he could lose to a particularly lackluster Republican was if he were “caught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.” A native of Louisiana’s Acadiana region who swore his 1972 oath of office in French and English, Edwards enjoyed renewed popularity after emerging from prison in 2011 at age 83 with his flamboyant character intact. The federal case that led to his May 2000 conviction involved him taking payoffs from interests seeking riverboat casino licenses.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Endangered Atlantic salmon in the Kennebec River can be protected without removing four hydroelectric dams, federal energy regulators said, leaving conservation groups stunned. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reached the conclusion in a draft environmental assessment July 1 in the relicensing of one of four dams owned by the Canada-based Brookfield Renewables. The regulators said the fish can be protected and brought back to a population of at least 2,000, even if the Shawmut Dam in Benton injures or kills as many as 4% of them. That’s a lower bar than both conservationists and Maine’s Department of Marine Resources have called for. “It’s really bad. It’s incredibly bad,” said Nick Bennett, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Council of Maine, told Maine Public. FERC assessment also failed to meet fish passage standards recommended by its sister agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, he said. “Both National Marine Services and the Department of Marine Resources recommended dam removal. FERC completely ignored that,” he said. In a statement, a Brookfield spokesman said FERC’s proposed conditions are consistent with most of the company’s own recommendations, including the completion of a fish-lift at the Shawmut dam.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A software glitch in some parking kiosks may have cost the city as much as $20,000 in revenue. Flowbird, which runs kiosks in downtown Ocean City, had performed a software update July 1 that led to some customers being charged multiple times, Ocean City spokeswoman Jessica Waters said. When city officials learned of the problem, they shut down paid parking July 5-6. Waters said that resulted in a revenue loss that has been estimated to be as much as $20,000. The problem also affected other communities with Flowbird kiosks, including Rehoboth Beach in Delaware. Flowbird has since resolved the problem and is issuing refunds, Vice President of Marketing Sean Renn said. He said that there were no security violations or hacks and that all customer data is safe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The U.S.S. Constitution is returning to its full summer visitation hours this week for the first time in more than a year. Starting Tuesday, the warship known as “Old Ironsides” will be open for free public tours from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. The ship suspended public visits in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic but reopened on a limited basis last August. After a second shutdown, it reopened with limited visitation hours in May. Visitors are allowed to freely explore the top three decks of Old Ironsides and hear active-duty Navy sailors explain the ship’s 223-year history. The ship welcomed more than 600,000 guests in 2019. The U.S.S. Constitution is the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat. It played a crucial role in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812, actively defending sea lanes from 1797 until 1855. The ship was undefeated in battle and destroyed or captured 33 enemy vessels. It earned its nickname during the War of 1812 when British cannonballs bounced off its wooden hull.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republicans’ attempts to add an ID component to absentee ballot applications and to institute signature verification at polling places have died in the GOP-led Legislature, amid pushback from election clerks and voting-rights advocates. Rep. Ann Bollin, who chairs the House Elections and Ethics Committee, said she and many other House Republicans oppose a Senate-passed bill that would require absentee ballot applicants to include a copy of their photo ID, their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Those who do not would get a provisional ballot and have to either verify their voter registration or their identity and residence within six days after the election for it to count. “There was not support to make it more difficult for voters through the AV process,” said Bollin, of Brighton Township. Nearly 3.3 million people – a record – voted absentee in November. Voters currently seeking an absentee ballot by mail must sign the application, and the signature is matched to the voter file. The Senate, meanwhile, is poised as soon as this week to reject the House GOP’s proposal to require that in-person voters’ signatures be verified before they are given a ballot, by mandating that signatures in Michigan’s voter file be added to electronic poll books.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: One of the state’s oddest, perhaps coolest and definitely most historically underappreciated fish – the gar – is about to get some love. The long, slender, toothy and prehistoric-looking fish will, for the first time ever in Minnesota, be protected in ways similar to other gamefish, the result of a bit of an outcry on social media following a series of mass killings that some saw as wantonly wasteful. In a Legislature divided starkly along partisan lines, Minnesota’s gar species found bipartisan support. Officials say they aren’t sure exactly what restrictions they’ll place on catching and killing gar, but the move carries a growing awareness of changing attitudes toward native fish that humbly live on the opposite end of the piscatorial spectrum from celebrated fish like walleye and bass, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. The much larger environment and natural resources bill approved by both the House and Senate contains one brief reference to gar: “The commissioner must annually establish daily and possession limits for gar.” Most states, including Minnesota, consider any gar, which are native to North America, as a “rough fish” with no limits for how many can be killed, of any size, any time of year. Two species of gars are native to Minnesota, the longnose gar and shortnose gar.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which examines all fatal shootings by police officers across the state, has typically denied requests to release video footage and other evidence. But the commissioner of public safety told the Sun Herald the agency is changing its approach to allow for greater transparency. Sean Tindell, a former state senator and a former judge who became commissioner in June 2020, said he has directed the Department of Public Safety, which includes MBI, to be more responsive to public records requests. In June, the agency released video footage and some investigative material from its investigation of a Harrison County deputy’s shooting of Reginald Johnson outside the Biloxi courthouse in January. “As more and more of these incidents of officer-involved shootings are shared with the public in other parts of the country, I believe we need to be more transparent here in Mississippi as well,” Tindell said. “I’ve always been a big believer in transparency. I believe that if you … maintain a cloak of secrecy, then it lends itself to conspiracy theories and incorrect assumptions. I believe the public should have a right to view the footage and understand exactly what happened.” Tindell said his guidance for transparency applies to all agencies under his department.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Five police officers facing criminal charges remain on the job, with four on administrative duty and one still on patrol. Community leaders who have been critical of the Kansas City Police Department say they are particularly angry that a detective charged with manslaughter, Eric DeValkenaere, remains on administrative duty and is being paid, according to the Kansas City Star. “I think it’s despicable,” said Randy Fikki, senior pastor of Unity Southeast, who led several Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. Police spokeswoman Capt. Leslie Foreman said the department’s policies give supervisors discretion to determine whether to suspend officers and whether that suspension should be paid or unpaid. That is despite a separate policy that says officers charged with a crime related to their use of a department firearm will be suspended, which would apply to DeValkenaere, who is charged in the 2019 shooting of Cameron Lamb in Lamb’s backyard following a traffic incident. Officials said that policy requiring suspension when an officer’s gun is used is under review. DeValkenaere was suspended with pay after the shooting but returned to work in January. He is the only one charged in an incident involving a gun.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A subsidiary of the company that owns the Yellowstone Club bought an 18,000-acre ranch at the foot of the Crazy Mountains east of Clyde Park and said it has no plans to develop or change the property. The Lone Mountain Land Company announced the purchase of the Crazy Mountain Ranch last week, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The company said in an announcement that it doesn’t intend to develop residential subdivisions or a commercial heliskiing operation on the property. “Lone Mountain Land Company will continue to operate the ranch’s cow-calf operation and guest ranch,” Sam Byrne, managing partner and co-founder at CrossHarbor Capital Partners, said in a release. “We look forward to working with our neighbors, the Clyde Park community, and the Forest Service to be thoughtful stewards of the land and good members of the community.” The potential of residential developments and a heliskiing operation had caused a measure of public concern ahead of the sale, said Erica Lighthiser, deputy director with the Park County Environmental Council and member of the Crazy Mountain Access Project. That portion of Park County isn’t zoned, Lighthiser said, leaving any future developments to the sole discretion of the new owners.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Storms that knocked down trees and power lines across eastern Nebraska over the weekend left more people without electricity than any area storm in years. The Omaha Public Power District said with 188,000 customers losing power after the storms Friday night and early Saturday, it was a larger outage than any storm since June 2008, when 156,000 customers lost electricity. By midday Sunday, fewer than 60,000 OPPD customers remained without power, but utility officials said it could take several days to restore electricity to everyone, according to the Omaha World-Herald. By comparison, the historic snowstorm that pummeled Omaha in October 1997 left 150,000 in the dark. More recently, a Father’s Day tornado in 2017 left about 75,000 customers without power. The utility set another record after this weekend’s storm. Spokeswoman Laura King-Homan said OPPD deployed more workers in the field than ever before when 539 crew members were out Saturday working to restore power.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Driver’s licenses and identification cards are getting a new look and upgraded security features, the state Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday. DMV spokesman Kevin Malone said the agency began rolling out cards at a busy Las Vegas office, and the Reno office is due to begin offering the cards Wednesday. By next month, all 18 DMV offices around the state should have upgraded camera equipment to produce the new cards. They represent the first redesign since 2008, although some modifications were made in 2014. DMV Director Julie Butler said in a statement the new licenses and ID cards have enhanced security features that help protect Nevadans against identity theft and aid law enforcement agencies. Malone said the state currently has more than 2.2 million licensed drivers. The officials said existing licenses and ID cards will remain valid until they expire. Customers will receive the new design at renewal or during other transactions such as a name or address change. Card production fees will remain $3.25, Malone said. Nevada’s “Battle Born” insignia is featured on the front of the license in addition to the year of statehood, 1864.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: An island garden that once inspired one of America’s foremost impressionist painters has been reconstructed on the mainland for a second summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the late 1880s, poet Celia Thaxter attracted members of Boston’s literary and artistic societies to her family’s hotel on Appledore Island off the coast of Portsmouth. Artist Childe Hassam kept a studio there and featured Thaxter’s gardens in a series of paintings. The island is now home to the Shoals Marine Laboratory, and hundreds of people visit a recreation of the garden each summer. But the tours have been canceled again this year because of the pandemic. Instead, the garden has been recreated at Prescott Park in Portsmouth. Free guided tours are scheduled for July 16 and 30 and Aug. 6.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state on Monday unveiled a phone app that lets people keep track of their COVID-19 vaccination card digitally. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced the app called Docket during a news conference in Trenton. He said it’s not meant to serve as a passport and instead will serve as a backup in case people lose their paper vaccination cards. It’s unclear what the app cost the state to develop, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. She said officials plan to begin allowing people to use the app to track other vaccinations they have, but for now it works just for COVID-19 vaccines. The app is available through Apple and Google Play app stores, the governor said. “To be absolutely clear, this is not a ‘passport,’ ” Murphy said. “Docket is intended solely to give residents easy access to their COVID vaccination record, especially if their vaccination card has been damaged or lost.” Murphy has been reluctant to embrace the idea of vaccine passport, proof of vaccination, in order to enter certain places or take part in certain activities. On Monday, he said he wants to see more vaccine “equity,” particular among African American residents. Objections to passports revolve in part around privacy and security, including how people’s personal information will be stored, and fairness.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The University of New Mexico will continue to encourage that students, faculty and staff get vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus in August for the fall semester but no longer plans to require it. University President Garnett Stokes said in a campuswide email that vaccinations are key to stopping the spread of the coronavirus and that the university is working toward a 100% vaccination rate. However, the vaccine remains under emergency use authorization by the federal government, the university noted in a statement Thursday. The school previously proposed a vaccine requirement and posted a draft policy on its website. “After more than a year of mostly remote learning and working, mask mandates and testing,” the university community views its approaching full return to campus “with a sense of optimism and renewed purpose,” the statement issued Thursday said. UNM officials still urge those who are not vaccinated to continue to wear a mask, the statement said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A sinkhole on a Manhattan street collapsed under two parked cars Sunday, prompting renewed criticism of the city’s infrastructure several days after heavy rains caused severe subway flooding. There were no injuries reported after the sinkhole on the Upper West Side left an SUV with its back end stuck and the car behind it tilting forward. “But this yet another reminder: NYC simply must invest more in upgrading our outdated infrastructure,” New York City Council member Mark Levine said on Twitter. Levine posted pictures of the vehicles on Riverside Drive days after widely circulated videos showed water pouring into subway stations following heavy rain Thursday. The vehicles had been removed by Sunday afternoon.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man who served 26 years in prison for a murder he said he didn’t commit is still seeking a pardon and compensation. Dontae Sharpe told The Raleigh News & Observer on Friday that he wants to be able to support a family that includes his daughter and two grandchildren. He said he also wants to help out his mother after she spent her savings sending him money in prison and trying to prove his innocence. “The monetary part, that was the most difficult part of being released,” Sharpe said. Sharpe was 19 when he was sent to prison for the 1994 murder of 33-year-old George Radcliffe. He maintained his innocence throughout, and the NAACP argued for his release for years. He was released from a Pitt County courtroom in 2019 when a judge ordered a new trial at the end of a hearing. The prosecutor then said she wouldn’t pursue a retrial. Theresa Newman, a lawyer who represented Sharpe and a professor emerita at the Duke University Law School, said that a person who receives a pardon can apply to the state for monetary compensation. It has a cap of $750,000.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A petition backs the idea of a ban on undocumented immigrants and refugees and the notion of declaring Ward County a Second Amendment “gun sanctuary.” Language on the resolution led by county resident Nicole Engberg offers support “to ban sanctuary cities, illegal immigrants, aliens, refugees in Ward County, North Dakota, and add Ward County, North Dakota, as a Second Amendment gun sanctuary county.” Egeberg said the immigration issue on the southern border is relevant to the county. Undocumented immigrants stress the local law enforcement system, schools and tax dollars, she said at a county commission meeting. “They have no respect for our laws, no respect for our border, and it causes pressure. We have drug trafficking, human trafficking, sex trafficking, amongst many other things,” Engberg said. “We want them removed. We don’t want them brought here illegally. If they want to come here legally, appropriately vetted, they are more than welcome here in the county.” Enberg said about 5,000 people had signed the petition, the Minot Daily News reports. The commission did not object to banning illegal immigration and supporting gun rights, which members pointed out are current law. But commissioners sought more specific resolution language than was included in petitions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Wind and solar companies hoping to do business in the state will face an additional hurdle, thanks to a bill Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Monday. Under Senate Bill 52, county commissioners could reject particular wind turbines or solar farms, ban the projects entirely, or carve out portions of the county where those facilities couldn’t be built. The change, which takes effect in 90 days, adds a step for solar and wind companies that their coal and natural gas competitors don’t face. But lawmakers who introduced the bill say companies need to involve local residents – not just a little-known Ohio Power Siting Board – to succeed. Under the new law, project developers must notify county commissioners and trustees at least 90 days before filing with the power siting board. The proposal also adds a commissioner and trustee to the board while it reviews the local project. Opponents of the bill say it singles out renewable energy for unnecessary restrictions. Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers enacted a law to prevent municipalities from banning natural gas in new construction projects and saved subsidies for the owner of two coal plants. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and local development arms opposed the changes because they want to encourage renewable energy projects in the state, which can attract other business activity.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Public school teachers could have their teaching licenses suspended for teaching certain concepts about race and racism under new rules approved Monday by the State Board of Education. With just one opposing vote, the board approved emergency rules to comply with a bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that purports to ban so-called critical race theory. The new law prohibits public school teachers of grades K-12 from teaching eight different concepts about race, including that an individual, by virtue of race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously. It also prohibits teaching that any individual should feel discomfort or guilt on account of their race or sex. The Republican authors of the bill said it targeted critical race theory, which is a way of thinking about America’s history through the lens of racism, although there is no mention in the bill of critical race theory, which is not typically taught in K-12 schools. Democrats in the Legislature who opposed the bill argued it was a waste of time and addressed a nonexistent problem. Carlisha Bradley, the only Black member of the board, voted against adopting the rules, saying she believes the new law and the rules are doing a disservice to students and teachers.\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Sheriff’s deputies in southern Oregon may start arresting people who refuse to heed evacuation orders issued because of a large, growing wildfire that threatens two small towns. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the wildfire grew to about 231 square miles by Sunday afternoon. The blaze, burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest and on private land north of Sprague River and Beatty, about 290 miles southeast of Portland, was 0% contained. Fire managers on Sunday extended a Level 3 evacuation zone to unincorporated Beatty, with a population of about 120 people. Level 3 evacuations mean residents must leave immediately. Deputies continued to circle the area to ensure people were contacted, said Stacey Todd, a spokesperson for Klamath County Emergency Management. She couldn’t recall a time the sheriff’s office warned of citations or arrests for failing to evacuate during a wildfire.“I think the message has gotten out that this is a very serious fire that is unpredictable and is very high-risk to the area,” Todd said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s Department of Health has reduced the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered by about 500,000, saying the numbers were duplicates. The figures, released Friday evening without explanation, also showed an increase of about 60,000 in the number of people counted as fully vaccinated. The numbers include 66 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. They do not include Philadelphia, which is its own vaccine jurisdiction. For all 67 counties, the percentage of people 18 and over who are vaccinated was 61%, up slightly with the change in data. Asked about the changed figures, a Department of Health spokesperson said agency staff had been working to link both first and second doses to individual residents. As a result, they were removing duplicated data that resulted from providers using software that did not include a unique patient identifier or uploading duplicate data, or from people getting first and second doses from different providers. The data now more accurately reflects the number of people who have received the first of a two-dose vaccine, the spokesperson said. Friday’s data showed just under 11.3 million total vaccine doses, down from Thursday’s figure of 11.8 million. It also showed over 5.5 million people fully vaccinated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has officially banned the release of large numbers of balloons in a move to protect wildlife. Under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Dan McKee, the state will prohibit anyone from intentionally releasing 10 or more helium or other lighter-than-air balloons outdoors. Supporters say balloon releases are an environmental nuisance and pose a serious threat to birds, marine animals and other wildlife that ingest or become entangled in balloon litter. Violators face a fine of $100 when the new rule takes effect in November. The new law won’t affect hot air balloons, indoor balloon releases, or scientific and weather research.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is asking for public input on whether state-leased Wildlife Management Areas should be open for hunting on Sundays. The Department of Natural Resources has an online survey up until July 28 as well as four public hearings planned across the state over the next two weeks. The 1.2 million acres public land in South Carolina are also used for fishing, hiking, bird-watching and other ways to observe nature. Hunters can use the public land during season, but state law only allows hunting on Sundays on private land. The first of four public hearings on the hunting changes is set for Tuesday at the Clemson Pee Dee Research and Education Center in Florence. There is a meeting Thursday at the Clinton National Guard Armory, on July 19 at the Santee Cooper Auditorium in Moncks Corner, and July 26 at a site that hasn’t been determined in Columbia. All the meetings start at 6 p.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: As federal officials debate investing billions of dollars in broadband access, the state is planning to invest $100million as it struggles to extend reliable internet service to every corner of the state. Data suggests many South Dakota schoolchildren and adults who worked from home during the pandemic struggled with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state’s poorest and least populated counties. Advocates say the “digital divide” across South Dakota and the rest of the U.S. is due largely to two factors: a lack of internet infrastructure in rural areas and relatively high costs that have made broadband unaffordable for many in urban centers. In about half of South Dakota’s counties – 34 of 66 – measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 88% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft – 33 of 65 counties – no more than 28% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. That helps explain why the Legislature and Gov. Kristi Noem earlier this year set aside $100 million, mostly federal pandemic relief money, to help the telecommunications industry build fiber lines and antenna towers in rural areas.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A federal judge in the state has joined other judges in blocking a Biden administration program designed to redress generations of discrimination against some farmers, saying the federal government has failed to show the U.S. Department of Agriculture discriminates against people of color today. Chief U.S. District Judge Thomas Anderson issued a national injunction that bars the Biden administration from enacting the loan forgiveness plan approved by Congress in March as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. The injunction is the third to result from litigation filed in seven states, including Tennessee, on behalf of white farmers in the past month, according to court records. The administration said it chose to funnel relief to qualifying farmers because of the USDA’s “long history” of discriminating against Black farmers and the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on minorities. White farmers, including Tennessee rancher Rob Holman, are calling it “reverse racism” in litigation filed by conservative legal advocacy groups, including the Southeastern Legal Foundation and Mountain States Legal Foundation. Anderson agreed in his ruling.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrats in the Legislature on Monday began bolting for Washington, D.C., and said they were ready to remain there for weeks in a second revolt against a GOP overhaul of election laws, forcing a dramatic new showdown over voting rights in America. One large group was set to leave Austin on private planes before the GOP could pass a voting bill in a special legislative session ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that began days ago. It was not immediately clear how many of the 67 Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives planned to go, but it was expected to be enough to bring the Legislature to a halt. “This is a now-or-never for our democracy. We are holding the line in Texas,” said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “We’ve left our jobs; we’ve left our families; we’ve left our homes. Because there is nothing more important than voting rights in America.” By leaving, Democrats would again deny the GOP majority a quorum to pass bills, barely a month after their walkout thwarted the first push for sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, including outlawing 24-hour polling places, banning ballot drop boxes and empowering partisan poll watchers.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Water managers in the bone-dry state reported last week that 98% of Utah was in extreme or exceptional levels of drought. The state was already 10 inches of precipitation below the “normal” amount expected in a given water year, making it extremely unlikely it would reach its usual count of 27 inches during an average water year, according to the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “Utah’s precipitation is down about 38% this year compared to an average year. It’s extremely unlikely we can make up that deficit between now and the end of the watering year on Sept. 30,” said Brian Stee, executive director of the Utah DNR. “When we consider future patterns, we should not expect an immediate recovery from this extreme drought. We anticipate it will take time, possibly years, to climb out.” In southwestern Utah, water managers had only measured 41% of the precipitation normally expected by this point in the water year. Drought maps produced by the U.S. Drought Monitor showed small pockets of northern Utah were the only places in the state not already at the two worst levels of drought as measured by federal climate criteria, with the entire southwestern section of the state rated as being in “exceptional” drought, the worst category.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: About 40 homeless people who had been scheduled to lose their pandemic-related emergency hotel rooms in the state on July 1 are seeking to be verified as having a disability, allowing them to stay longer. Late last month, a federal court judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for two weeks for some people to show they can remain eligible. That came after Vermont Legal Aid sued the state, alleging the changes violate state law and have a restrictive definition of what qualifies as a disability. About 700 people were expected to lose their hotel rooms at the beginning of the month. The state has extended the hotel voucher program 84 days for families with children, the disabled, pregnant women and other vulnerable people, and it gave $2,500 checks to those no longer eligible. Families with children and some disabled households may be able to stay longer. So far, 37 people who were no longer eligible July 1 have attested that they have a disability while they work to get paperwork from a medical provider, Nicole Tousignant of the Vermont Department for Children and Families said Monday. Vermont spent $79 million on the hotel vouchers program, housing up to 2,000 households on some nights, but the program is not financially sustainable, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: A conservative group is asking a court to temporarily prohibit Virginia Tech from enforcing some of its policies against harassment and discrimination. The Roanoke Times reports the group, called Speech First Inc., has already filed a lawsuit on behalf of three students against the school’s anti-bias policies. Now the group wants a federal judge to temporarily prevent the university from enforcing the policies until he rules on the lawsuit. The group contends that the students hold views that are unpopular on a campus of roughly 35,000 students. Those views include opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement as well as same-sex marriage and abortion. The lawsuit claims Virginia Tech’s policies are overly vague because they forbid “telling unwelcome jokes about someone’s identity” and urging “religious beliefs on someone who finds it unwelcome.” The school has revised one of its policies by clarifying that a ban on speech for “partisan and political purposes” applies only to employees. But Virginia Tech is defending the rest and urged the judge not to grant the group’s request for a preliminary injunction. “It cannot be that Virginia Tech is essentially prohibited in the face of the First Amendment” from having anti-harassment policies, said counsel to the Attorney General Jessica Samuels, who represents university President Tim Sands.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: One day after an investigation found that two of six Seattle police officers violated the law while in Washington, D.C., during the Jan. 6 insurrection, lawyers representing the officers in a related public records case filed a motion to withdraw from that case. The six officers had filed a lawsuit in February against a list of people who had filed public records requests seeking the officers’ identities and information about the investigation by the Office of Police Accountability into their activities while in the nation’s capital. After a judge ordered the release of their identities in March, the officers appealed. Sam Sueoka, a Seattle University law student who was named in the officers’ lawsuit, has asked the Washington Supreme Court to decide the issue. The court will consider that request at the end of July. On Thursday, the OPA released a report on its investigation. It found that at least two of the officers had violated the law and department policy by trespassing at the U.S. Capitol while rioters stormed the building. OPA Director Andrew Myerberg recommended that the two officers be fired. On Friday, the officers’ three lawyers, Kelly Sheridan, Victoria Ainsworth and Kayla Higgins, filed a motion stating their intent to leave the public records case. They did not give a reason but said withdrawal would be effective July 19.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: Federal regulators have joined state officials in reviewing lead service lines in the city for elevated levels of the toxin in drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will assist the state Department of Health and Human Resources and the Clarksburg Water System in the review, which was announced July 2, the DHHR said in a news release. Sampling in several homes showed lead levels above a limit set by the EPA. Lead lines were phased out in the 1950s, and it’s unlikely homes built after 1960 would have them. The DHHR is encouraging residents of homes built before 1950 to use bottled water for consumption and have children younger than age 6 evaluated for lead, Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said in the statement. The issue of lead service lines was first identified by Bureau for Public Health staff during assessments conducted in the homes of children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Devil’s Lake State Park, Wisconsin’s most-visited park, is set to get larger. The Wisconsin Natural Resources Board has unanimously approved purchasing a 220-acre property for $1.64 million to add onto the park, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. “It is truly a great potential addition to Devil’s Lake State Park,” Jim Lemke, real estate section chief at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, told the board. “The land is very useful. It’s beautifully wooded with mature hardwoods and has potential of many different opportunities for public use.” The parcel is located on the southwestern edge of the park and could be used for hunting and wildlife watching. It could also be developed into hiking and mountain biking trails, according to a memo on the proposed purchase. The money to purchase the land would come from the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, which the state uses to purchase new land for parks and recreation areas. Located outside Baraboo and 45 minutes north of Madison, the approximately 9,200-acre Devil’s Lake was created in 1911 and is the third-oldest state park. There were 2.1 million visitors to Devil’s Lake last year, making it Wisconsin’s most popular park.\n\nWyoming\n\nGlenrock: The community is jumping at the chance for a company to build an experimental power source on the edge of town. Before the end of the year, developers of a new type of nuclear power plant will decide which of four Wyoming towns will house their project, and Glenrock wants to be selected, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. During a Wednesday meeting with the heads of TerraPower and Rocky Mountain Power, community leaders listened attentively to the companies’ pitch. Most were already on board with the project. A few safety questions did come up, but Glenrock’s leaders wanted to focus the conversation on logistics – not risk. The town’s coal-fired power plant, Dave Johnston, is set to retire in 2027, taking 191 jobs with it. The Natrium reactor is scheduled to come online the following year, generating an estimated 250 permanent jobs. Its developers intend to establish training programs to help workers in the selected community transition from their current jobs at the coal plant to new roles at the nuclear facility. Glenrock is a town of just 2,600 people; Converse County’s entire population numbers fewer than 14,000. The community’s history is intertwined with that of the energy sector. Many see the nuclear plant not only as a natural transition but a necessary one for their economic survival.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/13"}]}

Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff attended the ceremony at the White House as well.\n\n“The Fourth of July week reminds us what brought us together long ago, and still binds us – binds us at our best, what we strive for. We the people, doing what we can to ensure that the idea of America, the cause of freedom, shines like the sun to light up the future of the world,” Biden said in his opening remarks. “That’s the soul of our nation. That’s who we are as Americans.”\n\nThe medal is “presented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said.\n\nThe President awarded the medal posthumously to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, former Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington had been scheduled to attend the event to receive his medal but the White House said he had tested positive for Covid-19 ahead of the ceremony. Biden noted the actor’s absence and said he “couldn’t be here today but wanted to be” and said he’d give him the medal at a different time.\n\nRapinoe, a member of the US women’s national soccer team who is an Olympic gold medalist and two-time Women’s World Cup champion, is the first female soccer player to receive the medal. Biden also noted Biles, 25, is the youngest person to ever receive the award.\n\nThe list of recipients included Fred Gray, who was one of the first Black members of the Alabama state legislature since Reconstruction and who represented Rosa Parks, the NAACP, and Martin Luther King as an attorney. It also included one of the most decorated women in the history of the US military, retired Brigadier General Wilma Vaught; a critical care nurse who was the first American to receive a Covid-19 vaccine outside of clinical trials, Sandra Lindsay; and the first Hispanic woman to serve as a college president, Dr. Julieta García.\n\nLindsay told CNN’s Boris Sanchez on Thursday that she wanted to use her platform to encourage people to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nHer message to those still skeptical about getting the vaccine, she said, is “continue to do your research. Reach out to people you trust. I am still here, it’s been almost three years and I continue to advocate. So if you are not protected yet, please go out and get yourself protected.”\n\nOther recipients included: Catholic social justice leader Sister Simone Campbell, the former executive director of NETWORK who leads the “Nuns on the Bus,” a group of politically active nuns; civil rights activist Diane Nash, who worked with Martin Luther King and is a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; Father Alexander Karloutsos, the former vicar general of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America; civil rights advocate Raúl Yzaguirre, who served as CEO and president of National Council of La Raza and former Republican Sen.

NBC News' Peter Alexander reported on Twitter that the ceremony took place minutes after the House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on charges of \"inciting violence against the government of the United States\" in the wake of last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nNo official advanced announcement was made about the presentation from the White House, the National Endowment for the Arts or representatives for the music stars. Keith's publicist declined to comment, and Skaggs' could not be reached for comment prior to publication.\n\nThe National Medal of Arts is considered the highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the U.S. government. It is awarded by the president to individuals or groups who are \"deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and availability of the arts in the United States.\"\n\nAn award-winning country hitmaker based in Norman, Keith headlined Trump's 2017 inauguration festivities, a controversial gig he made no apologies for taking.\n\n“I played the (Nobel) Peace Prize (festivities) for Obama in Oslo. I played at the White House for George W. (Bush). Anytime the commander in chief invites me to come play at a ceremony for our country, I’ll go. And I don’t care what anybody says about any of that. I’m a big boy. I can take the heat. I’m your guy,” Keith told The Oklahoman in a 2017 interview.\n\n“Hell, yes, it’s an honor. The president of the United States asks you to come do something, or you get to attend an event where the president is, you always go. It doesn’t matter which one you play for, you’re gonna get flak. And most people don’t wanna go ‘cause they don’t want the flak. And I take it as an honor.”\n\nKeith, who was born in Clinton and grew up in Moore, told The Oklahoman in a 2015 interview that he is aware of the cartoonish way his detractors view him: as a simpleminded, flag-waving right-winger who only writes drinking songs and jingoist military anthems. But he is also a successful entrepreneur who once appeared on the cover of the Forbes Celebrity 100 issue, a registered Independent whose primary political stance is staunchly supporting the troops, and a dedicated songsmith who was inducted in 2015 into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n“I’ll have real liberal people come up to me and say, ‘You’re my favorite Republican,’ and I’m thinking, ‘You didn’t do your homework, Jack.’ I’m not a political guy, I just support the troops. I come from a long line of Democrats. I’m one of the first non-Democrats in our family and I’m an Independent. … I try to pick the guy that I think’ll do the best job; I don’t care how they’re affiliated,” Keith told The Oklahoman in a 2015 interview.\n\nAn inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame, IBMA Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame, Musicians Hall of Fame and GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame, Skaggs told The Gospel Herald in a 2016 interview that he was supporting Trump because of the then-presidential candidate's pro-life and religious freedom stances.\n\n\"I love his [Trump's] enthusiasm and his fighting spirit. He's not going to let anyone bulldoze over him because he's a bulldozer himself. Mr. Trump is someone who tears down and rebuilds,\" Skaggs told The Gospel Herald in 2016. \"I believe Donald Trump is the right person in the right place, and that it's prophetic.\"\n\nWith the inauguration of President-elect Biden scheduled for Jan. 20, Trump has made some last-minute awards presentations. He honored golfers Annika Sorenstam, Gary Player and the late Babe Zaharias with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a private ceremony Feb. 7, the day after Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBut New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick announced Monday that he had decided not to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Trump was slated to present to him Thursday, following last week's deadly events at the U.S. Capitol. The AP reports that Belichick said in a statement that “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”\n\n“I was flattered ... out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” the coach said in a statement, which was forwarded to the AP by the Patriots.\n\n“Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award. Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation’s values, freedom and democracy.

John McCain and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.\n\nThe list includes Olympic athletes Simone Biles and Megan Rapinoe, the fifth and sixth female athletes to be honored for the award. Rapinoe will be the first female soccer player to receive the medal.\n\nAccording to a statement from US Soccer, Rapinoe, the US Women’s National Team forward and an advocate for equal pay, found out last week when Biden called her between practice sessions in Denver. When she saw “The White House” pop up on her phone screen, she thought she was either getting a robocall or being pranked by her teammates.\n\n“In that moment I spoke to the President, I was, and still am, totally overwhelmed,” Rapinoe said in a statement, adding that she is thinking of “all the people who I feel deserve a part of this medal.”\n\n“I am humbled and truly honored to be chosen for this award by President Biden and feel as inspired and motivated as ever to continue this long history of fighting for the freedoms of all people.

There have been no shortage of setbacks as I relearned how to talk and how to walk, just as there have been no shortage of setbacks in the fight for gun safety that I’ve dedicated my life to. And yet I’ve never lost hope,” she said. “One of my reasons for hope sits inside the Oval Office today, elected to accomplish the near-impossible task of healing a divided nation.”\n\nOther recipients include Dr. Juliet Garcia – the first Hispanic woman to serve as a college president, Gold Star father Khizr Khan, Sandra Lindsay – a New York nurse who was the first American to receive a Covid-19 vaccine outside of clinical trials, and Brigadier General Wilma Vaught – one of the most decorated women in the history of the US military.\n\nThe honorees have a variety of connections to Democrats and Biden world.\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs, the founder of Emerson Collective and Steve Jobs’ widow, donated more than $700,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in 2020.\n\nMcCain’s widow, Cindy McCain, was appointed by Biden to serve as the US Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Biden appointed Khan to serve on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom last year.

A virtuoso of the mandolin and fiddle, Ricky Skaggs creates and produces bluegrass music that preserves the musical legacy of the most talented artists of his generation.\"\n\nAlso honored with the National Medal of Arts were Nick Ut, for his decades of contributions to wartime photojournalism; Earl “Rusty” Powell III, for his \"dedicated work preserving, procuring, and expanding the world’s greatest exhibitions\" as the longest-serving director of the National Gallery of Art; and Mary Costa, for her \"extraordinary talent, inspiration, and contribution to the operatic arts\" in her career, which has included performances in 38 operatic roles, according to the White House news release.\n\nThe National Medal of Arts is the highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the U.S. Government. Trump also awarded the National Humanities Medal - honoring individuals or groups whose work has deepened the Nation's understanding of the humanities and broadened our citizens' engagement with history, literature, languages, philosophy and other humanities subjects - to three recipients on Wednesday, according to the White House news release.\n\nThe National Humanities Medal was awarded to Kay Coles James, for her \"intellectual leadership, devotion to our Constitutional principles, and steadfast commitment to opportunity for all\"; O. James Lighthizer, for his decades of work protecting thousands of acres of Civil War battlefields for future generations; and the National World War II Museum for its \"devotion to bringing to life the story of America’s greatest generation and our remarkable victory against the forces of evil.\"\n\nThe House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on charges of \"inciting violence against the government of the United States\" in the wake of last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nNo official advanced announcement was made about Wednesday's medals presentation from the White House, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities or representatives for Keith or Skaggs. Keith's publicist declined to comment Wednesday.\n\nAn Oklahoma native who was born in Clinton and grew up in Moore, Keith has said in past interviews with The Oklahoman that being asked to attend an event by the president of the United States is an honor and \"you always go.\" The country hitmaker headlined Trump's 2017 inauguration festivities, a controversial gig he made no apologies for taking.\n\n“I played the (Nobel) Peace Prize (festivities) for Obama in Oslo. I played at the White House for George W. (Bush). Anytime the commander in chief invites me to come play at a ceremony for our country, I’ll go. And I don’t care what anybody says about any of that. I’m a big boy. I can take the heat. I’m your guy,” Keith told The Oklahoman in a 2017 interview.\n\n“Hell, yes, it’s an honor. The president of the United States asks you to come do something, or you get to attend an event where the president is, you always go. It doesn’t matter which one you play for, you’re gonna get flak. And most people don’t wanna go ‘cause they don’t want the flak. And I take it as an honor.”\n\nKeith told The Oklahoman in a 2015 interview that he is aware of the cartoonish way his detractors view him: as a simpleminded, flag-waving right-winger who only writes drinking songs and jingoist military anthems. But he is also a successful entrepreneur who once appeared on the cover of the Forbes Celebrity 100 issue, a dedicated songsmith who was inducted in 2015 into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and a registered Independent whose primary political stance is staunchly supporting the troops.\n\n“I’ll have real liberal people come up to me and say, ‘You’re my favorite Republican,’ and I’m thinking, ‘You didn’t do your homework, Jack.’ I’m not a political guy, I just support the troops. I come from a long line of Democrats. I’m one of the first non-Democrats in our family and I’m an Independent. … I try to pick the guy that I think’ll do the best job; I don’t care how they’re affiliated,” Keith told The Oklahoman in a 2015 interview.\n\nWith the inauguration of President-elect Biden scheduled for Jan. 20, Trump has made several last-minute awards presentations over the past week. He honored golfers Annika Sorenstam, Gary Player and the late Babe Zaharias with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a private ceremony Feb. 7, the day after Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBut New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick announced Monday that he had decided not to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Trump was slated to present to him today, following last week's deadly events at the U.S. Capitol. The AP reports that Belichick said in a statement that “remaining true to the people, team and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”\n\n“I was flattered ... out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” the coach said in a statement, which was forwarded to The Associated Press by the Patriots.\n\n“Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award. Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation’s values, freedom and democracy. I know I also represent my family and the New England Patriots team.”\n\nFeatures Writer Brandy \"BAM\" McDonnell covers Oklahoma's arts, entertainment and cultural sectors for The Oklahoman and Oklahoman.com.

Not this week. Not this month. Not from this president who just a few days ago fired up an angry mob that attacked the Capitol in an act of domestic terrorism like we’ve never seen before.\n\nThis has nothing to do with politics but rather doing what’s right for our country. President Trump is trying to go about business as usual just days after that attack on the Capitol and it would be wrong for anyone with a spine or any love for our country to play along with that man as his final days in the Oval Office slowly tick away.\n\nBusiness shouldn’t go on as usual in the White House until at least Jan. 20 when president-elect Joe Biden takes over, or possibly earlier depending if any impeachment hearings actually move forward.\n\nThe day after last week’s attack we saw Trump give out two Medal of Freedom awards to golfers Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player.

And when I say a military family, the man basically grew up at the Naval Academy and completely immersed himself into the workings of the Navy and how important our military is to our nation.\n\nBelichick also has to understand how badly this would look to the members of his team, who he has stood up for many times over the years, but especially over the past year. Just a few weeks ago he spoke about the importance of the social justice meetings and work his team has done over the past six months.\n\nYou can’t say that and then a few weeks later let Trump put a medal around your neck.\n\nCan’t happen.\n\nBelichick also should look at how the PGA of America voted Sunday night to move the 2022 PGA Championship from one of Trump’s golf courses.\n\nMany people and organizations are rightly stepping back from the president in the days after the attack on the Capitol. This isn’t the time to be going toward him, unless that’s how you want to be remembered.\n\nAccepting this honor from the president would immediately demolish any credibility Belichick has built with his players and would tarnish his image unlike anything he’s ever done while in charge of the Patriots’ organization.\n\nAnd for those reasons he must say no thank you to Trump.

New York hip-hop pioneer MC Lyte will be the event's host.\n\nAccording to organizers, the Freedom Award is the \"signature event,\" of the 33-year-old museum, which was constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where King was assassinated in 1968, to honor King's legacy and to continue his work.\n\nLee, 67 — arguably as famous for his often comedic acting roles and appearances in television commercials and for his New York sports fandom as for his movies — is America's preeminent Black writer-director and one of the world's most recognizable filmmakers. By placing American racial history and themes into a dramatic context, and by celebrating Black achievement within an often antagonistic cultural milieu, his movies complement the goal of the National Civil Rights Museum, which, according to its mission statement, tells \"the story of the ongoing struggle for human rights\" and works to \"educate and serve as a catalyst to inspire action to create positive social change.\"\n\nSome of Lee's significant films include \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989), in which racial tensions in Brooklyn erupt in violence; \"Malcolm X\" (1992), an epic biopic with Denzel Washington as the doomed activist; \"Bamboozled\" (2000), about racism in entertainment; \"Miracle at St. Anna\" (2008), about Black soldiers in World War II; and \"BlacKkKlansman\" (2018), which earned Lee an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Meanwhile, Lee's documentaries, which even more directly critique America's distressing racial legacy, include \"4 Little Girls,\" about the murderous 1963 Alabama church bombing, and \"When the Levees Broke,\" about the racist policies that exacerbated the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster.\n\nLee is no stranger to Memphis. In 2010 and 2016, he gave talks at the University of Memphis. And in 2023, he attended the funeral at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church for Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers. \"I understand people saying, 'I can't take all this Black trauma,'\" Lee said, describing some responses to the video footage of Nichols' brutal beating. \"But me, personally, I have to look at what's being done to us.\"\n\nRussell T. Wigginton, museum president, cited Lee's \"iconic storytelling.\"\n\n“So much about understanding African-American culture, for a general audience, comes through the lens — the literal lens — that Spike Lee created,” he said.\n\nHe added that Lee, as a mentor to young artists and a professor at the New York University School of the Arts, also was “a dedicated educator committed to nurturing the next generation of filmmakers.”\n\nThe other 2024 Freedom Award recipients share Lee's commitment to social justice if not his household-name status.\n\nBorn in Muskogee, Oklahoma, Clayton is \"a trailblazing leader in civil rights and broadcasting,\" said Wigginton.\n\nAn activist for more than six decades, Clayton worked with the National Urban League in Chicago and then with King in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta, where she developed a deep friendship with King's wife, Coretta Scott King.\n\nIn 1967, she became host of \"The Xernona Clayton Show\" on WAGA-TV in Atlanta, making her one of the first Black people to host a prime-time talk show. She later joined Turner Broadcasting, where she became corporate vice president for urban affairs.\n\n2023 FREEDOM AWARD: Stacey Abrams, Kerry Kennedy and Clayborne Carson honored\n\nThe Baltimore-born Ifill, meanwhile, is a lawyer, a historian of lynching and voting discrimination, and former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, where she litigated what Wigginton called \"cutting-edge and urgent civil rights issues\" involving voter suppression, health-care inequity and other issues.\n\nIn 2021, Time magazine named Ifill one of the 100 most influential people in the world for her defense of voting rights. That same year, she was appointed to an endowed chair in civil rights at Howard University.\n\nBilled by the museum as \"one of the nation's most prestigious events,\" the Freedom Award — now in its 33rd year — has been given to close to 100 honorees. Some past recipients include Coretta Scott King, Jimmy Carter, Lech Walesa, Sidney Poitier, Stevie Wonder, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and at least three people so famous — Bono, Oprah and Usher — they don't need last names.\n\nIn 2018, Joe Biden was a recipient, while Michelle Obama was among the 2021 honorees.\n\nAs a museum press release states, the Freedom Award \"pays tribute to individuals who have shown unwavering commitment to promoting justice and equality.\"\n\nWigginton called the award recipients \"champions of freedom\" who even today are \"creating blueprints\" for a just society.\n\nThe Freedom Award, he said, is intended to honor not only civil rights advocates of the past but to spotlight heroes of the present. In recognizing human rights pioneers, \"We don’t want to romanticize them or their work such that people today don’t feel that they can make as important a difference,” he said. “It’s important that we empower people today. We’re still fighting some of the same fights in our society.”\n\nThe Oct. 17 Freedom Award ceremony is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m., with the gala and \"red carpet\" set for 5:30.

Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

That’s Kamala. And we all know what happened. The banks caved.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ sister, Maya Harris, pays tribute to their mother\n\nMaya Harris, Kamala Harris’ younger sister, opened her remarks by reflecting on her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.\n\n“Mommy was so many things to so many people, a civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her two little girls,” said Maya Harris. “But most of all, Mommy was a trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself. And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote. Do not report rumors. FOCUS.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report that according to a representative for the singer, \"Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there.”\n\nLeading up to the DNC, fans speculated the megastar might perform. Of course, Walz has been deemed a certified Beyhive member. And Beyoncé's camp gave Harris approval to use her song \"Freedom\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on her campaign trail. The song has become an anthem for Harris' campaign.\n\n− Liz Schubauer\n\nAnother Republican for Harris addresses Democratic audience\n\nSaying he was “proud to be in the trenches” with the evening’s crowd, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021. He was one of two Republicans to serve on the House committee investigating the insurrection at the Capitol. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” Kinzinger asked.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nEva Longoria calls on Democrats to say ‘she se puede’\n\nActress Eva Longoria put a new twist on a popular chant as she urged the crowd to root for Harris’ success.

It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store?

These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\n“John McCain was an American hero,” Gallego said. “Show some respect.”\n\n“Trump’s Project 2025 would slash veteran benefits and force VA hospitals to close across the nation,” he said. “Show some respect.”\n\n--Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMark Kelly says Trump ‘dreaming’ of becoming a dictator\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said Harris will stand with America’s allies and is “the leader we need right now.” Harris, he said, understands the importance of international alliances like NATO, and of supporting Ukraine in its war defending itself from Russia’s invasion.\n\n“Donald Trump skipped his intelligence briefings,” Kelly said. “He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself.”\n\nKelly referred to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that said Trump described fallen service members were “suckers” and “losers.” Trump denies the report.\n\n“Trump thinks that Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are suckers and losers,” Kelly said. “If we fall for that again and make him the commander in chief, the only suckers would be us.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miler\n\nDenied a speaker, pro-Palestinian Democratic delegates make new demand on Kamala Harris\n\nStymied in their demand that a Palestinian-American be allowed to speak to the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, a group of uncommitted delegates ended a protest outside the United Center on Thursday with a new demand: that Vice President Kamala Harris meet Arab-American and Muslims in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThey also set a deadline for such a meeting or meetings to take place of Sept. 15.\n\nWhile not saying what they would or would not do if a meeting did not take place to discuss their insistence that the U.S. stop shipping weapons to Israel and demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the organizers suggested there would be ramifications. Those could potentially involve holding back in terms of organizing on Harris' behalf in the fall campaign or arguing her case to voters.\n\n−Todd Spangler, Karissa Waddick and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nGroup shares harrowing stories about gun violence\n\nA group took to the stage at the convention Thursday night to retell somber stories about the loss of their loved ones from gun violence.

Twenty-six people were killed at the school in a mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nKim Rubio recalled when her daughter Lexi walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, for the last time.\n\n“It’s 10:30am at Robb Elementary in Uvalde,” Rubio said. “The school is recognizing my 10 year old daughter, Lexi, for receiving all A's. She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved. I'll keep calling and I'll keep fighting,” McFadden said. Edgar Vilchez, whose friend was killed in a shooting at their high school, said that moment changed him. “Instead about worrying about taking a test, I started worrying about living to take another test,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nShooting survivor and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords takes the stage\n\nPart of a series of speakers to address gun violence, mass shooting survivor and former Rep.

Now she's guiding my own children, and I know she'll guide our country forward,” said Meena Harris.\n\nElla Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, said that the vice president came into her life when she was 14 - “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked.\n\n“Like a lot of young people, I didn't always understand what I was feeling. But no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring, and always took me seriously. She's never stopped listening to me, and she's not going to stop listening to all of us,” Emhoff said.\n\nHelena Hudlin, goddaughter of Harris, said that Kamala Harris’ advice “means everything, whether it's pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn't feel so hopeful.”\n\n“She taught me that making a difference means giving your whole heart and taking action,” Hudlin said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKerry Washington brings 'Scandal' costar Tony Goldwyn, Harris family members on stage with her\n\nActress Kerry Washington helped host the final hours of the Democratic convention’s final night.\n\nShe brought back to the stage her former “Scandal” costar Tony Goldwyn, who days earlier also made a convention stage appearance.

And between now and Election Day each of us must defend the dream too, by electing them as vice president and president of the United States of America.”\n\n− Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nTeacher union presidents blast Trump, Vance\n\nBecky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, called former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance “not just wrong.”\n\n“They’re dangerous,” she said.\n\nPringle criticized Project 2025, a conservative guidebook for a Republican presidency that calls for eliminating the Department of Education. Trump has repeatedly denied association with the document.\n\nPresident of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten followed Pringle on stage and continued criticism of the Republican ticket.\n\n“Donald Trump and JD Vance can’t claim they’re pro-child while gutting funding for public schools,” Weingarten said.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVeronica Escobar kicks off welcome remarks at final night of convention\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, opened up her remarks knocking Trump for being a “small man speaking in small venues talking about small ideas.”\n\n“Our ideas, our vision for America, brings us together,” said Escobar.\n\n“Our vision for America embraces every community and everyone. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are working hard because they know our country is great. They know that we can build a future for all of us, and they're earning our votes by laying out a plan that puts the American dream not just within reach, but so we can fully grasp,” she added.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTennessee Three not expected to speak at DNC amid rumors of a mystery guest\n\nThe trio of Tennessee lawmakers known as the \"Tennessee Three\" were expected to get a primetime speaking slot at Thursday's Democratic National Convention, but the group is expected to be bumped from the program amid last-minute scheduling changes.\n\nState Reps. Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson will not be speaking from the DNC stage tonight, according to a Tennessee House Democratic caucus spokesperson.\n\nThe scheduling shift comes amid swirling rumors that a surprise speaker was being slotted into Thursday's night schedule. None of the rumors have been confirmed, though social media is abuzz that a high-profile celebrity such as Beyoncé or Taylor Swift may appear.\n\n− Melissa Brown\n\nWho are Ella and Cole Emhoff? Meet Kamala Harris' stepchildren − who call the VP 'Momala.'\n\nAs America’s first second gentleman, Doug Emhoff became the first person to bear the title when Vice President Kamala Harris was sworn into office in 2021.\n\nBut how did the two meet? Originally from Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Emhoff became an attorney in Los Angeles, focusing on entertainment and intellectual property law. In 2013, one of Emhoff’s clients – who also happened to be Harris’ best friend – set the pair up on a date.\n\nHarris and Emhoff were married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California where Harris’ sister, Maya, officiated. It was Harris’ first marriage and Emhoff’s second, and they share two adult children from his former marriage, Ella and Cole.\n\n− Victor Hagan\n\nGus Walz broke the internet with his tearful love for his dad. Then the bullying began\n\nAn emotional, unscripted moment between Tim Walz and his 17-year-old son, Gus, has unleased a flood of praise and admiration – but it also has prompted ugly online bullying.\n\nGus Walz, who has a nonverbal learning disorder as well as anxiety and ADHD, watched excitedly from the front row of Chicago’s United Center and sobbed openly Wednesday night as his father, the Democratic nominee for vice president, delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe Minnesota governor was recounting the difficult fertility treatment he and his wife, Gwen, went through to conceive their daughter, Hope.\n\nBut the show of affection triggered a swath of snark and ugly comments from internet trolls, many of them MAGA supporters of former President Donald Trump, who faces Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Walz in November.\n\n– Michael Collins and Sam Woodward\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nThere's a good chance you'd recognize Nadine Seiler. The 59-year-old woman has developed a knack for being at the right place at the right time to get photographed by the media as she protests former President Donald Trump and conservative policies like the Agenda 2025 plan to remake the federal government.\n\nMultiple news photographers have captured Seiler's protests across the country since at least 2019, from Chicago to Milwaukee to Miami to outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nThis isn't how she'd planned to spend her retirement savings after arriving in the United States from the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago nearly 40 years ago. But with her bright makeup and eye-catching signs, protest has become her calling. In Chicago, she's sleeping in a friend's van so she can keep costs down.\n\n\"I am crazy,\" Seiler said with a laugh. \"Nobody who is totally sane would do this.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nHarris celebrates nomination + 10-year wedding anniversary\n\nKamala Harris will take the stage tonight to formally accept her party’s presidential nomination. She also has another cause for celebration Thursday: her and her husband, Doug Emhoff’s 10th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe pair married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California. In his convention address Tuesday, Emhoff recalled an awkward voicemail he left for Harris when they first met and said she now plays the saved recording back for him each anniversary.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump travels to border\n\nAfter traveling to the Arizona-Mexico border to protest illegal crossings, Donald Trump began his speech Thursday with false comments about a \"coup\" against president and former election opponent Joe Biden.\n\n\"A very sad time for this country in many ways,\" Trump said. \"You had a candidate - I was no fan of Joe Biden - but the way he was taken out was a coup.\"\n\nTrump has protested having to run against Kamala Harris throughout his counter-convention tour this week, noting that she never received a primary vote. There was no coup, however; the party turned to Vice President Harris after Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\nTo be sure, Trump did use most of his remarks Thursday to criticize the Bush-Harris administration's record on border security. The event that lasted more than an hour also featured family members who have lost loved ones in crimes committed by people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn criticizing Harris, Trump said Harris \"will not mention the victims\" in her acceptance speech on Thursday night. During the convention, Democratic speakers said Trump is also responsible for border problems, having used his power over Republican lawmakers to block legislation that would have tightened the border.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhite House slams ‘anti-Semitic’ Donald Trump post targeting Josh Shapiro\n\nThe White House condemned a social media post from Donald Trump as “Antisemitic, dangerous and hurtful” after the former president referred to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and slammed his support for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social Wednesday night after Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, wrote that Shapiro “made a really bad and poorly delivered speech” for Harris – someone who Trump said “hates Israel and will do nothing” to help Israel survive.\n\n“Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,” Trump wrote. “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.”\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, was among the final contenders for Harris’ vice-presidential running-mate before Harris ultimately picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. White House spokesman Herbie Ziskend, in a statement, called it “Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’”\n\nZiskend added: “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kinds.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters take the spotlight during DNC. What impact will they make?\n\nIt's been no 1968.\n\nThe prospect that massive protests over the war in Gaza would dominate the Democratic National Convention and bring mayhem to the streets of Chicago both energized supporters and instilled unease in others.\n\nBut headlines out of Chicago instead have been splashed with Democratic enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Gaza protests and marches, which attracted thousands of passionate demonstrators, have been significantly smaller than organizers predicted.\n\nThere's still one night to go, with the highest stakes yet for both the anti-war movement and the Chicago authorities as Harris formally accepts her party's nomination for president.\n\n– Sophie Carson, Terry Collins, Michael Loria, Tamia Fowlkes and Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat time does the DNC start tonight? Where to stream the DNC?\n\nThe convention will air live on its website, from the United Center in Chicago between 7 p.m to 11 p.m. ET (6 p.m. to 10 p.m. CT) Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nUSA TODAY will provide livestream coverage on YouTube each night of the DNC, Monday through Thursday.\n\n– Gabe Hauari\n\nDemocrats face uphill battle courting business community\n\nIn a high-rise building overlooking the Chicago River downtown, Democratic Party advocates made the case Tuesday that business leaders should step up their opposition to GOP-led threats to U.S. democracy – not for moral reasons, but economic ones.\n\n“The other party right now is so unpredictable,” said Rhett Buttle, an entrepreneur and advocate. “I think it’s a question of stability in business, and normal rule-making, or potentially chaotic markets.”\n\nIn courting the business community, Democrats have a steep hill to climb. The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies? No,” she said. “But are they scared of a leader who’s gonna go after his enemies, and reward his friends, and turn us into a banana republic? Turns out they don’t like that.”\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nKlobuchar: 'There is a lot of competition about competition'\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention last month, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s support for anti-monopoly measures set off a flurry of messaging from Democrats, as they sought to reassure voters that they, not the GOP, are the party of workers and economic progressivism.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Thursday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel. Last month, Gaza war activists released insects at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C. in an effort to disrupt the stay of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne witness staying at the Fairmont told USA TODAY the insects appeared to be crickets, while other news reports suggested maggots. Officials indicated the contamination happened around 6:45 a.m., and witnesses said all the food had been replaced within an hour.\n\nRead more on the ongoing investigation.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nWho is performing at the DNC? The Chicks expected to sing the national anthem\n\nThe Chicks, the country music group formerly known as The Dixie Chicks, are expected to perform the national anthem for the final night of the Democratic convention. The group was seen doing a sound check at the United Center on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe appearance isn’t the group’s first foray into politics. In 2003, it’s lead singer Natalie Maines said during a concert that the band was “ashamed” that President George W. Bush was from her home state of Texas.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWho is set to speak tonight at the DNC?\n\nThe official DNC Day 4 speaker schedule lineup has not yet been released.

Maxwell Frost\n\n— Gabe Hauari and Chris Sims\n\nTrump says he will provide running commentary on Harris' speech\n\nYou didn't think Trump would stay quiet during Harris' acceptance speech, did you?\n\nThe Republican nominee has announced that he will provide running commentary on Harris' address via his Truth Social website.\n\n\"I will be doing a LIVE PLAY BY PLAY,\" Trump said early Thursday on Truth Social, later adding: \"We will start at 10 P.M., Eastern, and be covering and commenting on some of the earlier Speeches made, prior to hers.\"\n\n— David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy pushes GOP at Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of Harris speech\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate and Trump campaign surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy held a news conference Thursday at Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris' speech on the last day of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nRamaswamy addressed a packed room to bash Harris' border policies.\n\n\"If only (Democrats) cared as much about keeping illegals out of our country as they do keeping their own left wing protestors out of their own convention,\" he said. \"From one kid of legal immigrants to this country to another, my message to (Harris) is 'shame on you.'\"\n\nRamaswamy called on Harris to apologize to the families of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants during her speech.\n\n\"She has an opportunity... to have a spine,\" Ramaswamy said. \"If she doesn't, it'll tell you all you need to know.\"\n\n— Sam Woodward\n\n'YYYEEEEAAAAHHH': Lil Jon makes Democratic national convention cameo for Georgia delegates in convention roll call\n\nGeorgia's delegate roll call at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday included a star cameo: Lil Jon.\n\nEach state was introduced by a DJ at the convention before announcing how their delegates cast their vote (even though the formal nomination has already happened). When Georgia was called on to cast their votes, the cameras panned to Lil Jon atop the United Center stadium stairs in Chicago.\n\n\"YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHH,\" the Atlanta rapper said as the intro to \"Turn Down for What,\" played on the speaker.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nMuslim Women for Harris-Walz disbands\n\nThe group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz announced it is disbanding after the campaign refused a request from the uncommitted movement to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"We cannot in good conscience continue Muslim Women for Harris-Walz,\" the group said in a statement. \"We pray that the DNC and VP Harris’ team makes the right decision before this convention is over. For the sake of each of us.”\n\nThe uncommitted movement has for months pushed Democratic leaders to implement an arms embargo to Israel and work toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Delegates from the group organized a sit-in outside of the convention on Wednesday, saying they would stay put until Harris' campaign allowed a Palestinian speaker on stage.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat Shyamala Gopalan's legacy means to Kamala Harris\n\nIn the story of Kamala Harris’ life, her mother steals the show. The vice president would have it no other way.\n\n“Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” “There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”\n\nGopalan, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009 at age 70 of colon cancer, won't see her daughter accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday, but she will be a strong presence.\n\nGopalan set out on her own across the world at the age of 19, defying her native culture. She raised two girls to identify both with her own background and one that was totally alien to her. She encouraged them to excel and exceed expectations but not leave others behind. And she did it all while performing important scientific work of her own.\n\nRead more on Harris and her mother's legacy in her life.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nDNC schedule Thursday: See full list of events, where to watch Democratic convention\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz visits home delegation, touts importance of today\n\nFresh off his convention floor speech, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joked with Minnesota Democrats that Thursday was an important day.\n\n\"Look, it's an important day. The eyes of the world are focused on this day because it's the day that the Minnesota State Fair opens up,\" Walz told delegates at the Fairmont Chicago.\n\nWalz thanked his home-state delegates for supporting him and his wife Gwen in recent weeks.\n\n\"We're ready to take the Minnesota values that you all taught us,\" Walz said. \"Everybody who I talk to across this country, when I talk to them, they want to be Minnesota.\"\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nWhat people are saying about Kamala Harris: 'A vibe I’m feeling'\n\nPolls suggest millions of Americans are changing their presidential voting plans with Harris currently topping the Democratic ticket, signing up for who she is and what they feel she represents.\n\nMany voters interviewed by USA TODAY find themselves surprised to be supporting the new Democratic candidate for president this year, swept up in the excitement and \"vibes\" of her campaign.\n\nThere are at least four distinct groups of Harris supporters: The Democrats who would have voted for whoever their party put at the top of the ticket; the Democrats who weren't sure they would have bothered to vote for Biden, but are enthusiastically behind Harris; the undecideds who have come down on the side of Harris; and the former Trump supporters who are excited about someone new.\n\nRead what Americans are saying about the Harris campaign.\n\n— Terry Collins, Deborah Barfield Berry and Trevor Hughes\n\nPoet Amanda Gorman, comedian Kenan Thompson among Wednesday highlights\n\nAmanda Gorman, the country's first national youth poet laureate, delivered a poem that drew applause and cheers from the audience at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night.\n\nGorman debuted a new poem called \"This Sacred Scene\".\n\n“Only now approaching this rare air are we aware that perhaps the American Dream is no dream at all, but instead a dare to dream together,” she said in one of her lines.\n\nComedian Kenan Thompson took the stage to continue criticizing Project 2025, a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation for potential new Republican administration, though Trump has continually denied association with the it.\n\n“You ever seen a document that can kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” the comedian said while holding a large hardback copy of the project.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi, Amaris Ecinas and Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris ushers in a new Democratic era, stepping out of Biden shadow\n\nAs President Joe Biden gave a tearful goodbye to the Democratic Party this week, a liberated Kamala Harris stepped out of his shadow and commandeered the national stage.\n\nThe handoff at the Democratic convention, one of several Biden farewells, was a visceral example of how the country is changing, with the first Black and Asian American woman topping a presidential ballot.\n\nNow, Harris has less than three months to convince the rest of America to entrust her with a four-year presidential term. She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in recent days, but made clear he would welcome an endorsement from the independent candidate.\n\n\"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it — I would be very honored by it,\" Trump said during an early morning interview on \"Fox & Friends\" otherwise devoted to attacking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy during the Fox interview, quite a change from earlier this year when he denounced the independent candidate as a \"Radical Left Liberal\" whose candidacy would hurt him and help the Democrats.\n\nKennedy is expected to withdraw from the presidential race later this week.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJewish Democrats have party loyalties tested in 2024 election\n\nJewish Democrats have had their party loyalties tested this election year as the left flank's support for the plight of the Palestinians has, at times, seemed to have taken on anti-Semitic undertones in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and the subsequent Gaza war that's led to an estimated 40,000 Palestinian deaths.\n\nThe pushback from the left has been on display during protests at this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Democrats nominated Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe split among Democrats and progressives over the war in Gaza is partly generational − with even some young Jewish Americans opposing Israel's war in Gaza. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has caused some younger Jewish Americans to push back at Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll in March found that 42% of American Jews between the ages of 18 years old and 34 believe the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas is \"unacceptable.\" Only 27% of Jewish Americans ages 50 to 64 years old said it is \"unacceptable.\"\n\nRead more on the divisions facing some Democrats.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin\n\nGus Walz in Wednesday night's most touching moment: 'I love you, dad.'\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice-presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has spoken openly and lovingly about his neurodivergent 17-year-old son Gus, who has ADHD, along with a non-verbal learning disorder and an anxiety disorder. Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view: Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

Bill Clinton's complicated legacy with modern Democrats: In the 1990s, William Jefferson Clinton was the boss of the Democratic Party, and considered one of the best political communicators of the age. the former president is still thought of fondly by a segments of the party who believe he could be an asset this cycle. Still showcasing the 42nd president could also backfire and aggravate younger generations of Democrats, who find it hard reconcile with Clinton's tenure scarred by an extramarital affair with an intern. That sort of misbehavior is looked at much differently among progressives, especially in the post-#MeToo era.\n\n— Phillip M.

As he seeks a promotion to vice president, he chose a folksier introduction Wednesday to Americans who had no idea who he was until Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate two weeks ago.\n\nNot a pol, not at heart. Instead, a husband and father, a deer hunter and a car guy, a social studies teacher and a basketball coach from the Gopher State who helped turn his high-school team from losers to state champions.\n\n\"I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this, but I have given a lot of pep talks, so let me finish with this,\" Walz declared to cheers as he accepted the vice-presidential nomination on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. \"It's the fourth quarter.

John Lewis and President Obama.\n\nThis is not a civil rights battle that Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., ever wanted to wage. But it's one he says he must fight – and win.\n\nAt issue is the White House's submission of a slate of six nominees for federal judgeships in Georgia – two to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and four to district court judgeships in the state's Northern District. Among the nominees is an attorneywho defended Georgia's sweeping voter ID law, which many civil rights activists say is designed to suppress black voter turnout. Another is a former state representative who votedto keep the Confederate battle flag emblem on the Georgia state flag. And the only blackamong the six nominees is a Republican woman.\n\nThere has never been a black female Democrat appointed to a federal judgeship in Georgia, Lewis pointed out during a telephone interview. \"Black women vote in a higher percentage than any other group in Georgia,\" and they vote overwhelmingly Democratic, he said. \"I think the president should do better by them.\"\n\nAt stake in this fight, opponents of the backroom deal say, are some hard-won civil rights victories that might be undermined if these appointments are confirmed. Also at risk, it seems, is the special relationship between Lewis, an icon of the 1960s civil rights movement, and President Obama, who in 2010 awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom for dedicating his life \"to shattering barriers and fighting injustice.\"\n\nLewis and two other men Obama gave the nation's highest civilian award – the Rev, C.T. Vivian and the Rev. Joseph Lowery – have joined forces to keep the Senate from confirming this controversial slate, which was born of an arcane Senate rule that gives U.S. senators the power to block a vote on anyone nominated to a federal judgeship in their state. The\"blue slip\" practice is essentially a pocket veto of a president's judicial picks.\n\nDemocrats have threatened to change this rule, just as they altered the ability of the Senate's Republican minority to use a filibuster to keep a presidential nomination from being voted on. But so far, they haven't moved beyond veiled threats.\n\nThe slate Obama has agreed to is the product of a deal he brokered with the state's two Republican senators – Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. In return for Obama accepting three Republican-backed candidates for judicial appointments in Georgia, Lewis said the Georgia Senators agree to Obama's three nominees.\n\n\"I think he's just been listening to some of the wrong people and just getting some bad advice from his legal counsel,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It's not a pretty picture. It's not easy to stand up to your president and say you got it wrong. But we've got to look beyond the next three years (of Obama's presidency). These people are going to get a lifetime appointment,\" he said.\n\nLewis is right. This fight is about the long term, not the remaining years of Obama's presidency. As important as it is to Democrats to get as many of Obama's judicial nominations confirmed as possible, it's even more important to put the right people on the bench.\n\nDuring the eight years that Republican George W. Bush was in the White House, GOP activists aggressively pushed to put right-leaning judges on the federal bench. Democrats should work just as hard to fill federal judicial vacancies with left-leaning jurists.\n\nAs it is, the deal Obama has brokered to put six more judges in the 11th Circuit appears to do more harm than good to his party -- and the nation.\n\nDeWayne Wickham, dean of Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication, writes on Tuesdays for USA TODAY.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including ourBoard of Contributors.

Foley and Barbara Rodriguez\n\nAssociated Press\n\nPublic employees in Iowa have been fired in recent months for misconduct such as theft, fraud and student mistreatment, according to records obtained under a new law that reveals those details for the first time.\n\nAn officer allegedly submitted fraudulent expense forms seeking reimbursement for 2,200 miles that he didn't drive. A clerk was accused of having 400 work records buried in her desk that she claimed she had completed. And a paraeducator who worked with children with autism allegedly mistreated a student.\n\nDocuments detailing the firings and demotions of public employees have become available under a little-noticed but dramatic change to the Iowa Open Records Act signed by then-Gov. Terry Branstad in February. The Associated Press used the law to obtain records that shed light on an aspect of public sector work that had been kept under wraps for decades.\n\nWHY HE WAS FIRED: Prior-years incidents cost Sgt. Dan Charleston his job\n\nThe Iowa open records law adopted in 1967 requires government agencies to make records available to requestors but has numerous exemptions, including one for \"personal information in confidential personnel records.\" Agencies routinely cited that provision to argue that disciplinary records were exempt from disclosure, and the Iowa Supreme Court agreed in 2012.\n\nThe amendment signed by Branstad requires agencies to release \"the documented reasons and rationale\" that employees are fired, demoted, or resign to avoid termination. The law requires agencies to notify employees that the documentation going in their personnel files may become public records after appeals are exhausted.\n\nThe change was tucked inside a larger bill that Republican lawmakers sped through both chambers cutting union rights from 180,000 public workers. The bill sparked some of the largest protests in the history of the Iowa Capitol — but few focused on the open records change.\n\nStates' open records laws are mixed when it comes to public employee disciplinary records, with some requiring disclosure all or some of the time and others declaring them confidential. The varying policies reflect a debate that pits the public's right to know against the privacy rights of employees.\n\nBranstad had long called for allowing the release of information about proven misconduct by state employees.\n\n\"If an individual is found to have done something inappropriate, failed to perform their duty or damaged another person and then is terminated or dismissed because of it... it should be public,\" Branstad said in January following the ouster of 13 employees accused of mistreating disabled residents at the state-run Glenwood Resource Center. Branstad said then his administration couldn't discuss their cases.\n\nMany Democrats and unions opposed the change. They worry employees accused of misconduct will suffer damage to their reputations and future job prospects — unfairly at times — while supervisors and political appointees will be protected since they can be fired at-will and documentation on their misdeeds won't exist.\n\nSen. Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, said she feared that those fired over a minor incident will suffer harsh consequences.\n\n\"Do we believe that people can get their act together and realize that what they did, how wrong it was, and that they won't do it again?\" she wondered.\n\nTo test the law, AP sent requests to 20 state and local agencies seeking the \"documented reasons and rationale\" for employees who have been fired, resigned or demoted since Feb. 17, the day Branstad signed the law.\n\nDetails of more than 30 cases were obtained. They included a Polk County officer who allegedly submitted inflated mileage reimbursement by listing an old home address, and a Department of Revenue clerk caught hiding uncompleted records.\n\nThe AP found some attempts to narrowly interpret the law to avoid disclosure of misconduct.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship released a letter suggesting that a secretary was fired for theft but refused to elaborate.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids Community School District released a summary that said a paraeducator who works with autistic children was terminated after \"a student under her care and supervision was not handled appropriately.\" But the district refused to release any records, insisting the limited disclosure complied with the law.\n\nThat contention drew criticism from Rep. Dave Deyoe, R-Nevada and chairman of the Labor Committee that helped draft the change.\n\n\"It's an open record and anything in the files that they have that's associated with that dismissal, should be a public record and should be turned over,\" he said.\n\nReasons why public employees in Iowa were recently fired", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/09/19/buncombe-bed-expansion-bid-1-hospital-scores-written-support-majority/69498936007/", "title": "Buncombe hospital expansion bid gets 4K support letters.

That includes a reported 388 probationary employees terminated in February and hundreds of employees who accepted the administration's initial deferred resignation, known as the Fork-in-the-Road program.\n\nIt's unknown how many EPA employees accepted the Fork-in-the-Road or the voluntary retirement offers. Before the reductions started, the agency had an estimated work force of roughly 15,000.\n\nOn April 22, reduction-in-force letters were sent to nearly 200 employees of its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, notifying them that terminations were scheduled to take effect July 31.\n\nA union that represents more than 8,400 EPA employees is pushing back against those staff reductions.\n\n\"Decimating our agency and Environmental Justice workforce goes against our oath to protect human health and to keep our planet healthy and habitable for future generations,\" Joyce Howell, executive vice president of AFGE Council 238, previously told Reuters.\n\nFind the latest news: Trump administration efforts to slash the federal workforce\n\nThe two departure programs are being offered to most employees, with some exclusions, according to the April 28 notice. It excludes workers in the offices of the chief financial officer, mission support, inspector general and enforcement and compliance assurance, employees who have received a notice about a planned reduction in force, and those in a few specific positions such as law enforcement, national security or public safety, according to the announcement.\n\nThe window to accept one of the two options will be open until midnight on May 5, according to the letter. Employees who accept the deferred resignations must leave work no later than June 16, unless there's a \"mission essential\" need for the employee to stay longer.\n\nEmployees, including full-time and part-time employees across a broad range of positions, may opt to resign or retire. The Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (known as VERA) temporarily lowers the age and service requirements for retirement, but the employees must be at least 50 with 20 years of service or any age with 25 years of federal service, according to the letter.\n\nThe letter to employees refers to Feb. 26 guidance from Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on implementing the Department of Government Efficiency's \"workforce optimization initiative.\"\n\nIs DOGE risking the government's cybersecurity? Some have lost their jobs to block them.\n\n\"The federal government is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt,\" Vought stated email, sent to the heads of all executive departments and agencies. \"At the same time, it is not producing results for the American public. Instead, tax dollars are being siphoned off to fund unproductive and unnecessary programs that benefit radical interest groups while hurting hardworking American citizens.\"\n\nVought, a key architect of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, served as the head of the federal budget office during Trump's first term.\n\nVought previously criticized federal bureaucrats in private speeches in 2023 and 2024, particularly the EPA, according to reporting by the nonprofit investigative news site Pro Publica. In a video Pro Publica obtained, Vought stated: \"We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.

The department said in a news release that only 12% of child care providers were open for business in March because of the pandemic. The department said reopening is a positive sign for parents. “This is good news at a time when many parents and guardians are gradually returning to their normal daily lives outside of the home,” Alabama DHR Commissioner Nancy Buckner said in a statement. The department said that, so far, $7 million in financial aid has been provided to 501 child care providers through the Temporary Assistance for Stabilizing Child Care grant program.

The motion filed Saturday requests contempt sanctions against Kriner’s Diner and its owners, The Anchorage Daily News reports. City attorneys said they do not want the defendants jailed but are trying to make sure the restaurant stops indoor dining service to protect the health of Anchorage residents. The motion also accuses the restaurant’s attorney, Blake Quackenbush, of encouraging and participating in the violation, arguing the lawyer should be sanctioned. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz issued an emergency order temporarily prohibiting indoor dining at restaurants and breweries as the number of confirmed cases increased. Quackenbush argued the order violates the Alaska Constitution.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Hundreds of faculty at Arizona State University have added their names to a letter online in opposition of the university’s plans to return to some in-person instruction Aug.20. Citing risks of COVID-19, a lack of transparency and other concerns, the letter asks that ASU postpone in-person instruction until it uses the state’s guidance for starting in-person classes that was released Thursday, conducts testing of all members of the ASU community, and accommodates all faculty, staff and graduate students regardless of reason. The letter also demands equal representation of faculty, staff and students on a committee that advises executive leadership on COVID-19 policy. Directed to ASU President Michael Crow and administration, the letter was created by a new group called the ASU Community of Care Coalition and was signed by more than 500 faculty, staff and graduate students from across the university’s colleges as of Sunday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state has 572 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and nine additional deaths due to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, state health officials reported Sunday. The Arkansas Department of Health said there are now 49,383 confirmed cases of the virus in the state and a death toll of 544, up from 48,811 cases and 535 deaths reported Saturday. The true number of coronavirus cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The health department said 41,452 people have recovered from the virus, and there were 7,387 active cases Sunday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California’s top public health official has resigned, just days after the state announced a fix for a glitch that caused a lag in reporting coronavirus test results. Dr. Sonia Angell said in a resignation letter made public late Sunday that she’s departing from her role as director and state public health officer at the California Department of Public Health. Her letter to staff did not give a reason for her departure. Angell often appeared during news conferences about California’s response to the pandemic alongside Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who in a statement thanked Angell “for her service to the state and her work to help steer our public health system during this global pandemic, while never losing sight of the importance of health equity.” Sandra Shewry, vice president of external engagement for California Health Care Foundation, will fill the role of acting health director, the health and human services department said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Volunteers from the public health department are sitting in vehicles outside stores, watching shoppers to see whether they’re wearing masks. Thanks to the reconnaissance, Tri-County Health Department has weekly data going back to April about the percentage of people in Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties putting on face coverings when they go out in public, the Colorado Sun reports. The data could ultimately help in figuring out whether a weekly dip in mask-wearing correlates with increasing cases of coronavirus one or two weeks later, said Brian Hlavacek, Tri-County’s environmental health director. The public health department, one of the largest in the state, is among the few conducting mask surveys. The percentages of mask-wearers, after slipping in June, have been above 90% the past two weeks – which coincides with Gov. Jared Polis’ July 16 statewide order requiring people to wear masks when indoors in public.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont criticized President Donald Trump’s executive order that seeks state money to help extend emergency unemployment benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s plan to provide an extra $400 a week in benefits requires states to kick in $100 a week. Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Lamont said the plan would cost Connecticut about $500 million through the end of the year. “I could take that money from testing,” Lamont said. “I don’t think that’s a great idea. I could take that money from, you know, mass disinfecting for our schools. I don’t think that’s a great idea.” The governor also defended the state’s plan to reopen schools without requiring regular coronavirus testing for students and teachers. He said that he believes the the state’s low infection rate will allow the state to open schools safely and that teachers could go get free tests if they wanted.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state is going to spend $40million to help residents who are struggling to pay rent or mortgages during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. John Carney and the Delaware State Housing Authority announced Monday that the state is resurrecting the Delaware Housing Assistance Program to help people who are missing payments. The program was originally launched in late March but then halted a few weeks later because it was swamped with applications. At the time, it received requests from three times more tenants than officials originally set aside funds to help. The $40 million this time around is coming from the federal coronavirus relief package that Congress passed in late March to help states cover coronavirus-related expenses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The mass shooting of 21 people at a D.C. party is calling into question the issue with large gatherings during the pandemic, and some neighbors want police to do more, WUSA-TV reports. D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said Sunday that a gathering of hundreds of people in the city’s Southeast neighborhood Friday into Saturday defied the mayor’s order to limit groups to 50 people. Despite community members circulating flyers advertising the block party days before, police said organizers did not have a permit for the party. “It’s important as a community that we have zero tolerance for this kind of activity,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday. But, when it comes to enforcement, the district’s police department said recently that it is hoping for community compliance. Newsham said the department did not have enough officers to break up this party.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Students began returning to some university campuses Monday as the state reported the fewest new daily cases in more than a month. Classes for new students started Monday at Stetson University. Students moved into dormitories over the weekend at the DeLand campus as well as at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. In Orange County, public school students started the school year Monday with two weeks of online learning. At the end of the month, they will get to choose between continuing with the virtual learning or going to in-person classes. Meanwhile, Florida reported 4,155 new coronavirus cases Monday, the smallest daily caseload increase since the end of June. The Sunshine State now has 536,961 total cases and 8,408 virus-related deaths. That marked an increase of more than 90 deaths reported in Florida on Monday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A man falsely claimed that a drug his company was selling would lower the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19, federal prosecutors said. Matthew Ryncarz and his company Fusion Health and Vitality, which operated as Pharm Origins, are accused of saying a misbranded drug called Immune Shot would lower the risk of getting COVID-19 by 50%, according to federal prosecutors in Savannah. The drug “bore false and misleading labeling,” prosecutors said in a news release Monday. A lawyer for Ryncarz did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the charges of selling a misbranded drug. “Our office is committed to ensuring that businesses do not take advantage of a global health crisis and people’s fears in order to unlawfully make a buck,” U.S. Attorney Bobby Christine said in the release.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials reported a record 231 new coronavirus cases Saturday as state and municipal officials closed beaches and parks on Oahu and restricted other activities. The statewide total of cases since the start of the pandemic in March has risen to 3,346, and newly confirmed infection cases surpassed 200 for two days in a row. Most of the cases have been in Honolulu and its suburbs. The death Friday of an Oahu man who was older than 60 was the state’s 31st fatality linked to COVID-19, the state Department of Health said. Closing Oahu’s beaches, parks and other high-risk activities will help prevent the spread of the virus, but the measures are not enough, and residents need to take responsibility in efforts to curb the virus, Anderson said. Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, plans to reinstate a requirement that people traveling between the islands quarantine themselves for 14 days, starting Tuesday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will remain in the fourth and final stage of a plan to reopen for at least another two weeks as coronavirus infections and deaths show little sign of slowing, Gov. Brad Little said Thursday. The Republican also reemphasized his desire that schools open this fall, though he said that would be up to local districts. Little said the state has sufficient health care workers, personal protection equipment, ventilators and ICU beds. He also said the state was making some progress with declining infection rates and other criteria and emphasized the money being spent to make sure schools can safely reopen, including $10 million for additional masks, gloves, sanitizer and separation glass. “The expectation is that schools will not be closed for extended periods of time during the ’20-’21 academic year,” Little said. “I genuinely understand the deep concern of some teachers and parents about returning to school for in-person instruction.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The school district in the capital city has updated its dress code policy for remote learning, saying students can’t wear pajama pants, slippers or hats while on camera when classes start this month. Springfield Public Schools officials said they hope students approach online classes the same way they would attending classes in person, and that means following a dress code that also bars hoods, sunglasses and bandannas, among other things. The district said students should also be “sitting up out of bed preferably at a desk or table” during remote learning, according to its school manual. “The expectation is that the dress code is upheld,” Jason Wind, director of school support, recently told school board members. School officials said the policy changes were developed with teachers, administrators and parents. But some parents disagree with the rules.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State public health officials on Sunday reported a fourth consecutive day of 1,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and one new death. The Indiana State Department of Health said the state has had 74,328 cases and 2,835 deaths since the start of the pandemic. More than 841,000 tests have been administered in Indiana. Students at Indiana University began moving in Sunday, in a process that will be spread out over 12 days. Before moving in, students have to undergo a COVID-19 test. Tents will be set up in Memorial Stadium, according to The Herald-Times. Those who test positive will have to return home and isolate themselves for 10 days before coming back to campus. If they can’t return home, they’ll be assigned to isolation on campus. Students who are living off campus will also have to get tested before they arrive. Classes begin Aug. 24.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: University of Iowa administrators pushed ahead Monday with plans to resume some in-person classes and on-campus housing, even as student leaders said those steps were too risky during the coronavirus pandemic. University leaders said they would not test students who will begin moving into the Iowa City campus in the coming days, unlike last week’s mass testing at Iowa State University. They have also not finalized metrics for determining whether to shut down face-to-face instruction in the event of an outbreak during the semester. But at a news conference, top administrators touted the safety measures they have put in place and said they looked forward to welcoming students. Last week, undergraduate and graduate student government leaders sent a joint letter calling on the school to offer online-only classes and limit student housing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state on Monday reported nearly 1,100 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases and another seven COVID-19-related deaths over the previous three days. The state Department of Health and Environment said Kansas has had 31,730 coronavirus virus cases since the pandemic reached the state in early March. That’s up 3.6%, or 1,092 cases, since Friday. The actual number of cases is thought to be far higher because people can be infected without feeling ill and because of a lack of testing, particularly early in the pandemic. The state health department said there have been 387 COVID-19-related deaths reported for Kansas during the pandemic, an increase of 1.8% since Friday. However, the confirmed or probable cases leading to deaths stood at 1.22% as of Monday, a low for the pandemic. Hospitalizations increased 1.9% over three days, up 36 to 1,911.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Bourbon fans will be doing virtual toasts at this year’s Kentucky Bourbon Festival. The festival’s board has shifted the event to a virtual experience because of the coronavirus to help protect the safety of distilleries and the health of bourbon fans and the Bardstown community, where the annual event is held, festival organizers said. “At this time, we know it’s the right decision to move to a new type of bourbon celebration by going virtual,” said festival Board of Directors Chairman David Mandell. “We look forward to welcoming everyone back to Bardstown for our 30th anniversary next year.” This year’s event is set for Oct. 15-18. Bourbon fans will be able to go online to view nearly 20 live and recorded “Spirits Education Sessions,” festival organizers said. All will require free registration to attend. Virtual sessions will include a series featuring master distillers teaching the particulars of bourbon making.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s legislative auditor found two rural parishes’ claims that the state was double-counting their positive coronavirus tests in the official tally of cases was unfounded, upending theories pushed in conservative circles that the data is being skewed to make the outbreak appear worse than it is. Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera’s office, a nonpartisan agency that digs into numbers for state lawmakers, said the case statistics reported on the Louisiana Department of Health’s online coronavirus dashboard “are generally correct.” “We found that none of the duplicates reported by Red River Parish were counted twice on LDH’s dashboard, and all but three duplicates identified by DeSoto Parish were not counted twice on LDH’s dashboard,” says the auditor’s report, released Thursday evening.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: An American Indian tribe plans to expand its food pantry services as it responds to the coronavirus pandemic. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians has received $900,000 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Indian Community Development Block Grant program to retrofit and expand a food service facility, Republican Sen. Susan Collins said. The expansion will establish a food pantry, Collins said. She said the expansion is important for the tribe’s efforts to combat the pandemic, which has brought economic hardship to the community. “This investment will help ensure that the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians can continue to safely provide affordable and nutritious food services on their lands during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Collins said. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs were awarded $1.8 million in HUD money last month, Collins said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSilver Spring: The state elections board voted Friday to significantly reduce the number of places where voters can cast ballots on Election Day in November, a proposal aimed at accommodating a shortage of poll workers while avoiding voter confusion and crowded precincts during the coronavirus pandemic. The five-member board’s recommendation to Gov. Larry Hogan calls for using 282 public high schools or better sites as “vote centers” where any registered voter in a particular county could cast a ballot Nov. 3. Board members also expressed support for keeping the state’s roughly 80 early-voting centers open Nov. 3. The state’s current election format calls for having roughly 80 early-voting centers and opening up to 1,800 precinct-based polling places. Vote centers would be larger forums than precincts, which could make it easier to maintain social distancing rules, according to local election officials.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Church officials say nearly a dozen Catholic schools have closed in the state this year, and more could shutter as the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic mounts. The Boston Herald reports among the recently announced closures are schools in Chelsea, Boston, Braintree, Holbrook, Lowell, Kingston, Marlborough, Methuen, Weymouth and Winchester. Thomas Carroll, school superintendent for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, told the newspaper it’s already the largest number of closures the region has seen in almost 50 years. He said Catholic schools nationwide have been dealing with declining enrollment and financial challenges for years, but they’ve been exacerbated by the pandemic. Carroll estimated Catholic school enrollment in the Boston archdiocese is down 7% from March, when Massachusetts and other states enacted widespread economic closures and social restrictions to control the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Hatch Detroit contest winners and other participants whose businesses have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic will have access to a $100,000 utility assistance relief fund created by the nonprofit. This year’s Hatch Detroit Small Business Alumni Relief Fund takes the place of the annual Comerica Hatch Detroit Contest. Hatch Detroit is a nonprofit that supports existing and new retail initiatives in Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck through funding, exposure and mentoring. Hatch Detroit’s executive director, Vittoria Katanski, said the program’s graduates have opened 44 businesses, employed more than 500 people and invested more than $7 million in their businesses since the first contest was held in 2011. Comerica has invested an additional $50,000 to provide organizational support to Hatch Detroit in 2020.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State health officials reported a decrease in the number of new cases of COVID-19 on Friday but urged residents to stay vigilant in their efforts to stop the virus’s spread by continuing to wear masks, practice social distancing and avoid large crowds. Officials also expressed worry about an increase in cases tied to long-term care facilities, saying the new cases seem to come as staff members have relaxed precautions and started attending large events such as parties, church gatherings or weddings. “This is fragile, and we are very concerned that the progress we have made can be at risk, and can even be lost, if we let up on our precautions,” said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. “We need everyone in Minnesota to be doing their part to limit transmission. We are all connected to each other.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Department of Health reported 16 new coronavirus deaths and 476 new cases Monday, bringing the total to 67,649 cases and 1,912 deaths. There were a total 175 outbreaks reported at long-term care facilities. The latest statistics available, last updated Saturday, show 4,067 Mississippians in long-term care have been diagnosed with coronavirus, and 832 have died. Mississippians in the 60-to-69 age bracket made up the largest number of hospitalizations as of Friday with 1,039. Those in the 70-to-79 age bracket made up the largest number of deaths with 497. But, by far, those in the 18-to-29 age group have the highest number of confirmed cases in the state with 14,236. Eleven people in that age bracket have died of the virus. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said positive cases of the virus have surged in recent weeks in the that demographic.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State health officials reported another 1,027 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday, continuing a trend of nearly 1,000 new cases every day since last week. The exception was Sunday, when the state recorded 475 confirmed cases. The state’s data was delayed over the weekend as health department officials moved the numbers from an old surveillance system to a new one, and health officials said Monday that another 1,073 cases were confirmed Saturday. Six COVID-19 deaths were confirmed over the weekend and none Monday. On Monday, St. Louis County health officials said they planned to survey 5,000 randomly selected residents and test them for the coronavirus. The study is planned to help health officials understand racial disparities in public health, identify risk factors for COVID-19 and educate about preventative measures that could be taken, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has surpassed 5,000 known cases of COVID-19 and has reported 75 deaths, officials said Monday. The state reported 261 cases over the weekend, including 65 on Monday, bringing the total known cases to 5,017. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. Two more residents of long-term care facilities in Billings recently died from COVID-19, Yellowstone County officials said Saturday. A woman in her 80s who had lived at Canyon Creek Memory Care died in the hospital Aug. 4. Hers was the 16th death tied to an outbreak at the facility. A man in his 90s died Aug. 5 at a senior living facility that county officials did not identify. Eighty people are hospitalized with the respiratory virus, including 44 in Yellowstone County, health department spokesperson Barbara Schneeman said Saturday.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lincoln Police closed down a bowling alley over the weekend for violating the city’s coronavirus restrictions after the owner vowed to fight the rules requiring people to wear masks in public places. On Saturday, Lincoln Police enforced the local health department’s order to close Madsen’s Bowling & Billiards for violating restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. Officials have said employees at Madsen’s Bowling & Billiards weren’t wearing face coverings, patrons were told masks were optional, and people weren’t far enough apart. The bowling alley’s owner, Benjamin Madsen, has challenged the city’s health restrictions in court. The business was ticketed Saturday for violating a closure order by operating Friday. Madsen’s attorney, J.L. Spray, declined to comment on the closure Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourism officials marked another index of the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic Friday, reporting that about 1 million people visited the Las Vegas area during June – down 70.5% from the same month a year ago. A monthly economic report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority noted that casinos were closed for 78 days before reopening four days into the month. It said that with large gatherings banned to prevent the spread of COVID-19, convention attendance was zero. Some Las Vegas resorts remain closed, and the report put occupancy of the more than 95,000 rooms available after properties were allowed to open June 4 at only about 41%. State health officials reported 976 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 statewide and 20 more deaths, bringing the Nevada total to at least 920 since the pandemic began.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s hospitals are hurting financially and bracing for cuts due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals in the Granite State collectively lost $575 million in revenue between March and July, said Kathy Bizarro-Thunberg, executive vice president of the New Hampshire Hospital Association. The group estimates hospitals will lose $700 million by the end of the year, The Concord Monitor reports. Hospitals were forced to pause lucrative nonessential surgeries and services due to the virus crisis. Alex Walker, chief operating officer at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, said the hospital laid off more than 70 employees last week, reduced hours for dozens of positions and froze hiring for all nonessential workers. The hospital expects to lose $40 million by the end of next month. “COVID has had a devastating effect on our finances,” Walker said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: Two congressmen called for the CEO of the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus to resign Monday following a story last week that showed how lax infection control and questionable decisions may have exacerbated the devastating toll COVID-19 has taken at the facility. U.S. Reps. Bill Pascrell Jr. and Josh Gottheimer called for CEO Matthew Schottlander to step down before an expected second wave of COVID-19 emerges this fall and winter. “Mismanagement and a lack of transparency at the state-run Paramus Veterans Home resulted in needless death and preventable tragedy,” the two Democrats said in a statement. The Paramus home leads the state in nursing home deaths, with 81 residents and one caregiver dying from COVID-19. It is one of the highest death tolls nationally. Almost 300 residents and staff have been infected.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Environmental regulators have ordered employers to promptly report coronavirus cases to the state. An emergency rule issued by the Environmental Department requires employers to report positive COVID-19 cases to the department within four hours of being notified of the case. The department said the emergency rule will remain in effect for up to 120 days unless a permanent rule is adopted before the end of the 120 days. “By requiring employers to report positive cases in a timely manner, the state will be able to more rapidly respond to workplaces, providing immediate guidance and support to employers and preventing the spread of COVID-19 beyond the infected employees,” the department said. However, the department said that in more than 280 instances, employers were aware of cases at least three days before the department learned of them.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday dismissed President Donald Trump’s executive orders as “laughable” and another chapter in the federal government’s botched response to the coronavirus as he praised New Yorkers for mostly good behavior that has reduced the infection rate in his state. The Democrat was particularly critical of Trump’s Saturday announcement that states must pay part of $400 weekly unemployment insurance benefits. Meanwhile, Cuomo praised New Yorkers for driving down the rate of infections so low that only 0.78% of tests performed Saturday came back positive. He said the 131 people in intensive care units also represented the lowest number since the early days of the health crisis. “It’s great news,” he said. It was not all good through: Another seven deaths were recorded. And Cuomo is trying to keep pressure on local authorities to enforce rules meant to keep crowds from bars and restaurants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: When K-12 public school students in the state resume classes this fall, the vast majority of them will be sitting at home in front of a computer screen. Despite a desire by most Americans to reopen schools at least partially for in-person learning, nearly 2 in 3 North Carolina parents were not given the choice to send their kids back for the start of the fall. Data released by the state shows at least 65% of public school students will start this academic year fully remote because their districts went with the Plan C option that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper offered in his reopening guidance. Beyond that, an unknown number of parents have opted for remote instruction in districts that allowed for a mix of in-person and online learning. “We know how important in-person school is,” Cooper said Thursday. “However, we need to put the health and safety of the children first.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nHarwood: Veterans who weren’t given military funeral rights when they were buried during the coronavirus pandemic have been given a final salute at the Fargo National Cemetery. United Patriotic Bodies and Fargo Honor Guard volunteers were at the cemetery Saturday when three rifle volleys were fired and taps were played individually for 14 different families of veterans. United Patriotic Bodies Cmdr. Jason Hicks said the salute is an honor and a duty to those who sacrificed for their country. Gary Varberg came to the cemetery to honor his brother, Roger Nelson. They served in Iraq together and decades in the National Guard, KVLY-TV reports. “Closure, maybe a little bit,” Varberg said. “Mainly to salute his military history and his duty.” Nelson was just one of the many veterans who wasn’t given military rights and honors when he was buried at the Fargo National Cemetery during the pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Unemployment claimants would receive $300 in federal weekly unemployment assistance under an option provided by the White House that doesn’t require extra state spending, the administration of Gov. Mike DeWine said. The plan agreed to late Sunday by Gov. Mike DeWine means less money for the unemployed than under another option that would provide $400 a week, with $100 coming from the state. Both options involve less than the $600 a week in federal pandemic aid that recipients were receiving until their expiration Aug. 1, with Congress unable to agree on an extension. Ohio recipients will still receive regular state unemployment benefits under the plan. The new federal benefit might not take effect until later this month while Ohio seeks guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor for implementing it, said DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported 397 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Monday and two additional deaths. The latest numbers from the Oklahoma State Department of Health bring to 43,963 the number of confirmed cases in the state since the pandemic began in March. The death toll now stands at 605. Meanwhile, one of the state’s largest hospital systems is reporting an alarming increase in the number of pregnant women testing positive for COVID-19. Integris Baptist Medical Center reported Monday that doctors have delivered 24 babies from women who have the coronavirus since June 30. Prior to that, the hospital had not cared for any expectant mothers with COVID-19. The health system has not reported any maternal or fetal deaths related to the virus.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Out-of-state travelers will be charged more while camping at state parks to help recoup some losses during the economic downfall caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department announced a 30% surcharge on nonresidents who make new camping reservations or arrive at a state park campground beginning Monday. Under the surcharge, the average cost for a full-service recreational vehicle site for nonresidents will increase from $33 a night to $42 a night, and the average tent rental fee will increase from $19 a night to $23 a night. The additional fees are temporary and will remain through 2020, officials said, adding that it could raise about $500,000 to help hire staff, pay for cleaning supplies and support other operations. It is similar to the extra fees most states add to fishing licenses purchased by out-of-state residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Under pressure to give schools more health guidance about how to safely reopen, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that it will provide recommendations to school districts based on the local rate of transmission of the coronavirus. The Department of Health plans to provide an analysis showing the seven-day rate of transmission in each county and group those rates into three categories: low, moderate and substantial. The department’s recommendation on how to reopen would be based on those categories. So, for areas with a low transmission rate, districts could adopt a partly remote or a full in-person instruction model. For areas with a moderate transmission rate, districts could adopt a partly remote or fully remote instruction model. For areas with a substantial transmission rate, the department would recommend a fully remote instruction model. Most districts will be in the moderate category.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state registered one more death from COVID-19 and 176 newly reported positive cases over the weekend, state health officials said Monday. The state Department of Health also said 93 people are currently hospitalized with the virus, the highest total in more than a month. Eight of the patients are in the intensive care unit, and two are on ventilators, the agency said. The new cases bring the state’s coronavirus death toll to more than 1,000 and its total cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic started to nearly 20,000. In recent days Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo has been enacting tougher social and economic measures to control the spread of the virus as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is calling on the state health department to report any COVID-19 cases among students and staff in public schools. The Department of Health and Environmental Control should develop a process to collect and disclose cases in every school district in the state, McMaster wrote Monday in a letter to DHEC Chairman Mark Elam. That data, stripped of identifying information to comply with confidentiality laws, should be reported on a daily basis, he said. A spokesperson for the health agency said it intended to fulfill the governor’s request. At least eighteen districts will start classes next week, according to reopening plans approved by the state education department. Currently, schools are only required to notify students and families who were in close contact – within 6 feet for at least several minutes – with someone who tested positive, state Department of Education spokesman Ryan Brown said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls School District may be short of bus drivers when school begins later this month. School Bus Inc. holds the contract to transport Sioux Falls students to and from school by bus, and manager Jim Shafer said concerns about the coronavirus pandemic are partially to blame for the shortage. Shafer said in a normal year, the district would still be looking for 10-15 drivers. He said it’s about double that number this year. Shafer said driver applications are coming in, but there are background checks, physicals and other tests that potential hires need to complete. Shafer said that “the district has done pretty extensive stuff” in the way of precautions. Those safety efforts include an expectation by the district that drivers wear masks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Election officials have updated the absentee ballot application for November to reflect that the state Supreme Court eliminated an expansion of mail voting during the pandemic. Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office said voters who have underlying health conditions particularly susceptible to COVID-19 can get absentee ballots by selecting the “illness or physical disability” on the application. The application doesn’t mention underlying conditions or COVID-19, but the secretary of state’s website does. Voters themselves will determine under penalty of perjury whether their underlying conditions qualify. In a news release, Hargett and Elections Coordinator Mark Goins said that “if a voter is too ill to go to shopping centers, Walmart, Home Depot, or other public places then they are probably too ill to go the polls and conversely, if you are going to those other places then common sense would indicate the voter is well enough to go to their polling place.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State Attorney General Ken Paxton advised Friday that local governments’ attempts to delay evictions for renters grappling with the COVID-19 recession amounted to rewriting state law – something they can’t do, he said in nonbinding legal guidance. “While local officials do possess certain emergency powers ... statewide eviction procedures far exceed the requirement that those powers be exercised ‘on an appropriate local scale,’ ” Paxton said in a letter. “Government Code does not authorize local governmental entities operating under a declared disaster to independently rewrite state law as it applies to their jurisdiction to prohibit, delay, or restrict the issuance of a notice to vacate.” Paxton’s letter, in response to a question from Republican state Sen. Brandon Creighton of Conroe, seems to chide local officials like Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who last month extended the eviction moratorium in the city until Sept. 30.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Federal inmates who have sued a jail and alleged a failure to adequately protect them from the coronavirus will not be able to seek immediate release through a habeas corpus petition, a judge ruled Friday. Six people charged with federal crimes and held at Weber County Jail in Ogden filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court last month, asking for more inmates to be released to home confinement and for additional health measures, such as mandating masks and providing hygiene supplies. Attorney Benjamin McMurray, whose office represents more than 100 jail inmates, said during a court teleconference hearing Friday that his clients are being punished and put into disciplinary confinement if they continue to report symptoms. Frank Mylar, who represents Weber County Sheriff Ryan Arbon, said some of the inmates lack any legal standing because they have already contracted the virus “and moved on.”\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: As the first group of Norwich University students has arrived on campus, some students have failed to follow coronavirus-related safety guidelines, the military school said. Some cadets apparently broke the rules of the school contract, school officials told WCAX-TV, but they would not elaborate on which ones. President Mark Anarumo plans to meet with those students early this week to discuss consequences, Norwich officials said. Students who break the contract may be asked to leave campus, officials said. Under the contract, students agree to follow certain safety measures, including abiding by occupancy limits in dormitories and common areas as well as physically distancing and wearing a mask in public spaces. On-campus students may not leave the campus without approval. Approximately 400 to 500 students were expected to return to campus this past weekend and were required to quarantine based on state guidelines.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hundreds of thousands of applications for mail-in ballots that a voter advocacy group sent to voters in Virginia had the wrong return addresses, adding another complication for state election officials who are already hard-pressed to pull off a smooth election in a pandemic. The Virginia Department of Elections said the return envelopes were addressed to the wrong election office, which would force election officials to forward the applications to the correct office for processing. Meanwhile, the department said anyone wanting to vote absentee should apply for a ballot through the state’s website. The problem mailers were sent by The Center for Voter Information, a third-party group not affiliated with the state, the department said in a news release. The Washington-based group, which says it’s a nonpartisan organization aiming to increase voter participation, had mailed over 2 million applications, The Washington Post reports.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: New guidelines for fitness centers and gyms went into effect in the state Monday in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. KING TV reports under the updated guidelines, gyms and fitness facilities will need to nearly triple the minimum distance required for patrons exercising indoors, except for those practicing certain team sports. The new COVID-19 guidance issued by Gov. Jay Inslee for counties in Phase 2 or 3 of reopening increases the requirement of 6 feet of distance between patrons to 300 square feet, which is just over 17 feet of space. Showers, hot tubs, saunas and tanning beds at multi-use facilities will be closed, as will steam rooms, squash courts and racquetball courts. Locker rooms will also be limited for handwashing and restrooms only. All patrons will also be required to wear facial coverings while inside indoor fitness facilities, “except while engaged in strenuous exercise.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: The New River Gorge National River is increasing access and services that were stopped in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Park Service is using guidance from federal authorities and state and local health officials as it monitors the pandemic and increases access. The park was reopening access beginning Saturday to Grandview Sandbar Campground, Glade Creek Campground and Stone Cliff Campground. Backcountry camping, hiking trails, river and river access points, vault toilets at heavy visitor use areas and group picnic shelters at Grandview continue to be available. Facilities that remain closed include visitor centers, vault toilets at less popular areas, group campsites, and campgrounds at Army Camp, Brooklyn, Gauley Tailwaters, Meadowcreek, Thayer and War Ridge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s voters have requested more than 900,000 absentee ballots for Tuesday’s primary, more than seven times what they requested in the August primary in 2018, according to data state elections officials released Monday. The sheer volume of applications is another sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact as voters try to avoid infection at the polls. According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, voters had requested 903,760 absentee ballots and had returned 506,709 as of Monday. That compares with 2018, when they requested 123,393 ballots and returned 106,663. Tuesday’s primary includes nearly 30 legislative races and two Republican primaries for congressional seats in southeastern Wisconsin’s 5th District and western Wisconsin’s 3rd District. No statewide offices are on the ballot.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Workers closed the state’s last operating oil rig last week. It is just the second time since 1884 that the state has had zero gas rigs in operation, according to Pete Obermueller, the executive director of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. “It is historic, but not in a great way,” Obermueller said. “There are so many jobs attached to these rigs, and now, people are painfully learning so much revenue is attached too. It’s mind-boggling and hard to capture the impact.” The organization estimates that one lost rig means roughly 100 lost jobs, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. This year, diminished demand for oil due to the coronavirus pandemic and a global price war have depleted production. In April, oil future prices turned negative for the first time in history. The state relies heavily on revenue from fossil fuels. The collapse in energy prices and the pandemic have led state analysts to predict a $1.5 billion revenue decline.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/28/marion-polk-counties-provide-free-child-care-families-during-court-hearings/603437001/", "title": "Marion, Polk counties to provide free child care during court hearings", "text": "Every day, parents and caregivers need to attend divorce proceedings, sex abuse trials, domestic violence hearings and restraining order filings.\n\nThose proceedings, Brent DeMoe said, are no place for a child.\n\nBut being unable to pay for, or find, child care often means families are faced with difficult options: bring their young child to the hearing, leave them unattended in the halls outside the courtroom or skip their hearings, said DeMoe, director of the Polk County Family and Community Outreach Department.\n\nSometimes, children see their parents led away in handcuffs, or witness custody and domestic violence disputes.\n\nStarting Sept. 5, Mid-Valley CourtCare will begin providing free, licensed child care to anyone with court-related business in Marion and Polk counties.\n\n\"This is a current reality for families in Marion and Polk counties,\" he said. \"Children should not have to be in the room while legal proceedings are taking place.\"\n\nThe new service, which is available for children ages 6 weeks to 12 years old, will provide a safe, supportive environment that lets children be children, DeMoe said.\n\nNo more hotels?

In the 2017 session, House Bill 3067, which allocated $200,000 for the program, passed with no opposition in the Oregon House and Senate. Gov. Kate Brown signed it into effect on Aug. 8.\n\nThe bill received wide, vocal support from local lawyers, judges, nonprofits, prosecutors, victim assistance programs and government officials.\n\nDozens testified on the difficulties faced by parents unable to find child care during court proceedings.\n\nA Polk County woman recounted her struggle with bringing her 5-month-old baby to court. As a victim, she needed to attend multiple release hearings and pretrial proceedings following the death of her oldest son, but she could not afford child care.\n\nShe'd wake up early before each hearing, feed and change her baby and take him to court, diapers in tow. Often, she'd have to leave the courtroom when he was fussy or needed to be changed.\n\n\"Not only did I have this beautiful baby to take care of, I was mourning the loss of my first born, who was 15 months old,\" she said. \"Having to take my second son to court caused me to hide my emotions and lengthen my healing process.\"\n\nVictim assistance employees did their best to help her through the difficult process, but they were unable to sit with her and explain the case when she was forced to leave the hearing.\n\n\"If there would have been free, licensed care for my son, I would have been able to grieve easier and not be so worried about when I would have to leave the room next,\" she said.\n\nVictims can sometimes feel like they are on the sidelines in their own case due to the lack of safe, reliable child care, said Kim Larson, director of Marion County's Victim Assitance Division.\n\nPolk County Judges Sally Avera and Norman Hill also wrote a letter in support of the bill.\n\nThe judges preside over mental illness and drug abuse treatment courts, eviction cases and family abuse cases.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for parents to bring their children to court,\" they wrote. \"These are often very young children who have difficulty sitting still and being quiet.\"\n\nParents are often distracted, placing them at a \"distinct disadvantage.\"\n\nPolk County District Attorney Aaron Felton echoed those sentiments during his testimony.\n\n\"In my experience, one of the most common obstacles people face in meeting their conditions of probation or other court-ordered obligations is the lack of available, affordable child care,\" he said.\n\nAs a prosecutor, he said he has both the responsibility to not only to seek justice by holding offenders accountable, but to also be supportive of those trying to be accountable by removing unnecessary roadblocks.\n\n44 children left in harm's way: Oregon's child welfare agency struggled to fix problems\n\nFamily law attorney Katherine Denning said in her testimony that her clients never want to expose their children to the messy details of their divorce or separation, but are frequently forced to. Sometimes hearings must be rescheduled, and her clients have to take more time off from work and school.\n\n\"Especially for low-income families, these inconveniences happening too many times can mean the loss of their jobs, which further exaberates the problem,\" she said.\n\nFunding from individuals, law firms, the Oregon Women Lawyers Foundation, nonprofits, the YMCA of Marion and Polk Counties, Family Building Blocks, the Dallas Resource Center and legal organizations is expected to cover another $100,000 in CourtCare costs.\n\nIn Marion County, CourtCare will be operated by the Salem Family YMCA and will be available to anyone with court-related business or a court appointment. The program will run from 8 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through Thursday.\n\nFamily Building Blocks will operate Polk County CourtCare at the Academy Building in downtown Dallas.\n\nAnyone with business in the court system — including jurors — or local social services agencies like Polk County Behavioral Health, public health, department of human services or housing can use the service between 1 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays and from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Wednesdays.\n\nFurther information is available www.midvalleycourtcare.org.\n\nFor questions, comments and news tips, email reporter Whitney Woodworth at wmwoodwort@statesmanjournal.com, call 503-399-6884 or follow on Twitter @wmwoodworth\n\nAmazon to open packing, shipping center in Salem, hire 1,000\n\nPolice investigate drowning at Dallas Aquatic Center\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/23/stay-home-orders-spiking-numbers-liquor-boom-news-around-states/111459836/", "title": "Stay-at-home orders, spiking numbers: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Health officials in the state’s largest county on Sunday ordered the closure of nonessential businesses, including hair salons and many retail stores, to curtail the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases in the state grew to more than 155. Jefferson County Health Officer Mark Wilson said he was issuing the amended order to clarify what businesses should and should not be open. Clothing stores, barber shops, gyms, hair salons and department stores are among those that should close beginning at 5 p.m. Monday. Grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, and hardware and office supply stores are among those that can remain open but should maintain social distancing practices. “I want to be very clear. This is a matter of life and death,” Wilson said in a Sunday night message. “I need your help, using good judgment, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: The city is considering whether to allow cruise ships to dock there while waiting out the global ocean cruise suspension because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. The Ketchikan City Council discussed allowing cruise operators to pay for space and services at its downtown berths during the nearly industrywide suspension, The Ketchikan Daily News reports. At least one cruise line approached the city about docking multiple ships at the berths, Ketchikan Port and Harbors Director Steve Corporon said. Cruise Line International Association, accounting for 95% of the market, announced March 13 that its member lines planned to suspend cruises for 30 days. “It’s kind of like 9/11 with the airplanes,” Corporon said. “The infrastructure wasn’t there to land all the airplanes at once. (It’s) similar here. The infrastructure isn’t in place to have all the cruise ships in port.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cases of COVID-19 have spiked more than 50% in one day, the state Department of Health reported Monday. It confirmed 235 cases in the state, up from 152 on Sunday. Two men, one in his 70s and one in his 50s, have died. Both had underlying conditions. The spike came as Banner Health opened several coronavirus testing sites in the state. The Arizona-based health care provider announced that three drive-up sites in metro Phoenix and one in Tucson were up and running. More were in the works. People who believe they may need testing must first call a hotline to talk to medical personnel. If they are found to meet the criteria, they will be assigned an appointment time at a drive-thru site. Once at the site, clinic staff will take a swab from a patient’s nose. The entire process takes between five and 20 minutes.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Arkansas Community Foundation is accepting proposals for $1,000 mini-grants for organizations responding to the immediate needs of vulnerable populations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These grants will help organizations maintain their operations and respond to increased demand from clients during this first phase of pandemic relief. Nonprofit organizations with 501(c)(3) status, churches, hospitals, schools or government entities based anywhere in Arkansas are eligible to apply. Priority will be given to organizations that provide human services and emergency assistance; primarily serve vulnerable populations, including children who are out of school and families without child care, people who have lost a source of income due to the pandemic, people who are at high risk medically, people who are homeless or incarcerated, and individuals who lack paid sick leave or health insurance; and disseminate factual safety and response information to vulnerable communities such as non-English speaking residents, rural residents, senior citizens, etc.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Sunshine lured crowds to beaches and parks Sunday despite a statewide stay-at-home order, prompting more closures as officials announced plans to ramp up testing procedures for the coronavirus. Santa Monica closed seaside parking lots to discourage people from visiting its famous strand, and Los Angeles was expected to do the same starting Monday in neighboring Venice Beach to curb the virus’s spread. Most people on the sand took care to heed guidelines to stay 6 feet away from others. But spacing became an issue in popular areas like the Venice boardwalk, causing Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to chide visitors for being “too close together, too often.” Dozens of Los Angeles-area parks, trails and facilities overseen by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority were closed down Sunday. In the San Francisco Bay Area, authorities shut Drakes Beach, Agate Beach and other popular coastal spots, including Point Reyes Lighthouse and Chimney Rock Headlands.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis on Sunday ordered non-critical businesses to cut the number of employees working together in offices and other workplaces by at least half. He also urged state residents to also do their part to reduce their potential exposure to the coronavirus by doing things like only shopping once a week and jogging less frequently and at different hours. Polis said the state will set an example, with more than half of its employees who do not work in round-the-clock operations, like prisons, working from home starting Monday. He urged private employers to decrease workplace density by allowing telecommuting when possible or staggering shifts if it’s not. The order for private employers will take effect Tuesday with exceptions for several industries, including health care, manufacturing, banking and infrastructure.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: The state’s first triage tent for treating those believed to be infected with the coronavirus was set up outside the emergency department at UConn’s John Dempsey Hospital. UConn Health says the tent is not a testing center but will be used if the expected surge in COVID-19 patients occurs to give hospital staff additional workspace. Patients who are stable will be sent home and educated on how to quarantine there. If doctors determine they need more testing, treatment or admission, they will be sent inside the hospital to be treated in an isolation area. The hospital also has a separate drive-by testing site, which is open by appointment only. Meanwhile, New Haven officials say they have concerns about how a homeless man who tested positive for COVID-19 and was under a quarantine order at Yale New Haven Hospital was able to walk away before being found more than eight hours later in Milford.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Dover Air Force Base has issued a shelter-in-place order effective Tuesday. The order, issued by 436th Airlift Wing Commander Col. Matthew Jones, means all Dover Air Force Base personnel must shelter in their place of residence unless obtaining food, caring for an immediate relative, participating in outdoor activities such as walking or running, or seeking necessary health care. Additionally, all personnel must practice social distancing of at least 6 feet or more. “While I know these measures provide a great deal of inconvenience, they are the safest course of action to ensure COVID-19 spread is limited and Team Dover remains safe,” Jones said in a statement. People are still allowed on base, as long as they have Department of Defense identification. Also, the commissary is operating on a blocked schedule, said Technical Sgt., Chuck “Dragline” Broadway, a base spokesman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has ordered D.C. police and members of D.C. National Guard to limit people’s access to the National Mall’s Tidal Basin cherry blossom trees until further notice, WUSA-TV reports. Restricted access went into effect Sunday for the Tidal Basin, along with several street closures, to ensure social distancing and prevent further community transmission of COVID-19, Bowser said in a news release. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic are also being restricted in the area of the National Mall. Metro officials have closed two nearby stations, Smithsonian and Arlington Cemetery, to discourage people from heading down. The Trust for the National Mall is livestreaming the trees on its “Bloomcam” so people can see them from the comfort of their home. The National Arboretum is also open. It has many varieties of cherry trees, magnolias and wide-open spaces perfect for social distancing.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that he wants to avoid imposing a statewide lockdown like many other states have done, saying he still believes targeting the counties hardest hit by the coronavirus for the most extreme measures is the preferable path. DeSantis said about a third of Florida’s 67 counties have no confirmed cases, and another third have few, so he doesn’t yet see the need to impose a near-shutdown on their businesses as has been imposed in large counties such as Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where the disease has spread into the community. Most of the counties with few or no infections are smaller ones along the state’s northern borders or surrounding Lake Okeechobee. DeSantis said he doesn’t want to cause unnecessary financial hardship or create unintended consequences such as people fleeing the state and spreading the disease.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Counties continued to place restrictions on businesses and gatherings Monday, as cases of the new coronavirus increased. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has ordered schools shut but has refrained from taking stronger steps like ordering restaurants and nonessential businesses to close, instead leaving the decision to local governments. By noon Monday, confirmed cases in the state rose to 772, up from the 620 cases the state was reporting Sunday, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health. The death toll remained at 25. Metro Atlanta’s DeKalb County, which has 75 confirmed cases, is the latest county to order restrictions aimed at helping to slow the spread of the virus. DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond issued an executive order Monday that prohibits gatherings of 10 or more people, closes playgrounds and asks all residents to shelter in place “as much as possible.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: All walk-in locations for the Hawaii Democratic presidential primary that were scheduled for April 4 have been canceled. An additional round of mail-in ballots will be added for those who are registered to vote with the state of Hawaii and are enrolled in the Democratic Party by April 4. Results will be released in late May.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With more than five dozen confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state Monday, agencies, businesses and schools continued to work to slow the spread of the illness. Boise State University urged students to move away from dormitory-style housing if they can and – like the University of Idaho, Idaho State University and other higher education institutions across Idaho – has moved all classes online. Officials with the West Ada Public Schools District, the largest in the state, are working on a remote learning plan in case schools need to be closed for an extended period. Central District Health, which serves the Boise region, on Sunday asked any Ada County residents who have recently traveled to Ketchum, Sun Valley, Hailey or surrounding areas to shelter in place for two weeks, and health officials in eastern Idaho asked residents who traveled to the same area to call for further instructions.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Ten people were shot during weekend attacks on Chicago’s South and West sides, despite a statewide order that took effect requiring people to stay indoors because of the coronavirus pandemic. One of the 10 people who was shot died, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Last year, four people were killed and 10 others wounded in shootings over the course of the same weekend. “Our response is identical to what it was a year ago,” police spokesman Anthony Gugielmi told the newspaper. “We will not diminish our ability to respond to violence in the city because we have a crime fight that we’re in right now, and every single day it’s very important to us to try to make the city safer.” Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s order to stay at home took effect Saturday evening. The directive, which will last through April 7, requires the state’s 12.6 million residents to remain in their homes, except for essentials.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb on Monday ordered residents to remain at home for two weeks starting Wednesday, except for workers in essential industries or needed trips for groceries and medicine, to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Holcomb’s order, which mirrors orders in adjacent states, begins at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday and ends April 6, but he said it could be extended if needed for the state’s 6.8 million residents. Holcomb said the next two weeks “are critical if we are to slow the spread of COVID-19,” the disease caused by the coronavirus. “Get groceries only when you need them, and only buy what you need.” The governor’s office said residents who are asked to report to work during the two-week period but who believe that business is not essential should discuss that with their employer.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Authorities have been taking steps to cut the number of inmates in the state’s prisons and jails, citing concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus. The disease it causes, COVID-19, has yet to be confirmed in any Iowa prison or jail, officials said. But it poses a particular menace to overcrowded prisons and jails, ACLU spokeswoman Veronica Fowler said. “There is no ability to self-distance. Meanwhile, people are coming into the jail all the time. People are coming in, coming out. You really have just a tinderbox for COVID-19 to spread rapidly,” Fowler said. The Iowa Corrections Department is expediting the placement of about 700 prisoners who are approved for parole or work release, according to spokesman Cord Overton. Maj. Bryce Schmidt, Scott County Jail administrator, said a judge has reduced terms for some elderly inmates, some inmates with respiratory issues and some close to finishing their sentences.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shelter-in-place orders are about to take effect for about a third of the state’s population to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and more could soon follow. Douglas County, which includes the college town of Lawrence, announced its order will take effect Tuesday. That will match soon-to-take-effect orders that were issued in neighboring Kansas City-area counties, including Johnson, Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties. People will still be allowed to leave their homes for essential needs, such as health care and grocery store visits. In Sedgwick County, government staffers were drafting an order for people in the state’s largest city, Wichita, to stay at home amid the coronavirus pandemic, even though the county’s top public health official says it is not necessary now, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Sunday ordered nonessential retail businesses to close in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Beshear said the move is effective at 8 p.m. Monday and includes businesses such as entertainment, clothing, bookstores, jewelry stores and car dealerships. He said auto repair and parts shops are exempt, and businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies, drug stores, liquor stores and gas stations will remain open. “This is the next step that we need to take to reduce the contacts to Kentuckians until we defeat this virus,” the Democratic governor said. Beshear also said he is mandating that all hospitals cease elective procedures, and the vast majority already have. Some other states have ordered residents to shelter in their homes, but Beshear said that has not been discussed. “Shelter in place evokes emotions in us that (there is) a deadly chemical spill near our house or even an active shooter,” Beshear said. “It says get in your house and board it up until we call you. That’s not the way that we will address this coronavirus.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The number of state residents confirmed to be infected with coronavirus spiked Monday to nearly 1,200 people, and the virus’s death toll grew dramatically overnight, in a troubling trend that had Gov. John Bel Edwards enacting a statewide “stay-at-home” order and planning a televised plea that evening for people to comply. At least 34 residents have died from the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, according to Louisiana’s health department, up from 20 confirmed deaths a day earlier. Edwards ordered his state’s 4.6 million residents to voluntarily stay at home starting at 5 p.m. Monday unless they need to carry out essential tasks such as getting food or medicine. First responders and workers in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ offices and other critical operations are exempt from the directive, which will remain in effect until at least April 12.\n\nMaine\n\nBath: A shipbuilder at Bath Iron Works has tested positive for the new coronavirus, and others who came into contact with the worker will have to self-quarantine, the company said. The shipyard’s medical staff is working with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure the safety of the workforce, and the Navy shipbuilder continued manufacturing Monday. The worker was last at the shipyard March 13, the company said. The shipyard in Bath, along with Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, a submarine repair yard in Kittery, Maine, serves a critical national security function under the president’s guidelines. All told, nearly 90 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, according to the Maine CDC.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Liquor sales are booming in parts of the state as the coronavirus spreads. Renee Zacharias, manager of Ballenger Beer and Spirits, told the Frederick News Post over the weekend that business is triple what it usually is this time of year. She said customers have said they’re stockpiling beer and liquor in case stores are shuttered as they have been in other states. For example, Pennsylvania ordered liquor stores to close last week. Cotton Rudy, co-owner of Rudy’s Welding Service and Cold Beer in Middletown, said business has increased about 50%. “I think because of the coronavirus, we ran out of everclear alcohol because people have been using it as hand sanitizer,” Rudy said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker ordered all nonessential businesses to close by Tuesday afternoon and remain closed until at least April 7 in an effort to slow down the spread of the new coronavirus. The Republican governor also said Monday that the state Department of Health has issued a stay-at-home advisory but stressed that it wasn’t a shelter-in-place order. “Everyone is advised to stay home and limit all unnecessary activities,” he said at a news conference. “We’re asking everyone to use their common sense, think about the impact this virus is having on the sick and elderly, and to limit their interactions with other people.” He said it was OK to take a walk at the park while keeping appropriate social distancing but advised against pickup basketball and touch football games. Although medical marijuana facilities will be allowed to stay open, recreational pot shops are considered nonessential and must close, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the coronavirus, with exemptions for certain workers, outdoor exercise, and trips to the grocery store or hospital. Whitmer warned of dire results akin to those seen in Italy if people don’t follow her order. More than 1 million Michigan residents, she said, could need a hospital bed if the virus isn’t controlled. “We have about 25,000 acute beds in Michigan. Think about that,” the governor said. COVID-19 deaths in the state have climbed to at least 15, and the number of people infected with the coronavirus has topped 1,200. “This disease can’t spread person to person if we’re not out there. … Too many people are still out and about unnecessarily, so we must do more,” Whitmer said. She said schools will be closed until at least April 13, extending the shutdown by a week.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has eliminated its backlog of coronavirus tests that were waiting to be processed, thanks in part to help from the Mayo Clinic, officials from the Minnesota Department of Health said. State infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann said the Mayo Clinic stepped in to help process tests, and the state should now be able to get back to patients with their results much faster. The priority will be to notify patients who test positive for the new virus first, the Star Tribune reports. “We believe that we can now keep pace with the volume of priority-population testing,” she said. “We thank Mayo for their assistance.” Minnesota’s number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus rose to 169 on Sunday, up 32 from a day earlier. One person has died from COVID-19. Officials say the total number of people with the virus is likely much larger, since the state’s public health lab has tested only 4,680 people.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Several medical facilities in the state are now providing coronavirus testing to people with fever and “severe cough or chest pain,” and screening began Monday for people to get appointments for a drive-thru testing site that opens Tuesday on the Mississippi State Fairgrounds. Gov. Tate Reeves led a prayer session Sunday on Facebook and suggested that people avoid congregating in large groups, but he has not ordered business closures or limits on social behavior, in contrast to a growing number of other governors. “‪Stay home if you can. Avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. Stay safe. Look out for your neighbors,” Reeves wrote Monday on Facebook. Reeves, who last week ordered public schools to remain closed until at least mid-April, said that “‪we will have more orders and actions very soon – following the lead of our experts.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Residents of the state’s biggest cities have been ordered to stay home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, which sickened nearly 130 people statewide, including at least five people linked to a suburban St. Louis preschool. The shelter-in-place order in St. Louis took effect Monday, a day before such orders were set to be enforced in the Kansas City and St. Joseph areas. The orders call for residents to remain in their homes unless they have a vital reason to go out, such as to go to the grocery store or pharmacy. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, had sickened 128 Missouri residents as of Sunday, which was up from 75 on Saturday. Three people have died. Meanwhile, CoxHealth’s president and CEO, Steve Edwards, urged Greene County and the city of Springfield to order stricter isolation requirements. “In an epidemic we are generally making decisions two (weeks) behind (given the incubation period),” he tweeted Saturday. “By this time in about 7-10 days COVID will be endemic and our hospitals will start to fill. Act right now!”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: There were 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state as of Monday morning, remaining steady from numbers released the prior afternoon. Gallatin County now has the most cases, with 10 confirmed incidents of the respiratory illness that is now a pandemic. There are three cases each in Cascade and Lewis and Clark counties. Also on Monday, the state’s two U.S. senators said 16 Montanans who were stuck on the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship are returning to the mainland United States. The ship, which carried about 2,000 passengers, docked Sunday in Honolulu, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The ship had to cut short its 23-day cruise of Australia and French Polynesia because many ports were closed due to the coronavirus, the ship’s owner, Norwegian Cruise Line, said in a statement. Both senators said their staffs had been in contact with the passengers.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Sandhills Global, the Lincoln Independent Business Association and the Nebraska Retail Federation have jointly announced the launch of a website to support local businesses during this time of uncertainty. The new site, NebraskaBuyLocal.com, provides communities across the region with an opportunity to purchase gift cards and gift certificates from local and independent businesses. Over the past several days, many Nebraska businesses have had to make significant changes in day-to-day practices for delivering goods and services to customers. As businesses devote significant time and resources to serving their customers during the coronavirus outbreak, NebraskaBuyLocal.com is designed to make it easier for them to reach more customers online. There is no cost to businesses for posting their gift cards or gift certificates for sale. Businesses can visit the website to sign up, and proceeds from all gift cards go directly to their accounts.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor has announced the formation of a task force to marshal private resources to help the state fight the coronavirus. Gov. Steve Sisolak said the challenge of fighting the virus “requires some out-of-the-box approaches.” He appointed former MGM Resorts International chief executive Jim Murren as the leader of the group. Murren has a deep knowledge of the casino business as well as many other skills, the governor said. “There couldn’t be anyone better than Jim Murren in leading this effort,” he said. Sisolak also cited what he said was Murren’s good relationship with Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House’s coronavirus effort. Murren led MGM from 2008 to last month, when he stepped down as chairman and chief executive. Nevada now has 190 cases of the coronavirus after 33 more tests came back positive, state officials said Sunday. The death count remained at two.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials announced the first death from the coronavirus Monday. State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan said at a news conference that the Hillsborough County man, who was over the age of 60, had multiple chronic health conditions and died over the weekend. More than 100 people in the state have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. About a dozen have been hospitalized. Gov. Chris Sununu also said that Southern New Hampshire University will be the first of eight “clinical flex areas” set up around the state where COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment can recover. The goal is to increase bed capacity at hospitals for those who are the most ill, he said. Meanwhile, the mayors of the state’s two largest cities – Manchester and Nashua – are asking the governor to require all but those who provide essential services to stay at home.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court has ordered that some county jail inmates be released in an effort to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. Chief Justice Stuart Rabner signed an order late Sunday that allows inmates serving in county jails to be released this week. Prosecutors can file objections to the release of specific inmates and have a judge hold a hearing. Rabner’s order came after the state public defender’s office petitioned the court, arguing that keeping inmates detained posed a public health threat. Officials in Hudson County said Sunday that two inmates had tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a modified lockdown of the facility. The order doesn’t apply to inmates serving in state prison on more serious crimes. Released inmates will have to serve out the remainder of their sentences when the public health emergency concludes, state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has given orders to establish a coronavirus testing site in each of the state’s 33 counties, a top public health official told a call-in forum Sunday. State Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel said she received the order to expand testing facilities on Sunday to counties with as few as 700 residents, as positive tests for COVID-19 mounted in the Albuquerque area and extended for the first time to Lea County in the oil-producing southeast corner of the state. The number of positive test results for the coronavirus climbed to 65 on Sunday, with 51 of the confirmed cases in adjoining Bernalillo, Sandoval and Santa Fe counties. The state lists 20 available coronavirus screening sites in 14 cities, with most offering drive-thru assessments and testing. “We are prioritizing the southern part of the state, and I hope that we have more sites available to you soon,” Kunkel said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The number of positive coronavirus cases in the state has surged to more than 20,000, with more than half the cases in New York City, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The city has emerged as a worldwide hotspot for the outbreak, with more than 12,000 known cases. Cuomo said the swift climb in numbers also is due to aggressive testing. The state is now testing 16,000 people a day, the governor said. There have been 157 deaths in New York state. And there have been more than 2,500 hospitalizations in the state, with 621 ICU patients. State and city officials expecting a wave of more patients are scrambling to add more hospital beds. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that he spoke with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence about the city’s urgent need for medical supplies to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “I appreciated the focus of the conversation, but what I need to see is the real material support for the people of my city, 8.6 million people who are right now in the crosshairs,” de Blasio said on CNN.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced on Monday tighter assembly and business restrictions in an attempt to dull the spread of the new coronavirus, including the extended shuttering of K-12 schools until mid-May. Cooper said he would issue a new executive order that would make it a misdemeanor for assemblies of more than 50 people, compared to the current prohibition of over 100. Cooper’s order also will direct all hair salons and barber shops, gyms, movie theaters and similar businesses offering activities that run counter to social distancing to close by 5 p.m. Wednesday. And public schools statewide will now remain closed for in-person instruction until May 15. He had already ordered closings of at least two weeks beginning March 16. “I know that these actions cause hardship and heartache for a lot of people but are necessary to save lives,” Cooper said at a news conference. State health officials counted as of Monday morning nearly 300 positive COVID-19 cases, an increase of over 40 compared to Sunday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials reported two additional cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the state’s total to 30. Four of those people are hospitalized, the Department of Health said. The new cases are a woman in her 30s from Burleigh County who picked it up through travel and a man in his 40s from Pierce County who was in close contact with another case. The state has had 1,325 negative tests.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has more than 350 cases of the new coronavirus and three deaths. Two nursing homes, in Troy and Tipp City, have confirmed cases, while Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton confirmed its first case over the weekend. The state is limiting testing to those who are hospitalized and to health care workers. The Ohio Department of Health says people with suspected symptoms should call a medical provider first but seek immediate help if symptoms are serious, such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Beginning Thursday, all child care centers in Ohio must operate under a temporary Pandemic Child Care license and follow guidelines including no more than six children in a class and one teacher to no more than six children. Last week, nearly 140,000 Ohioans filed unemployment insurance claims in one week. State officials say these numbers dwarf any previous unemployment claims.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Now is not the time for a statewide shelter-in-place order due to the coronavirus, Gov. Kevin Stitt said, as the number of people in the state confirmed with the virus now stands at 81. “We’re hearing of stuff happening in New York City, in California or Chicago,” Stitt said during a Sunday evening news conference. “We have a different set of facts here. I’m not saying it couldn’t happen.” The state Department of Health announced a second death in the state due to the virus Sunday and said Monday that the number of cases rose from 67 on Sunday. The death is a man in his 50s who lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa County, where the first death was reported last week.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state reported another COVID-19 death Sunday, Gov. Kate Brown banned residential evictions during the virus outbreak, and beachfront communities continued telling visitors to leave. The death was reported in Linn County, bringing the total coronavirus fatalities in Oregon to at least five. There are at least 161 confirmed cases. The new death was a veteran in his 90s who tested positive March 11 and died at the Oregon Veterans Home. He had underlying medical conditions. Meanwhile, Brown issued a temporary moratorium on residential evictions for failure to pay rent. “The last thing we need to do during this crisis is turn out more Oregonians struggling to make ends meet from their homes and onto the streets,” Brown said in a statement. The governor said she was looking for a way to help landlords meet their financial obligations as well.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered residents of the state’s hardest-hit areas to stay home for at least two weeks to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused six deaths statewide. He also shuttered all schools statewide for an additional two weeks. Noting that Philadelphia has already ordered residents to remain home, Wolf issued his own stay-at-home order for the counties around the city; for Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh; and for Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains. Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19. In all, 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, have been ordered to stay home. Wolf said residents will be able to leave their homes for “allowable activities,” including trips to the grocery store and the pharmacy.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSmithfield: A local factory is ramping up production of specialized face masks in response to the federal fight against the new coronavirus. Honeywell announced Sunday that it plans to hire 500 people at its Smithfield plant to produce millions of N95 disposable respirators to help support the need for critical safety equipment. The face masks will be delivered to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and are a critical piece of personal protective equipment for health care, safety and emergency response workers. “We are honored to support the U.S. government’s efforts to protect Americans with personal protective equipment made right here in the United States,” said Darius Adamczyk, Honeywell’s chairman and chief executive officer. The Smithfield factory produces eye protection products, including safety glasses, goggles and face shields. Rhode Island had 83 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as of Sunday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An employee at Boeing’s South Carolina production facility has tested positive for COVID-19, the company said Monday. Boeing spokeswoman Libba Holland said the employee was quarantined and being treated. Holland also said Boeing had asked all workers “who were in close contact” with that employee to self-quarantine at home and monitor themselves for any symptoms. The case is the first to be confirmed at the facility, where the aerospace manufacturer assembles its 787 Dreamliner jet. According to Holland, about 7,000 workers work at the North Charleston plant. As of Sunday, there were 195 known cases of COVID-19 in the state and three deaths.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order Monday setting a baseline for decision-making related to the novel coronavirus in the state. “We are doing this now because we do have community spread in South Dakota in several counties,” Noem said. Lyman, Hughes and Beadle County have seen community spread, Noem said. The Hughes County case is an inmate in the women’s prison, Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon confirmed. The state has sent about 700 low-priority tests to commercial labs, she said. The order is intended to set a baseline of guidance for businesses owners, community members and health care providers. The order states the actions businesses “should” take if they want to continue operating in South Dakota during the pandemic, but Noem didn’t respond to a question about what consequences would ensue for businesses who don’t implement changes. She also left any additional measures up to local municipalities.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases quickly rises, there’s no set plan in place for how the state will respond to uninsured patients who will inevitably need treatment for the highly contagious, sometimes fatal illness. Gov. Bill Lee said last week that his office is in discussions with the federal government “about the opportunity to explore” using TennCare funds to pay for hospitalization and other treatment related to COVID-19 for Tennesseans who don’t have health insurance and don’t qualify for Medicaid. But his administration, including TennCare, has not offered any specifics on the arrangement the state is attempting to negotiate with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that hospitalizations due to pneumonia caused by COVID-19 will range from $10,000 to $20,000.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An order by the governor to stop all nonessential surgeries has unleashed a new battle over access to abortions during the coronavirus pandemic. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statewide order Sunday to curb the use of medical supplies hospitals will need as they prepare for escalating infections in the spreading of COVID-19. The order bars hospitals from performing surgeries unless the patient faces an immediate risk for “serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician.” An Abbott spokesman confirmed that would cover abortion in most cases while the order is in place until April 21. Texas anti-abortion activists hailed the move amid the COVID-19 crisis. “The abortion industry has been consuming and hoarding medical supplies that are in desperate need around the state including masks, gloves, and other protective gear for medical professionals,” Texas Right to Life said in a statement Monday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah congressman who has the new coronavirus was hospitalized over the weekend, and a state lawmaker was also diagnosed with the disease. Democratic U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams was treated with oxygen in an isolation unit after suffering severe shortness of breath Friday evening, he said in a statement. Afterward, he reported feeling “relatively better” and said he expected to be released from the hospital as soon as his doctors allow. Meanwhile, Democratic state Sen. Luz Escamilla was separately diagnosed with COVID-19 on Friday evening. She has experienced symptoms and is quarantined along with her family, she said late Sunday. The Capitol was cleaned and disinfected after lawmakers finished their work March 12, Senate President Stuart Adams said as he sent best wishes to Escamilla and her family. Staffers have been working remotely since then.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The president of the University of Vermont says remote instruction will continue for the rest of the spring semester, and graduation is unlikely to happen as planned, to help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus. In a letter to students and staff on Monday, UVM President Suresh Garimella said students currently living in residential halls should return home. Students, except those approved for emergency housing, will not have access to rooms, their possessions or associated facilities after March 30. Garimella says UVM will work with students who may not have viable alternatives to provide emergency housing options. UVM is also encouraging non-local students living off campus to go home. The school will issue housing and meal credits and plans to make a decision about commencement by the end of March.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s public schools will remain closed for the rest of the current school year, and certain types of businesses, like bowling alleys, gyms and theaters, must close in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Ralph Northam said Monday. Northam’s order would not apply to businesses deemed essential, including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. His announcement comes as the number of people testing positive for the virus continues to rise. As of Monday, there were 254 confirmed cases in the state and six virus-related deaths in Virginia, officials said. On Sunday, Northam gave a sobering timeline of efforts to diminish the intensity of the outbreak, warning that life as we’ve known it will be disrupted “for a long time.” The governor had previously ordered a two-week school closure, which was set to end at the end of this week.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus continues to spread in the state, and a Bellingham health care center was hit especially hard. On Monday, Boeing announced it was shutting down its Seattle-area production facilities for two weeks. Health officials reported Sunday that there have been at least 95 coronavirus deaths in Washington state and nearly 2,000 confirmed cases. Shuksan Healthcare Center, a skilled nursing center, had 29 new cases confirmed Sunday, according to the Whatcom County Health Department. The Bellingham Herald reports 23 of the new cases were residents, while six were Shuksan employees. State and local leaders continue to urge people to stay at home and practice social distancing, but not everyone is following the advice. People have hit the trails, parks and beaches despite warnings.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Most court hearings in the state have been rescheduled to April after the Supreme Court of Appeals issued a judicial emergency amid the coronavirus pandemic. The high court on Sunday ordered hearings throughout the state to be postponed until April 10. “We believe it is our responsibility to limit such in-person contact to the fullest extent possible while ensuring that our courts address emergency matters necessary to protect the health or safety of our individual citizens and our communities,” Chief Justice Tim Armstead said. The administrative order allows for so-called emergency proceedings such as initial criminal appearances, coronavirus-related matters and child abuse cases to be held, preferably through video conference or telephone. The Supreme Court’s announcement came a day after it said a judicial employee who works in Kanawha County tested positive for the virus and has been hospitalized.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers said Monday that he will order the closure of all nonessential businesses starting Tuesday and is urging people to stay at home to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus that has killed four people in the state and infected hundreds. The order from Evers, which he is calling “safer at home,” comes after he already ordered K-12 schools and a host of other businesses closed, including bars, restaurants and hair salons, and limited gatherings to no more than 10 people. But the newer, tighter restriction mirrors what others across the world and U.S., including neighboring Illinois, have done to try to force people not to leave their homes or interact with others unless absolutely necessary. There were many unanswered questions about the order, including the full list of exemptions and how long it would be in place.\n\nWyoming\n\nArapahoe: The Wind River Reservation has recorded its first known case of coronavirus, but health officials doubted it was the only one. The unidentified person, whose condition wasn’t disclosed, was tied to a cluster of cases among residents and staff at a Lander assisted-living center, according to Wind River Family and Community Healthcare. Wind River Family and Community Healthcare is one of two facilities on the reservation funded through the Indian Health Service, Wyoming Public Radio reports. The Northern Arapaho share the central Wyoming reservation with the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. As of Monday, 26 people have tested positive for the virus in the state. There have been 10 cases in Fremont County, where most of the reservation is located, according to the Wyoming Department of Health.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2016/12/17/crisis-lincoln-hills-juvenile-prison-years-making/95383518/", "title": "Crisis at Lincoln Hills juvenile prison years in making", "text": "Patrick Marley, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nIrma — Shirtless and handcuffed, the 17-year-old inmate stood in the hallway of the segregation unit, refusing to go into his room.\n\n“You want to do something, do it now!\" Kenyadi Evans snapped at two guards.\n\nWhen a third guard arrived, Evans sized her up. “I'll beat your ass, too,” he said.\n\nGuard Jeff Butler had heard enough that chaotic night, one like so many other nights at the trouble-plagued Lincoln Hills School for Boys. He shoved the teen into the room and slammed the door, smashing his foot.\n\nOut of frustration, Butler punched the metal door so hard that he broke his hand.\n\nBefore driving himself to the hospital, the four-year Lincoln Hills veteran sat in his truck and cried, prison records show.\n\nInside his room, Evans screamed and held up his foot so the staff could see the bleeding. The Milwaukee teen had lost parts of two small toes, but it would take prison officials nearly two hours to take him to a hospital 15 miles away.\n\nHe would eventually require multiple surgeries and the partial amputation of the two toes.\n\nIt was Nov. 29, 2015.\n\nIt had been 46 months — nearly four years — since a judge alerted Gov. Scott Walker that prison officials had waited hours to take an inmate who had been sexually assaulted to a hospital. Twelve months since the Department of Corrections had launched an internal investigation. Ten months since criminal investigators had opened their own probe. One month since prosecutors had told a court they believed children were being abused.\n\nSix days after Evans' toes were crushed, state agents descended on the facility, located 30 miles north of Wausau. The raid began to lay bare problems that would result in the departure of a dozen employees, spark an FBI investigation and deepen concerns about the state's justice system for juveniles who commit serious crimes.\n\nThe night Evans was injured made clear that public officials — from front-line guards to the governor — had for years missed or ignored numerous warning signs about a facility descending into disorder.\n\nOn the way to the hospital, Evans boasted, said the guard who drove him there.\n\n“He was talking about how much money he was going to make,” retired guard Doug Curtis recalled. “‘Boy, I’m going to make some money off of this. You’re going to pay.’”\n\nIndeed, within a year taxpayers would give Evans a $300,000 settlement to avoid a lawsuit.\n\nPODCAST:The latest on the crisis at Lincoln Hills\n\nRELATED: Facing problems, Missouri revamped juvenile justice\n\nProblems fester\n\nFor years, officials knew or should have known about the thicket of problems at Lincoln Hills and its sister facility on the same campus, Copper Lake School for Girls.\n\n“It all went on in plain view of the Department of Corrections, but nobody at the Department of Corrections knew how juvenile corrections worked or how Lincoln Hills operated or what was going on,\" said Troy Bauch, who until recently was the union representative for workers there.\n\n“Nobody cared.”\n\nThe sweeping criminal probe, now nearly 2 years old, is examining allegations of prisoner abuse, child neglect, sexual assault, intimidation of witnesses and victims, strangulation and tampering with public records. A separate internal investigation uncovered four incidents where inmates' bones were broken.\n\nThe crisis at Lincoln Hills is rooted in systematic breakdowns, lax management, confusion over policies, a lack of communication and chronic staff shortages, a review of more than 1,000 pages of records and dozens of interviews by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found.\n\nOfficials trained staff improperly, failed to preserve video evidence, didn't document serious incidents, and often shirked their duty to report matters to parents, police and social service agencies.\n\nThe shortcomings intensified in 2011 when the Walker administration shut down two youth prisons in southeastern Wisconsin to save $25 million a year. The move put all of the state's serious teen offenders in one facility — hundreds of miles from most of their families.\n\n“The entire climate went from mildly hellish to the ninth ring of hell,\" said Timothy Johnson, a former guard.\n\nWhile a developing crisis quickly became apparent, no one moved to address it.\n\nAfter nearly six years in office, Walker has yet to visit Lincoln Hills.\n\nA prison with an unassuming name\n\nOpened in 1970, Lincoln Hills is surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with razor wire. Inmates live in dorm-style cottages that dot the campus near the small town of Irma. They attend school year-round in a central building.\n\nThe state tries to give the facility a different atmosphere than adult prisons. Inmates are referred to as youth, guards as youth counselors. Residents hang Halloween and Christmas decorations to try to give it a homey air.\n\nLincoln Hills generally holds inmates as young as 13 and as old as 25, separated by treatment and education needs. Most inmates are in their mid to late teens; some adults are being held for crimes they committed as juveniles.\n\nAbout 145 boys are in Lincoln Hills and 20 girls in Copper Lake. The two areas are separated by fences. Holding an inmate costs more than $100,000 a year.\n\nMost of the inmates are African-American and come from Milwaukee — 215 miles and 3½ hours away. The staff is largely white and from the rural north.\n\nUnlike the state’s overpopulated adult prisons, there is plenty of room at Lincoln Hills. The prison was built to hold more than 500 inmates.\n\nTypically, the inmates have committed serious, violent crimes — including homicide and robbery — or have had repeated run-ins with the law and didn’t turn their behavior around after being sent to group homes.\n\n'A caged dog'\n\nThe mother of one Milwaukee teen had mixed feelings when her son was sent to Lincoln Hills in 2014 at age 15. She worried about him being there but knew he needed serious intervention.\n\n“(He) was at that point of no return,” said the mother, who spoke to the Journal Sentinel on the condition that her name not be used.\n\nThe boy was first arrested at 13 after breaking into a friend’s house. Before long, he broke into a school to try to steal computers. He ran away from group homes, once stealing a car.\n\nAt Lincoln Hills, he was frequently sent to segregation for beating others. Guards often doused him with pepper spray, his mother said.\n\n\"It felt like my son was a caged dog, not a child or a man,” she said.\n\nIn August, a staff member filed a report claiming the boy had attempted suicide by tying a shirt around his neck.\n\nNo one from Lincoln Hills notified the mother — a problem that repeatedly has cropped up at the juvenile prison.\n\nShe found out three months later, from a delinquency services official for Milwaukee County.\n\n“When I got this letter, I almost had a heart attack,” she said. “My child tried to commit suicide and nobody told me? I would’ve walked, if I had to, up to Lincoln Hills and been there for him to find out what would make him want to harm himself.”\n\nHer son, now 17, later said he had not attempted suicide but had covered his face with a shirt because he was about to be hit with pepper spray. She said she believed her son because he had never tried to hurt himself before.\n\nA Department of Corrections spokesman said parents are notified only if an injury occurs.\n\nWhen she contacted Lincoln Hills to find out why she hadn’t been told of the incident, she was told she would get a call back that day.\n\nShe is still waiting for that call.\n\nShutting down a prison\n\nNumbers drove the decision to consolidate the state's juvenile inmates at Lincoln Hills.\n\nIn 2004, the state’s youth prisons held 668 inmates on a typical day. By 2011, the figure had dropped to nearly half that.\n\nThe reduction, which mirrored national trends was due to several factors. Fewer juveniles were being arrested. When they did get in trouble, they were increasingly being placed in community-based settings instead of prisons.\n\nIt no longer made financial sense for the state to run three secure facilities — Lincoln Hills, Ethan Allen School in Waukesha County and Southern Oaks Girls School in Racine County. In 2010, Gov. Jim Doyle formed a task force to figure out what to do and concluded a juvenile prison should close.\n\nEthan Allen was older, its grounds were smaller and the facility was more expensive to run than Lincoln Hills. At the time they were closed, Ethan Allen and Southern Oaks together cost nearly $33 million a year to operate. Lincoln Hills cost about $19 million.\n\nIt was also easier to close Ethan Allen than Lincoln Hills. A state law requires a juvenile prison to be maintained in northern Wisconsin.\n\nFormer Republican state Sen. Clifford \"Tiny\" Krueger, a tavern keeper in Merrill who had performed in the circus because of his girth, inserted the measure into state law more than 40 years ago, recalled Jim Moeser, a former juvenile corrections official.\n\nNo such law applied to southeastern Wisconsin, even though most juvenile inmates come from the state's most populated region.\n\nDoyle's task force said if a facility was to be closed, there should be careful planning for the transition.\n\nWhen Walker took office in January 2011, he moved quickly to close Ethan Allen and Southern Oaks.\n\nThe consolidation saved $25 million a year. Like other changes the Republican governor made early in his tenure, the move was overshadowed by the mass protests spawned by Act 10, which weakened collective bargaining for most public employees.\n\nAs juvenile justice experts around the nation were recommending smaller, more localized facilities, Wisconsin went in the opposite direction, consolidating operations in a remote setting.\n\n\"This is a 19th century or early 20th century model, where you have a large state-operated facility hours away from the urban centers,\" said Jeffrey Butts, director of a research center at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\n\"It is profoundly ineffective and wasteful.\"\n\nA rocky transition\n\nMore than 100 inmates were transferred to Lincoln Hills over several months in 2011, almost doubling the population.\n\nLincoln Hills got approval to bring on more than 100 new employees, but the institution was chronically short-staffed because of the challenge of hiring prison workers in a sparsely populated area. Supervisors forced employees to work double shifts, and living units were often operated with fewer employees, providing workers with less backup.\n\nThere were so many double shifts employees sometimes had trouble staying awake on their drives home, guards said.\n\n“We got people walking around like zombies,” Curtis said in a recent interview as he reflected on his time as a guard there. “They want to know when they’re going to sleep again.”\n\nThe influx of new inmates created fights and arguments, as the teens sought to establish where they stood in the prison’s pecking order.\n\n“I would come in at 6:30 and by 6:31 I’d have a couple guys on the floor in handcuffs,” said Johnson.\n\nGuards, meanwhile, were angry because Act 10 made them pay more for their benefits, cutting a typical worker's take-home pay by 8.5%. With the loss of collective bargaining, they also had less say in how the prison was run.\n\nAround this time, prison officials instituted a philosophy that calls for using restraints less often and trying to talk inmates through their problems when they act up instead of isolating them. Guards were skeptical.\n\nPaul Westerhaus, who for years played key roles in running Lincoln Hills, admitted to internal investigators in 2015 that he didn't recognize the scope of the problems that were developing or move to fix them. The abrupt consolidation threw the staff into disarray, and the institution didn't have a solid training program to deal with it, he said.\n\nHe also attributed the problems to an inmate population that had more mental health issues and was increasingly aggressive. Having one facility made it tougher to separate inmates who clashed because they couldn't be transferred to another prison.\n\n“It's almost like it began a perfect storm, and it just sort of went and grew from there,” he said.\n\nWarnings arrived early\n\nIn February 2012, Racine County Circuit Judge Richard Kreul did something he'd never done during 18 years on the bench. He wrote the governor a letter about one of his cases.\n\n\"I'm sure reading the attached memo will shock you as much as it did me,\" he wrote.\n\nThe memo Kreul sent to Walker described an incident in which an inmate from Racine was forced to perform oral sex on his roommate and then beaten unconscious.\n\nWorkers learned of the assault at 4 p.m. They didn’t get the victim medical treatment for three hours.\n\nThe delay happened in part because other inmates were playing a basketball game, according to a Racine County human services report.\n\n“What did you want us to do, stop the game?” Lincoln Hills psychologist Paul Hesse asked with a chuckle when a Racine County official inquired about the sexual assault and beating, according to county records.\n\nThat night, more than six hours after the assault was discovered, hospital workers — not prison staff — reported the assault to the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department. The offender was ultimately convicted of the beating and sexual assault.\n\nRacine County officials were tipped to the assault by another youth, but only got details from Lincoln Hills officials after making repeated inquiries. In response, Racine County dramatically scaled back sending juveniles to Lincoln Hills.\n\nThe day after the assault, Lincoln Hills officials sent the victim to segregated housing for disruptive behavior. It was that detail — punishing the victim — that prompted the judge to write the governor eight months after Ethan Allen School was consolidated into Lincoln Hills.\n\nHis memo was addressed to the governor, but Walker's aides said they never showed it to him. At the time, he was fighting for his political life during a recall election sparked by Act 10.\n\nNo one was disciplined for the handling of the assault. Department of Corrections officials told county workers they were retraining employees, but they did not get back to the judge himself.\n\n\"Zero,\" said Kreul, who is now retired. \"I got nothing back. I would not have sent the letter if I thought it was going to go to the circular file. ... I thought somebody would say, 'This merits some real investigation.'\"\n\nAt the time of the sexual assault and delayed response, Westerhaus was the prison’s superintendent and John Ourada its deputy superintendent.\n\nWalker's team promoted the pair two years later, in 2014.\n\nRed flags reach Milwaukee\n\nWarning signs went up in Milwaukee County in the fall of 2014.\n\nRobin Dorman, the public defender in charge of the Milwaukee office, discovered one of her clients wasn't being sent to class or receiving treatment at Lincoln Hills. She soon learned that inmate wasn't the only one.\n\n“To me, it was a complete breach of trust,\" she said. “It’s called Lincoln Hills School, and our kids weren’t receiving an education.”\n\nDorman alerted Children's Court Judge Mary Triggiano and Tom Wanta, who was in charge of delinquency services for Milwaukee County.\n\nDorman soon found out about allegations of abuse, fights and using segregation even when a psychologist recommended against it.\n\n“Management is aware of all of these problems. Typically, when management becomes aware of a problem, the problem just gets worse,” one of Dorman's colleagues wrote in a memo.\n\nDorman passed that memo onto Milwaukee County Chief Deputy District Attorney Kent Lovern, who forwarded it to the Department of Corrections.\n\nThe department launched an investigation but hit a snag because Dorman said she couldn't provide more details, citing confidentiality rules. Internal investigators said they couldn't move as fast as they would have liked because they didn't have names or dates.\n\nNevertheless, corrections officials were soon convinced crimes by staff had occurred at Lincoln Hills. In January 2015, aides to Attorney General Brad Schimel agreed to launch a criminal probe.\n\nSeven months later, Corrections Secretary Ed Wall got a personal alert that problems were continuing. On a visit to Lincoln Hills, teens thronged around him in the library.\n\n\"They're torturing us,\" they told Wall.\n\n\"Numb about the whole situation\"\n\nOn every one of his shifts as a guard, Johnson would sharpen his 911 knife — a fishhook-shaped device workers use to cut ligatures if inmates attempt to choke or hang themselves. He used it so much it would quickly dull.\n\n“There were so many suicide attempts on the girls’ side that you would lose track,” Johnson said in an interview with the Journal Sentinel. “One girl would hang herself, all the sudden you’d have four or five copycats.\"\n\nIt wasn't just suicide attempts. Inmates would harm themselves in other ways, cutting themselves with anything they could find and sometimes jamming pencils or plastic silverware into their wounds to make them worse.\n\n“To work in a place like that and deal with so many tragedies, you do become sort of numb about the whole situation,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson quit in January amid an investigation into inmates being injured. He contends he did nothing wrong.\n\nOct. 1, 2015, was a tense night in one of the cottages at Copper Lake. The workers weren’t getting along, and the inmates were screaming at each other.\n\nGuard Lisa Brener turned on a large fan to drown out the arguments and try to calm the girls to sleep. Some complained they were cold.\n\nOne 15-year-old girl said if the fan stayed on, she was going to “tie off” — slang for hanging or choking herself. Guard Scott McKenna saw on a camera that the girl, who was in Copper Lake for robbery, had covered herself with a blanket.\n\nWith a supervisor's permission, he went in the room and took the blanket to make sure she wouldn't hurt herself under it.\n\nFive minutes later, she was covered with a mattress. This time, McKenna didn't ask permission to go into her room.\n\n“You’re not my daddy,” she screamed when he walked in. “You can’t tell me what to do.\"\n\nThe girl stood up suddenly. McKenna, who is almost a foot taller, pushed her against the wall with his hand on her neck, the girl and two guards later told investigators. The girl looked petrified but didn’t say a word, Brener said.\n\nMcKenna told investigators his hand was just below the girl's neck, on her clavicle.\n\nMcKenna threw her mattress into the hall. As the girl came up to him, he pushed her back with his forearm, according to investigators' reports.\n\nThe girl’s mother learned of the matter from the girl and a social worker, the mother said.\n\n“I don’t want anybody putting hands on my kids, especially ones who are supposed to be protecting them,” she said.\n\nThe next day, McKenna was put on paid leave. He stood by his decision to go into the girl’s room to get the mattress even though he didn’t have permission.\n\n“I would rather be explaining this than why a kid is dead,” McKenna told internal investigators.\n\nThe Lincoln County Sheriff's Department recommended District Attorney Don Dunphy charge McKenna with child abuse and strangulation. Dunphy consulted with Schimel's office, but more than a year later has not pressed charges. Dunphy said he hasn't been kept up to date on the matter since the FBI took over the overall investigation of Lincoln Hills.\n\nThe Department of Corrections fired McKenna but reversed course and allowed him to quit.\n\nIn a settlement with the state, McKenna is banned from seeking employment with the Department of Corrections again. Under the deal, he also got $6,000 from taxpayers.\n\nImproper training\n\nAssaults at the prison often were linked to poor training — including by Lincoln Hills' use-of-force expert.\n\nFor 10 years, Dusty Meunier was the lead trainer at Lincoln Hills, but he trained staff improperly, investigators found. Security Director Bruce Sunde and Meunier's other bosses either didn't notice or didn't do anything to stop him.\n\nIn teaching workers how to break up fights, Meunier showed a video of a guard putting his knee in the back of a young inmate — without telling them the technique was improper and could cause suffocation or death. Investigators later found the knee-to-back move was routinely used by staff.\n\nMeunier was supposed to emphasize to workers that they needed to be careful when handling juveniles because their bones could break more easily than those of adults. He didn’t do that.\n\nMeunier didn't contact nurses when inmates were injured. He changed techniques for securing inmates without getting permission from his superiors. He reviewed incidents that appeared abusive but deemed them appropriate. He didn't require staff to file reports documenting when they used force despite policies that require them.\n\nMeunier himself was ultimately found to have violated work rules in 16 incidents between 2013 and 2015. He was fired in May 2016.\n\nIn one July 2015 incident, Meunier led a group of guards as two of them blasted a dorm room with pepper spray after an inmate barricaded himself inside.\n\nThe cloud of pepper spray was so thick that it drove several staff members from the area. Meunier told the inmate to lay on the floor when he was ready to be removed. Staff took his roommate out but left the inmate inside on the floor.\n\nHe was left in the room with no one watching for almost six minutes. When the guards returned, they had him crawl into the hall because the pepper spray was so thick in the air they didn't want to enter the room.\n\nA review conducted months later concluded the incident was \"abusive since it appears (the boy) was intentionally left in the room for this period of time and that (he) was willing to cooperate with staff.\"\n\nRetirements followed by raid\n\nThe Justice Department investigation had been going on for almost a year when Evans' foot was mangled in the door. Two agents were on it, but only worked it part time.\n\nAsked if more resources should have been dedicated to the investigation early on, Schimel said, \"Yeah. Hindsight's 20/20.\"\n\nThe pace of the investigation picked up when Evans was hurt. Within days, state Department of Justice agents began seizing video from the institution's recorders.\n\nPrison leaders didn't know what was going on.\n\n“What is this all about?!?” Deputy Superintendent Wendy Peterson wrote Ourada, the superintendent, in a Dec. 2, 2015, email when she learned of the Justice Department visit.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Ourada and juvenile corrections director Westerhaus had integral roles in running Lincoln Hills. Now they were left out of the loop — and wouldn't get back in.\n\n“Not sure what this is about,” Westerhaus emailed Ourada and Peterson when they learned guards from adult prisons would be brought in to monitor Evans, instead of Lincoln Hills staff.\n\nWesterhaus and Ourada earlier had announced they would retire. But they abruptly moved up that timetable, retiring within days of Evans' foot being crushed.\n\nThey received their full benefits and were granted special permission to immediately cash out their unused leave time, with Westerhaus receiving $35,000 and Ourada $66,000.\n\nTwo days after they cleared out their offices, about 50 state law enforcement agents and attorneys descended on Lincoln Hills. Within weeks, they would hand the investigation over to the FBI.\n\nAgents cut off the phone lines and told workers coming off their shifts that Saturday morning that they could not leave.\n\nPrison staff members aren’t supposed to bring cellphones into the institution, but some did. They called and texted friends and family to tell them what was going on.\n\nThe agents interviewed workers and remained on site for weeks to talk to about 250 inmates. Eventually, they would conduct hundreds of hours of interviews.\n\nEven as the raid unfolded, calamity flared in the prison. Hours after agents arrived, staff at Copper Lake found a 15-year-old inmate unconscious. The girl had taken pills and tried to hang herself.\n\nThe raid and the incident that led to it blindsided Milwaukee County officials, who had been given assurances by the Department of Corrections that their concerns were being addressed.\n\n“We were tired of getting surprised,\" said Triggiano, the children's court judge.\n\nButler and another guard who had been on the scene when Evans' toes were smashed were put on paid leave. Butler quit within days.\n\nThe following week, chief psychologist Vincent Ramos was fired for having taken pictures of interns in a hotel room while wearing only his underwear and a T-shirt. He had been investigated — but not disciplined — months earlier for commenting that a teenage inmate's breasts looked \"rode hard and put away wet.\"\n\nSince November 2014, eight employees have been fired and 14 have resigned or retired amid internal investigations. Some of those departures are not related to the initial abuse allegations, according to the Department of Corrections.\n\nWalker replaced Corrections Secretary Wall with Jon Litscher, who had run the department a dozen years earlier. Litscher promoted Peterson to superintendent, but new people were put in place in the top ranks of the prison and the department's central office.\n\nIn response to the problems, Department of Corrections officials installed 60 more surveillance cameras and equipped guards with body cameras. They began holding weekly meetings to review major incidents. They dramatically increased training.\n\nTo help combat the staffing shortage, Litscher raised entry-level wages by 80 cents, to $16 an hour. The pay increase was seen as a welcome starting point by staff who had their take-home wages cut as part of Act 10. This year, the state has hired more than 40 new guards at Lincoln Hills.\n\nIn November, the prison ended a decades-long practice of having guards dispense medication. Those duties were handed over to nurses after guards accidentally gave inmates the wrong prescription drugs several times.\n\n“The dynamic is 100% better,” Department of Correction spokesman Tristan Cook said of changes that have been adopted in the last year.\n\nBut the chief judge of Milwaukee County, Maxine White, said her confidence in how Lincoln Hills is run has yet to be restored. After she visited Lincoln Hills in January, she called the facility inhumane.\n\n\"I saw a detention facility,\" she said in a recent interview, noting state law emphasizes the importance of rehabilitating juvenile delinquents.\n\n\"They were in their rooms. Nothing was going on. There was no activity. Nothing. For $300 a day, we were getting housing. But in the juvenile code, that's not the deal.\"\n\nThis month, Walker told Milwaukee County officials he is open to having the state help pay for building a local 36-bed juvenile corrections center to help it limit how many kids it sends to Lincoln Hills.\n\nThe idea is still in the early stages, and it's unclear if lawmakers will sign onto the plan.\n\nQuiet federal probe\n\nThe internal investigation of Lincoln Hills was completed in the spring of 2016, but criminal and civil investigations remain open. The FBI hasn't visited the prison for nearly a year.\n\n“People would be sorely mistaken if they thought we were not continuing this investigation,” said John Vaudreuil, the U.S. attorney for Wisconsin's western district.\n\nThe case is taking so long because it is complex, he said. Agents are using a computer program to link incidents mentioned by inmates in hundreds of interviews, he said.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division is reviewing whether there was a pattern of civil rights violations at Lincoln Hills.\n\nIf the department makes such a finding, the federal government could sue the state and force changes under the watch of a judge — an expensive endeavor that has compelled other states to reform their juvenile justice systems.\n\nMeanwhile, juveniles continue to be sent to Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake. Local officials have few other options for serious offenders.\n\nFor judges in Milwaukee County Children's Court, who handle child welfare and juvenile delinquency cases, they face the quandary of sending youth to a place they view as dangerous.\n\n“Day in and day out, my colleagues are asked to remove children from homes, parental homes, that are being investigated for abuse and neglect,\" said Triggiano. \"In the same breath, we are being asked to send kids to a place being investigated for abuse and neglect.”\n\nVictim becomes suspect\n\nSoon after Evans' toes were crushed at Lincoln Hills, he attacked an inmate at a Wauwatosa detention center. He was convicted of battery in June.\n\nEvans, who turned 18 in September, has been acting out, sometimes violently, since middle school, court records show. He ran away from group homes, assaulted a teacher and stole a van before he was sent to Lincoln Hills on a theft charge. There, he often was in the segregation unit for fighting.\n\nBy this fall, his circumstances appeared to have improved. On Sept. 20, Evans signed the settlement that would provide him $300,000.\n\nThree days later, before he got the settlement money, Evans and two others snatched a woman's car keys from a table at a McDonald's in Milwaukee, ran into the parking lot and stole her Honda Odyssey, prosecutors allege.\n\nRecords show Evans is a suspect in four other carjacking and car theft cases from October. Prosecutors will decide soon whether to charge him, said Assistant District Attorney Benjamin Wesson.\n\nEvans is the first former inmate to get a settlement, but he may not be the last. The Walker administration has hired a law firm specifically to handle expected lawsuits against the state from former Lincoln Hills inmates and their families.\n\nJohn Diedrich of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nFacing problems, Missouri revamped juvenile justice\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nFor this investigation of Wisconsin's juvenile prisons, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel conducted dozens of interviews and reviewed more than 1,000 pages of documents gathered under the state's open records law.\n\nThose who were interviewed include the parents of juvenile inmates at Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls, current and former guards, corrections officials, prosecutors, public defenders, law enforcement officers and elected officials.\n\nAmong the records that were reviewed are prison incident reports; internal investigation reports; transcripts of internal investigators' interviews with staff and inmates; settlement agreements; sheriff department reports; inmate requests for compensation because of injuries; budget reports; court documents; correspondence from inmates; and emails and text messages sent by prison workers and other state officials.\n\nAll accounts in this article come from one of these sources and often a combination of sources. For instance, the account of an inmate having his foot smashed in November 2015 is drawn from interviews with those who were there that night or directly familiar with what happened, as well as incident reports, the boy's account as submitted in a notice of claim, and transcripts of interviews conducted by internal investigators.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel has not named Lincoln Hills juveniles who have been injured, except in the case of Kenyadi Evans, whose foot was smashed.

The letter does not detail what Burns may have done, but offers hints about what led to the termination.\n\nIn the letter, Diacon begins by pointing out Burns' “significant, repetitive and intentional” violations using his P card, a card university officials use to purchase supplies, travel and other work-related needs.\n\nDiacon does not say how Burns may have misused his card.\n\nThe single-page letter says Burns violated KSU policies, including conflict of interest and code of conduct, and also violated Ohio's ethics laws.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the university referred Burns to the Ohio Ethics Commission, which investigates potential legal violations of ethics law.\n\nKSU’s conflict of interest policy prohibits some university employees from entering into contracts that involve KSU employees, employees’ families or business associates, among other things, according to the school website.\n\nThe school's code of conduct policy requires employees to maintain a professional demeanor, respect the dignity and well-being of others and practice personal and professional integrity, among other things, KSU's website said.\n\nFinally, Diacon said in the letter that Burns also displayed “dishonesty in the performance” of his duties and that his actions put the university in a precarious public position.\n\nAlthough Diacon doesn’t specify what Burns did to risk KSU’s reputation, he said the policy Burns violated includes dishonesty, fraud or violence that may or may not involve police, among other things.\n\nBurns couldn’t immediately be reached for comment Monday.\n\nBurns did, however, express both his disappointment and appreciation for the opportunity at Kent State on the social media site X earlier this month:\n\n\"My family and I are saddened by the news today. We are thankful for the relationships and connections we have made with the players, coaches, and staff over the past few years,” Burns posted.\n\n“The team bond we have is not transactional but that of a family… I am proud of you all, and we will be rooting for you this season and beyond,” he wrote.\n\nBurns was put on administrative leave with pay March 27, before his termination.\n\nKSU at the time offered no explanation, leaving some to wonder if the action was linked to the Golden Flashes’ losing football program under his leadership.\n\nIn two seasons, Burns compiled a 1-23 record and is coming off a winless season (0-12) last year. The Golden Flashes have been winless in the Mid-American Conference in those two seasons, registering an 0-16 record and have not beaten a Division I FBS opponent. The only win came against Central Connecticut State (38-10 on Sept. 9, 2023), an FCS team.\n\nThe termination letter does not mention the football team, its win-loss record or anything on the field.\n\nBeacon Journal reporter George Thomas contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/02/kohls-ceo-fired-ashley-buchanan/83405989007/", "title": "Kohl's fires CEO over 'personal relationship': What we know", "text": "Kohl's fired its CEO, Ashley Buchanan, on April 30 after finding he made improper business deals with someone he had a personal relationship with, according to a filing the company made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe company said it terminated Buchanan, who was named the company's CEO in January, after conducting an investigation that found he directed the company to \"conduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Mr. Buchanan has a personal relationship,\" according to the SEC filing.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported the individual was a romantic partner of Buchanan's, identified as Chandra Holt.

She voted to approve divvying up a big chunk o' federal grant money to multiple good causes, including THAW, the nonprofit that ended up hiring her. THAW was a regular recipient of this federal grant money, which the city doles out on an annual basis after Uncle Sam forks it over.\n\nJenkins claims the city's ethics ordinance was meant to apply strictly to businesses, not nonprofits.\n\nStill, Jenkins said she consulted with city officials before taking the job with THAW and was told that was A-OK. My reporting confirms Jenkins' account.\n\nThe problem for Jenkins didn't come until after she announced she would resign from council to become CEO at THAW.\n\nTo her chagrin then — and now — Jenkins said city officials changed their mind and told her she would be violating the ethics ordinance by quitting to work for THAW less than a year after casting a vote that resulted in THAW getting tax dollars.\n\nIf you're confused, you're probably not alone.\n\nSo hang in there, because I'll explain how Jenkins got in this pickle; I'll share why she says the admonishment is not an indication she can't follow the rules, and I'll tell you who else has been admonished.\n\nFor those of you wondering: \"What the hell is this big word Elrick keeps throwing around — and does he even know what it means?!?\" I'll not only tell you what an admonishment is, I'll let you know whether it's a big deal.\n\nAn unexpected opportunity\n\nIn August 2014, eight months after Jenkins started serving her second term on the Detroit City Council, she got a call from a recruiter.\n\n\"The first couple calls, I wasn't interested,\" she told me last week. \"And then by the third call, I thought: 'This is probably something I should look at.' \"\n\nEven though voters had just reelected Jenkins to another four-year term, it was not a fun time to be in city hall.\n\nDetroit was on the verge of becoming the biggest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. Elected officials were poised to lose their power to an emergency manager. Scandalous scoundrel George Cushingberry Jr., a political hack renowned for his ability to navigate the halls of power, began plotting to overthrow Jenkins as city council president shortly after being sworn in for his first term on council ... which occurred shortly after he was stopped by the cops outside The Penthouse Club.\n\nMeanwhile, THAW was looking for a new CEO and offering a six-figure salary that would double Jenkins' council salary of about $80,000.\n\nJenkins told me the prospect of watching Cushingberry pull the strings on council and the opportunity for a big raise did not influence her decision to quit. She also said her personal financial struggles weren't a factor.\n\n\"My decision to go to The Heat and Warmth Fund was based on the mission of the organization and the ability I would have to serve vulnerable families like the one I came from,\" she said.\n\nJenkins said her first meeting with THAW was in September 2014.\n\nFour months earlier, on June 12, 2014, Jenkins had voted to approve the distribution of federal Community Development Block Grants that included $100,000 for THAW.\n\nConcerned that vote might cause a problem with the city's revolving door policy, Jenkins said she reached out to Portia Roberson, a city official whose duties included overseeing the Board of Ethics. Jenkins said she was told: \"No, there isn't an issue.\"\n\nRoberson confirmed to me last week that Jenkins asked whether taking the job with THAW would be a problem, and was told \"there was nothing preventing her from taking a job with THAW\" because of a vote she had taken.\n\n\"From that point on,\" Jenkins told me, \"anything that came from THAW, I recused myself from that.\"\n\nAn unexpected problem\n\nJenkins said THAW offered her the CEO job in late September or early October 2014.\n\nEthics records say that on Oct. 14, 2014, Jenkins abstained from voting on a contract awarding THAW more than $247,000.\n\nThen, a week before she left council, Jenkins said city officials called and asked to meet.\n\nShe said representatives from the city law department and board of ethics told her they determined she would be violating the revolving door policy after all.\n\nJenkins said she asked them \"What's the remedy?\" and was told: \"The only thing you can do is rescind your resignation.\"\n\nShe said they also told her that if she quit and took the job with THAW nothing would happen, \"unless somebody files a complaint.\"\n\nJenkins said that someone filed a complaint \"a year or so later.\"\n\nEthics board records say the complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2014.\n\nJenkins and her lawyer fought the charge.\n\n\"This was never meant for nonprofits,\" she told me. \"The intent of this language was to prohibit folks from going to work for contractors, not grantees.\"\n\nNevertheless, the board of ethics voted 2-1 on Aug. 20, 2015, to admonish Jenkins.\n\nWhile the conflicting advice city officials gave Jenkins created a dilemma, she still could have avoided a problem with the ethics board by staying on council.\n\nWhen I asked Jenkins whether her decision to leave for THAW anyway indicated she can't follow the rules, she replied: \"I followed the rules as I knew them when I learned about it. I sought advice. I was given advice. ... From that point on, I abstained from voting on anything related to THAW. And then I went to do this important work for our most vulnerable residents of the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan.\n\n\"I have always upheld a high standard of ethics. Throughout that process, I was open, I was transparent and worked to ensure that I was acting appropriately.\"\n\nBesides, Jenkins added, she believed the ethics rules were vague and her own experts told her it didn't apply to nonprofits.\n\nThe Board of Ethics has made at least three admonishments since the 2012 charter — which voters approved in the wake of the Kwame Kilpatrick text message scandal — took effect. For reasons that even board officials can't explain, only one of the admonishments appears on the board's website.\n\nOther than a hassle, and potential embarrassment, Jenkins faced no consequences and led THAW for a decade. Her salary rose from $188,000 in 2016 to more than $255,000 in 2024, her last year on the job before stepping down to run for mayor.\n\nA slap ... or a tickle?\n\nJenkins, Mayor Dave Bing and an obscure bureaucrat and hustler named Willie Donwell are the only city officials I could find who have been admonished by the Board of Ethics.\n\nBing was dinged in 2013 for hiring a law firm during the bankruptcy era to advise him without first obtaining approval from the city's law department. Board of Ethics records do not note any consequences.\n\nDonwell was disciplined in 2017 for serving as chairman of a board that reviewed property assessments while working for a real estate business and obstructing the board's investigation. He was ordered to undergo ethics training with the board of ethics within 90 days of his admonishment, which was shared with the mayor, city council, city clerk and the media.\n\nDonwell essentially received a slap on the wrist, while Bing and Jenkins didn't even receive a slap from a feather duster.\n\nChristal Phillips became executive director of the Board of Ethics after the Bing, Jenkins and Donwell cases were resolved. She said the board's remedies to ethical breaches include: referring a violation to the city council for consideration of forfeiture or removal from office; referring a violation to a supervisor with a recommendation that they consider taking disciplinary action; suspending or disqualifying a contractor or vendor from doing work for the city, and admonishments, which the board now publishes in the Detroit Legal News.\n\nThe latter amounts to publicly shaming someone, which, if they were willing to act unethically in the first place, doesn't seem like much of a price to pay for breaking the rules. And while the Detroit Legal News is a fine and important publication, it doesn't circulate very widely outside political and legal circles.\n\nPhillips acknowledged that the threat of an admonishment probably doesn't leave many folks quaking in their boots, but she quite rightly noted that there are situations where it can have a potentially significant impact.\n\n\"Even though a public admonishment may not be seen as particularly severe, for a public servant — particularly one who is running for public office — it could be severe, it could be damaging,\" she told me last week.\n\nI know Jenkins wishes she had not been admonished. And I'm pretty sure she wishes you didn't know about it — especially less than a month before voters narrow the mayoral field down to the top two finishers in the Aug. 5 primary.\n\nA lesson for all of us\n\nThere's something else about Jenkins' admonishment that may not be obvious that is, nonetheless, newsworthy: Jenkins was willing to discuss it.\n\nThis is, sadly, significant because the number of public officials and candidates for public office who hide behind statements and spokespeople far outnumbers the number willing to face tough questions.\n\nBecause public records are not always readily available or complete, it's crucial that officials explain themselves when it appears they may have done something wrong. Documents alone would not have spelled out Jenkins' journey from city councilwoman to nonprofit CEO.\n\nOnly Jenkins could do that.\n\nAnd she did.\n\nOf course, if Jenkins could have responded to a list of questions emailed in advance, she would have likely preferred that.\n\nI told her campaign what I tell everyone: I don't work that way.\n\nNeither should you.\n\nWhen you have a question for an official or a candidate, you should expect a spontaneous, genuine answer. If the official or candidate can't answer one of your questions, it's reasonable for them to ask for time to get back to you.\n\nIf we allow officials and candidates to demand questions in advance, which they can respond to whenever they see fit, how do we even know if they are the one answering? Their response, if it ever arrives, may have been drafted by a team of consultants or pollsters or lawyers looking for the best thing to say, rather than providing a genuine response.\n\nHolding office, especially a job as challenging as mayor of Detroit, requires a skill set that includes being knowledgeable and being able to react and respond to situations that can't always be scheduled in advance. The best leaders are quick on their feet, without being rash.\n\nWhich brings us to another issue worth considering as candidates ask for your time, your attention and your vote:\n\nIf they aren't willing to answer your questions when they want something from you — when they need something from you — what do you think the odds are they'll talk to you after they've got what they wanted?\n\nM.L.

At 2,200 square miles, the chunk of floating ice is nearly the size of Delaware.\n\nThe iceberg is likely to be named A68.\n\nOver the past several months, an ever-lengthening and widening crack in the ice shelf captivated the world. Now, the 120-mile crack first spotted in 2011 finally made its way back to the sea, \"calving\" off the massive berg.\n\n\"The iceberg is one of the largest recorded and its future progress is difficult to predict,\" said Adrian Luckman, a professor of Swansea University and the lead investigator of Project MIDAS. \"It may remain in one piece but is more likely to break into fragments. Some of the ice may remain in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters.\"\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nPreviously, he said the iceberg breaking off \"will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula.\" The calving reduced the size of the ice shelf by some 12%.\n\n“We have been anticipating this event for months, and have been surprised how long it took for the rift to break through the final few kilometers (miles) of ice,\" Luckman said. \"We will continue to monitor both the impact of this calving event on the Larsen C ice shelf, and the fate of this huge iceberg.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nNo penguins harmed in the making of the Antarctic iceberg\n\nIce shelf to iceberg: What does it mean?\n\nWhat happens now that the iceberg has broken off Antarctica ice shelf?\n\nAntarctica's expanding ice-free areas threaten animals and plants, study says\n\nUnfortunately, there are no public websites allowing a live view of the iceberg or ice shelf. The development of the rift over the past year was monitored using data from the European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellites, a radar-imaging system capable of acquiring images regardless of cloud cover, and throughout the current winter period of polar darkness.\n\n\"It's the Antarctic winter now, and lack of sunlight means that no optical satellite data is being collected,\" Luckman said in June.\n\nScientists obtain radar images from orbiting European satellites using microwave energy. But the images themselves reveal nothing, and it is only by special processing of the data that scientists can track the iceberg, Luckman said.\n\nAs for how long the iceberg will stick around, it depends on how quickly it moves to a warmer climate, and how quickly it breaks into smaller pieces.\n\nThe iceberg — or icebergs if it breaks up ever further — may remain in the region, where the ocean is quite cold, sticking around for years or even decades. Or it could move with ocean currents and winds in a northward direction, where it will be eroded more quickly.\n\nA similar event happened 15 years ago with the dramatic break-up of part of the nearby Larsen B ice shelf.\n\nIce shelves are permanent floating sheets of ice connected to a landmass, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Since the ice is already floating, the newly created iceberg won't contribute to rising sea levels.\n\nProject MIDAS said there is no evidence to directly link the calving of the iceberg to climate change. However, it is widely accepted that warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures have been a factor in earlier disintegrations of ice shelves elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula, most notably Larsen A in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002.\n\nGlobal warming has pushed temperatures up to 5 degrees higher in the region since the 1950s and could increase up to 7 degrees more by the end of the century, putting more stress on the ice, according to Climate Central.\n\nRegardless of whether climate change is a factor, calving is a natural part of the cycle of ice shelves. Ice flows gradually into the shelf, the shelf expands until stresses become too much, and then icebergs are formed.\n\nWhether or not Larsen C will reform is unclear.

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier (2021) 02:30 - Source: CNN See Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier (2021) 02:30\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred.

In Greenland, ice sheet decline continues to outpace accumulation, because warmer temperatures have led to increased melt and faster glacier movement at the island's edges, the data center said.\n\n\"Not long ago, we wondered about the effect on sea levels if Earth's major glaciers were to start retreating. We no longer need to wonder,\" Rignot said. \"For a couple of decades now, we've been able to directly observe the results of climate warming on polar glaciers.

Ice draining from the Thwaites into the Amundsen Sea already accounts for about 4% of global sea-level rise.\n\nBut during a meeting with the American Geophysical Union on Monday, scientists say the eastern ice shelf holding the glacier in place has cracks rapidly accelerating that could see it collapse within the next three to five years and spell the beginning of the end of the Thwaites glacier.\n\n\"I visualized it somewhat similar to a car window where you have a few cracks that are slowly propagating, and then suddenly you go over a bump in your car and the whole thing just starts to shatter in every direction,\" Erin Pettit, associate professor of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences at Oregon State University, said during the press conference. \"The collapse of this ice shelf will result in a direct increase in sea-level rise pretty rapidly.\"\n\nThe ice shelf itself wouldn't contribute to rise in global sea levels, but it's not the same for the glacier. The collapse would expose the Thwaites Glacier to ocean water, but the glacier is also suffering from cracks due to the warm water underneath.\n\nWhen the glacier becomes exposed, the international team of scientists fear the occurrence of ice cliff collapse, when chunks of the glacier exposed to ocean water breaks off into the water. If the glacier were to continue to collapse, it would pose a threat to numerous coastal cities across the world that are already becoming more dangerous to live in due to rising sea levels.\n\nMore: Greenland's ice sheet is melting so fast, it's raising sea levels and creating global flood risk\n\nRain: The Arctic will soon see more rain than snow.

And it could lead to even more sea-level rise, up to 10 feet, if it draws the surrounding glaciers with it.\"\n\nScambos said the glacier could survive on its own, but it will be important to \"get a clearer picture of how the glacier will behave\" within the next 100 years. But all signs point to the glacier not surviving long.\n\n\"The satellite imagery that we've been following, that it's going to essentially bypass that pinning point and start fracturing and falling apart,\" Pettit said. \"It's a little bit unsettling.\"\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/14/antarctica-iceberg-a23s-spins-watch/72595376007/", "title": "The world's largest iceberg, A23a, is in its 'spinning era' as it moves ...", "text": "The world's biggest iceberg is on the move – and it's got the moves.\n\nThe nearly 1,000-ton iceberg, known as A23a, located near Antarctica has done a twirl and spun in a circle. It's not totally unusual for icebergs to spin, as two smaller but still massive icebergs had done so similarly on their path north, the British Antarctic Survey said Wednesday.\n\nBut A23a – it's four times the size of New York City, according to Earth.com – began to rotate a bit sooner than other bergs. The iceberg began moving in December, breaking free from the floor of the Weddell Sea near northwestern Antarctica. It had broken off the continent's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986, but got stuck on the ocean floor for many years.\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey scientists described A23a's maneuvers as part of its \"spinning era … These dance moves down ‘iceberg alley’ are part of the iceberg’s long, melty journey into warmer waters,\" the team wrote on Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nWhat do we know about the A23a iceberg?\n\nThe iceberg is more than twice the size of Greater London, measuring about 1,500 square miles (about 4,000 square kilometers). It had been apparently drifting for the past year and began picking up speed in late 2023, Andrew Fleming, a remote sensing expert from the British Antarctic Survey, told the BBC in November.\n\n“I asked a couple of colleagues about this, wondering if there was any possible change in shelf water temperatures that might have provoked it, but the consensus is the time had just come,” Fleming told the BBC.\n\nThe iceberg is currently doing its spin \"in a stretch of water between Elephant Island and the South Orkney Islands – small parcels of land at the tip\" of the Antarctic Peninsula, the BBC reported.\n\nOcean and wind currents moved it into the Southern Ocean, and it is expected to continue to move northeast at about 30 miles per hour into “iceberg alley,” toward the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.\n\nAssessing A23a using imagery from NASA satellites using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), the British Antarctic Survey posted that \"there’s not been any major changes to the shape of the berg (though a few smaller fragments are running ahead to the North East).\"\n\nA British research team on the RRS Sir David Attenborough caught up with the iceberg on the way to Antarctica in December 2023. They collected seawater samples around the iceberg’s route to help determine what life could form around it and how the iceberg and others like it impact carbon in the ocean, Laura Taylor, a scientist working on the ship, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"We know that these giant icebergs can provide nutrients to the waters they pass through, creating thriving ecosystems in otherwise less productive areas. What we don’t know is what difference particular icebergs, their scale, and their origins can make to that process,” she said.\n\nSuch research offers not only information about icebergs but also broader global climate implications, Earth.com reported. \"The story of A23a is intrinsically linked to the narrative of global warming. The increasing rate of iceberg calving in Antarctica raises concerns about the stability of ice shelves and the potential for accelerated sea-level rise,\" wrote the site's founder Eric Ralls.\n\nRsearchers: Mega iceberg shows signs of erosion\n\nLast month, EYOS Expeditions arrived at iceberg A23a and used a drone to capture video and found significant erosion and transformation, expedition leader Ian Strachan told Earth.com. \"We saw waves, a good three meters or four meters high, smashing into the berg… These were creating cascades of ice – a constant state of erosion,\" he said.\n\nThe drone footage and images showed how the iceberg was being reshaped with caves and arches, by waves hitting it. Eventually, the top layers will collapse.\n\nMore icebergs\n\nPrevious record-holding icebergs include A68, which measured about 2,240 square miles and broke off northwest Antarctica in July 2017, according to Earth.com. And A76, which measured 1,670 square miles and broke off the Weddell Sea ice shelf in May 2021, but subsequently broke into three pieces, the site said.\n\nThe largest iceberg ever recorded with satellite imagery is B15, which broke from southern Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000, and was 25 miles long and covered 4,250 square miles, according to Guinness World Records.\n\nAs for A23a, the iceberg \"stands as a stark reminder of the Earth’s changing climate and the urgent need to understand and protect our planet’s polar regions,\" Ralls wrote. \"In summary, the story of A23a is not just about a massive chunk of ice. The takeaway here is the interconnectedness of our global environment and the shared responsibility we hold in safeguarding it for future generations.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

It is also covered in ice sheets that are 4 kilometers thick on the eastern side of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains and 2 kilometers thick on the west. So how does ice accumulate so thickly in such a snow-starved land?\n\nRebecca Totten, an associate professor at the University of Alabama, is studying the Thwaites Glacier and the seafloor around Antarctica to find out why the glacier, dubbed the \"Doomsday Glacier,\" is melting so rapidly in a land that seldom sees a temperature above freezing.\n\n\"Glaciers are like bank accounts. You have inputs and outputs. The inputs would be snow, the output is melting, ablation. In Antarctica, it is mostly breaking off of icebergs because it is so cold there (not much surface melting occurs.) If you have more inputs than outputs, that means you start to keep the ice year round and you grow a glacier that will expand with time. For a glacier to grow, it has to stay cold enough for the ice to remain year-round,\" Totten said.\n\nOne of the courses she teaches at Alabama is on how glaciers form.\n\nGlobally, there have been numerous ice ages and times when the ice sheets have melted and sea level rose, then the ice grew again. Both ice cores and ocean deep cores reveal that the ice sheets fluctuated in this way every 100,000 years.\n\n\"If you look back over a million years, you can see these regular cycles at about 100,000 year intervals. Ice grows and then ice melts back and forth. We are in part of this natural cycle here in which 20,000 years ago we had a maximum of ice and a sea level 120 meters lower than it is today and glaciers have been melting and receding since,\" Totten said.\n\nThis life cycle of the earth is reliably recorded in the ice layers. There are bubbles trapped in the ice layers that contain air from those past times. These bubbles allow scientists to analyze the atmosphere from bygone eras. In those bubbles is written a detailed climatological record.\n\n\"If you continue to look at those ice core records and you look at the amount of carbon dioxide in the bubbles in the ice, the thing that’s unique about right now is that associated with these cycles, we know how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere. That variation was always between at the maximum 280 and the minimum 180 parts per million. We can see this exactly from a million years of ice. But, if we look today, we are at 420 ppm (parts per million),\" Totten said.\n\nThe earth is in a period of natural recession of ice all over the world. The additional carbon in the atmosphere combined with a warming of the world's oceans is producing an acceleration to the natural process. In the natural order, earth would again enter a cooling phase, but the impact of additional carbon and warmer oceans remains to be seen.\n\n\"The general consensus is we are conducting the largest scale man-made experiment ever. I can’t take credit for that. (Geologist) Richard Alley was the one to say it. He is a famous ice core guy,\" Totten said.\n\n\"We are seeing a lot of change right now. For Thwaites Glacier specifically, that is so rapidly changing and if it continues to change, accelerate and thin, and contribute ice to the ocean and raise sea level, that could spell doom for these coastal areas like where I grew up or Mobile, the area that I study as the other arm of my research,\" she said.\n\nReach Gary Cosby Jr. at gary.cosby@tuscaloosanews.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/13/iceberg-breaks-off-from-antarctica-reveals-flourishing-life/82792462007/", "title": "Iceberg breaks off from Antarctica, reveals flourishing life", "text": "When an iceberg the size of Chicago broke off from one of Antarctica's massive floating glaciers in January, a team of scientists working nearby quickly pivoted, steering their ship to explore the newly revealed seafloor.\n\nWhat they found surprised and amazed them.\n\n“We didn’t expect to find such a beautiful, thriving ecosystem. Based on the size of the animals, the communities we observed have been there for decades, maybe even hundreds of years,\" said Patricia Esquete of the Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies and the Department of Biology at the University of Aveiro, Portugal.\n\nShe was part of an international team of scientists from the Schmidt Ocean Institute working in the Bellingshausen Sea. When they got word that a new iceberg, named A-84, had broken off, they shifted their work to see what was revealed on a seabed that had been covered by almost 500 feet of ice for centuries.\n\nLess than two weeks later, they were in place and began using autonomous underwater vehicles called gliders to quickly inventory what proved to be a thriving ecosystem that had lived for hundreds of years with no light and few nutrients.\n\n“We seized upon the moment, changed our expedition plan, and went for it so we could look at what was happening in the depths below,” Esquete said.\n\nDouglas McCauley, a professor of ocean science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was impressed the research team was flexible enough to divert course to take those observations.\n\n\"Some of the best discoveries come when disciplined scientists that have spent years planning every minute of a cruise years in advance are brave enough to go: 'OMG a gigantic iceberg just calved off – let go see what was under that!'\" he said.\n\nIt proved to be a fortuitous diversion of their ship, R/V Falkor (Too). In water as much as 4,200 feet deep the team from the Schmidt Ocean Institute found a surprisingly flourishing ecosystem that included icefish, giant sea spiders, octopus, corals and sponges.\n\nThey suspect they've found several new species, but determining that will take time.\n\nSuch opportunities to see what lives in these areas are rare, said Andrew Thurber, a professor of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at UC Santa Barbara who specializes in Antarctic research.\n\nWith the advent of remote submersible robots it shouldn't be hard to work under significant ice, he said, but it remains a serious technological challenge for marine science.\n\nIt's not just \"Send a robot under the ice and it comes back with cool data,\" he said. \"In reality, they often have issues and with hundreds of meters of ice over their head – the odds of getting home become bleak.\"\n\nWhat are these sea creatures eating under the ice?\n\nOne of the mysteries of the discovery is what these sea creatures have been eating. Close to a mile down, with a 500-foot layer of ice between them and the sun for centuries, there's not a lot of choice when it comes to dinner.\n\n\"These communities are very far removed from the sun and this source of energy,\" Thurber said.\n\nIn the deepest depths of the ocean, sea inhabitants rely on a constant rain of nutrients that slowly sinks down from the surface.\n\nCalled \"marine snow,\" it's composed of dead animals, plants, feces and other organic materials. The name comes from the fact that it looks like \"little white fluffy bits\" slowly falling through the water column, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nBut the newly uncovered area has been covered by ice for centuries, cut off from surface nutrients. The discovery of so much life – and such big life – was unanticipated, Thurber said.\n\n\"We would expect there to be an animal community that is more like what is in the deep-deep sea, which is smaller animals and incredible diversity but not large animals except in unique cases,\" he said.\n\nInstead there were large invertebrates. \"That is why this is such a surprising discovery,\" he said.\n\nThe scientists hypothesize that ocean currents are moving nutrients around and that the currents are possibly the mechanism that sustains life beneath the ice sheet, though how that works precisely isn't yet known.\n\nWhere did this iceberg come from?\n\nThe iceberg, named A-84, broke away from the George VI Ice Shelf, one of the massive floating glaciers attached to the Antarctic Peninsula. Ice shelves are permanent floating sheets of ice that connect to a landmass, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Such ice shelves are an important part of the earth's cryosphere.\n\nThe breaking off of this huge iceberg is an example of the ongoing shrinkage happening at the earth's poles over the past few decades as part of climate change.\n\nThis raises a question of what to do with the newly opened areas.\n\n\"Open seafloor can either be an area to expand industry but also opens up pristine habitats with unknown biodiversity, potential for drug discovery, and often long lived species that are susceptible to human activities,\" Thurber said.\n\nShould the areas be turned into marine conservation areas or exploited, most likely for fishing?\n\n\"I think that is something that we, as a global collaborative community charged with management of the Antarctic, are faced with in light of our rapidly changing globe,\" he said.\n\nCan these mysterious creatures survive in open ocean?\n\nOne of the biggest questions for the scientists is whether the sea creatures that had been happily living in an ecosystem covered by ice will fare now that the ice is gone.\n\n\"Some of them can move. Some of them, though, are embedded in that seabed. So they're anchored in place and they of course, will not be able to move,\" said Jyotika Virmani, executive director of Schmidt Ocean Institute.\n\n\"Until we go back or until scientists go back in a few months or a year, it's really difficult to say how this ecosystem is going to evolve,\" she said. \"But the the fact that we have this baseline information is phenomenal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2017/02/02/antarctica-ice-shelf-q-and-a/97406348/", "title": "What happens now that the iceberg has broken off Antarctica ice ...", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA giant iceberg nearly the size of Delaware has broken off an Antarctic ice shelf.\n\nScientists have closely watched the growing crack in the ice shelf over the past few months.\n\nSwansea University professor Adrian Luckman, a scientist with Project MIDAS, answered many of the burning questions about the newly created iceberg.\n\nHow is the iceberg tracked?\n\nIt is being tracked by many types of satellite data. As for actual photos taken by scientists aboard a survey plane, that won't occur until October, when the Antarctic spring is underway.\n\nIce shelf to iceberg: What does it mean?\n\nWill the iceberg's formation raise sea levels?\n\nNo, but it could indirectly cause a tiny sea-level rise years, decades, or even centuries from now — or never.\n\nThe ice shelf is already floating, so when a part of it detaches — such as the iceberg — no extra water is displaced. Project MIDAS research shows the remaining ice shelf may be less stable and could follow the example of its northerly neighbor Larsen B, which experienced an acceleration of glaciers upon its ice shelf break-up. Other scientists expect the ice shelf to regrow. Only time will tell.\n\nEven if it is less stable, the point at which collapse of the remaining ice shelf would occur would be many years away. Only following this potential far-away collapse would sea-level rise occur, and even then the extra rates of sea-level rise would be small, measured in millimeters per year at most.\n\nSize matters: 10 landmarks smaller than the Antarctic iceberg\n\nAre any penguins at risk?\n\nNo. There are no penguin colonies on the ice shelf.\n\nHow long will it take for the iceberg to completely melt after it breaks off?\n\nIt depends on how quickly the iceberg moves to a warmer climate, and how quickly it breaks into smaller pieces. The iceberg — or icebergs if it breaks up ever further — may remain in the region, where the ocean is quite cold, and stick around for years, even decades. Or it could move with ocean currents and winds in a northward direction, where it will be eroded more quickly. So far, there is only the one large berg and no smaller ones.\n\nWas a wave created when the iceberg broke off?\n\nNo. The breaking off, or \"calving\" as it is called, was slow and graceful. The ice is already floating so when the fracture broke all the way through, it simply started to drift away.\n\nIs there any way to watch the iceberg live?\n\nNo. Accessing that area is logistically difficult and involves preparing well in advance. And even if a camera were set up, it could only see a small part of the iceberg, while satellites see the whole thing on a regular basis.\n\nWill another iceberg form behind this one?\n\nIt depends on how the remaining ice reacts to the change, but we are unlikely to see anything as big as this from this ice shelf for a long, long time.\n\nCan the ice shelf reform?\n\nYes. Calving is a natural part of the cycle of ice shelves. Ice flows gradually into the shelf, the shelf expands until stresses become too much, and then icebergs are formed. Whether or not Larsen C will reform is unclear. Scientists think there is a possibility the remaining shelf is too fragile to grow back to its former size.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/31/scott-pruitt-epa-environment-editorials-debates/96949070/", "title": "Protect the environment, reject Pruitt: Our view", "text": "The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMuch of the debate over human-caused climate change has been focused on whether the threat has been overestimated. But what if the threat has been underestimated?\n\nScientists are constantly being surprised by how quickly the planet is changing. Last year was the warmest since modern record-keeping began. Rising temperatures contributed to killer heat waves in Asia and the Middle East, a supersize wildfire in Canada, the retreat of glaciers across the globe and the vast bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.\n\nClimatologists say the Arctic could be ice-free in summer within a decade or two. The world's largest iceberg — the size of Delaware — is preparing to break off from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Scientists now believe that, under the worst scenario, oceans could rise more than 8 feet by century's end, inundating coastal cities.\n\nIn a bid to stave off catastrophe, nearly 200 nations last year joined the Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the Obama administration mandated cleaner power plants and more fuel-efficient cars.\n\nMuch of this progress could be reversed under President Trump, who has expressed skepticism about climate change, has threatened to pull the United States out of the Paris accords, and could jettison Obama's regulations on power plant emissions and gas mileage standards.\n\nSen. Barrasso: EPA needs Scott Pruitt\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, and Trump could not have nominated someone more opposed to the agency's mission than Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be its new administrator. Pruitt, a champion of the fossil fuel industry, has sued the EPA 14 times to block environmental regulations. In 13 cases, co-plaintiffs included industries that contributed money to Pruitt's political campaign or affiliated committees. During recent confirmation testimony, the nominee declined to say whether, as EPA administrator, he would voluntarily recuse himself from dealing with the lawsuits he filed against the agency.\n\nPruitt offered a very carefully worded response about climate change. He conceded it was happening. But as to whether the burning of fossil fuels was a primary cause? Debatable, he said. Actually, climate scientists attribute 80% to 90% of recent warming to human causes. Pressed about what specifically was causing climate change, Pruitt refused to answer: \"My personal opinion is immaterial.\" Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nElections have consequences and, in most cases, if a nominee is qualified, a new president should be allowed his or her choice. No one should be under the delusion that if Pruitt is turned down, Trump will pick Al Gore to be his EPA administrator. But when the future of the planet is on the line, the choice of someone so openly hostile to the EPA's mission is unacceptable. The Senate should send that message to the White House and reject the Pruitt nomination.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Many of its property projects have been delayed since last year because of the company’s liquidity issues.\n\nAnalysts have long been concerned that a collapse of Evergrande could trigger wider risks for China’s property market, hurting homeowners and the broader financial system. Real estate and related industries account for as much as 30% of GDP.\n\nSince Evergrande’s default, several other major developers, including Kaisa, Fantasia, and Shanghai-based Shimao Group, have also sought protection from creditors.\n\nIn recent weeks, the real estate crisis has escalated further. Thousands of angry homebuyers who had previously paid down payments for unfinished projects threatened to stop paying mortgages if construction is not completed in time. Some of them have staged protests in central Wuhan city, pressuring local government and banks to help push developers deliver their prepaid homes.\n\n“The mortgage boycotts are a double threat to developers and to the housing market,” said analysts at Capital Economics in a report late last month.\n\nThey have drawn attention to the problem of cash-strapped developers being unable to complete properties that they have already sold, which is “putting off new homebuyers.” The boycotts have also made banks more cautious about issuing mortgages, which could dent property sales further, they added.\n\nIn a report last week, S&P Global Ratings estimated China’s property sales could drop by a third this year because of mortgage strikes, as people believe developers won’t be able to complete presold units in time— the most common way they sell homes in the country.\n\n“Without sales, many more developers will collapse, which is both a financial and an economic threat,” said Capital Economics analysts.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/business/beyond-meat-executive-arrested-nose-bite-nightcap", "title": "Beyond Meat suspends executive after he was arrested on ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBeyond Meat suspended its chief operating officer after he was arrested over the weekend on suspicion of biting a man’s nose during a fight following an Arkansas football game.\n\nPolice arrested the vegan food purveyor’s COO Doug Ramsey on charges of “terroristic threatening” and third-degree battery on Saturday night.

The new version looks much, much sleeker than the chunky little SUV it replaces and adds new features. But it also drops one major option while retaining what may be the SUV’s most important feature, it’s cheap price.\n\nThe subcompact Trax SUV has a starting price of just $21,500, a couple of hundred dollars below it’s current price putting it firmly among the cheapest SUVs on the market. It will compete against the likes of the recently redesigned Honda HR-V, the Hyundai Kona, the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and the Nissan Kicks. All versions of the Trax, including flashy-looking Trax RS models, will have starting prices under $25,000, GM executives said. The average base sticker price for vehicles sold in the United States today is almost $47,000, according to Edmunds.com, so SUVs like the Trax are, relatively speaking, dirt cheap.\n\nThe fact that some automakers are adding more cheap SUVs to the lineups, while others have dropped out of this market altogether shows that there is opportunity here, said Brad Franz, director of Chevrolet cars and crossover SUVs.\n\nThere has been an overall increase in cheap SUV models – meaning those with base prices around $25,000 or less – in the last five years, according to Edmunds.com.\n\n“I’d also say that the quality of vehicles in this segment has improved dramatically,” said Edmunds.com editor Will Kaufman. “Automakers are taking it seriously.”\n\nThe US auto market has shifted heavily towards SUVs in recent years but, in general, SUVs tend to cost more than cars. Products like the Trax provide an opportunity for those who want the storage space and tall seating position of an SUV but can’t afford – or don’t want to pay for – bigger, more expensive models. Among cars that are not SUVs, Chevrolet currently has the cheapest one of those available in the United States, the $13,600 Spark. Some other automakers like Honda have abandoned the super-cheap car market believing those customers would just as well buy a good used car.\n\nThe Chevrolet Trax RS has a sportier appeance but no added performance. General Motors\n\nThe gas-powered Trax’s unveiling comes just weeks after GM unveiled the Chevrolet Equinox EV, a $30,000 electric SUV that will be among the cheapest electric SUVs on the market. These new SUVs serve as proof, company executives say, that GM’s mainstream Chevrolet brand intends to maintain a position at the cost-conscious bottom end of the car market, even as it also offers models like the $106,000 Corvette Z06 and Tahoe SUV models with base prices approaching $80,000.\n\nThe new Trax will be powered by a 1.2-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder engine producing about 137 horsepower, and it will be attached to a 6-speed automatic transmission. Unlike some competitors, the Trax will not be offered in an all-wheel-drive version, an option that is available on the current model. The new Trax will be available with front-wheel-drive only. Customers who want all-wheel-drive can choose the slightly more expensive Chevrolet Trailblazer, which has a more upright, truck-like appearance and a firmer ride for those wanting a more traditional SUV experience, Franz said.\n\nGM’s strategy of having two SUVs in this value-priced segment is similar to the approach taken by some others like Hyundai. The Venue, Hyundai’s cheapest SUV, is front-wheel-drive only but the slightly more expensive Kona offers all-wheel-drive as an option.\n\nThe Trax and Trailblazer share much of their engineering, including the little 3-cylinder engine, and both will be assembled at the same GM factory in South Korea. The Trax is slightly longer and lower. It’s also 11 inches longer and about two inches wider than the current Trax model. Besides the base-level Trax LT, it will also be available in RS versions with sportier design features, including special wheels and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. Trax Activ models will have a slightly more rugged off-road look including black wheels. Besides the design details and other added features, like heated front seats, there will be no real performance difference in these compared to other Trax SUVs.\n\nGM also boasts that the Trax will have options like active cruise control, which can automatically maintain a safe distance behind cars ahead on highways, a feature usually found on pricier vehicles. Active noise cancellation will also be a standard feature on all Trax models. This feature uses inaudible sound waves produced by the car’s stereo speakers to cancel out some noises such as those from the tires and engine.\n\nThe Trax will go on sale in the spring.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/business/cathay-pacific-hong-kong-covid-intl-hnk", "title": "Cathay will fly only 2% of normal passenger capacity as Hong Kong ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nCathay Pacific plans to continue operating at just minuscule levels as its home city remains largely cut off from the rest of the world.\n\nHong Kong’s flagship airline said Wednesday that it would likely only be able to maintain 2% of passenger flight capacity, and less than one third of its cargo flight load, compared to pre-pandemic levels due to rigorous government restrictions.\n\n“We have had an extremely challenging start to 2022,” Chairman Patrick Healy said in the company’s earnings presentation.\n\nHe noted that Hong Kong recently tightened quarantine measures for aircrew and placed temporary flight bans on some of Cathay’s top markets, including the United States and United Kingdom, over the emergence of the Omicron variant.\n\nThat came after the carrier only flew about 2,000 passengers on average in 2021, down from 100,000 during pre-pandemic times.\n\nThe plunge in part led to a loss of 776 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $99 million) last year, which compares with a much bigger loss of 12.2 billion Hong Kong dollars ($1.6 billion) the previous year. The airline has called 2020 “the most challenging year” in its history.\n\nOnce a premier aviation hub that was home to one of the busiest airports on the planet, Hong Kong has suffered a huge drop in commercial flight traffic during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, the city’s international airport handled a total of 8.8 million passengers and 160,655 flights, down by 87.7% and 61.7% year-on-year, respectively.\n\nLast year, that fell even further, to 1.4 million passengers and 144,815 flights, declines of 84.7% and 9.9% compared to the previous year, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong’s quarantine rules, which are among the world’s strictest, have taken a toll on aircrew based in the city. In recent months, this has led to a spike in resignations, burnout and plummeting morale at Cathay Pacific (CPCAY).\n\nThe carrier’s crew “spent more than 62,000 nights in quarantine hotels” in 2021, while an additional 11,000 nights were served in Penny’s Bay, a local government quarantine facility, according to Healy.\n\nDespite the trying circumstances, “we are resolutely committed to keeping the flow of people and cargo between Hong Kong and the rest of the world safely moving, and to protecting and enhancing the city’s aviation hub status,” he added.\n\n“We have absolute confidence in the long-term future of Hong Kong.”\n\nCathay also pointed to an “encouraging” couple of months for its cargo business, which saw revenue jump more than 30% compared to the previous year.\n\nThe company’s shares were up more than 4% in Hong Kong on Monday afternoon.\n\n— Lizzy Yee contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/business/starbucks-closures", "title": "Starbucks CEO on store closings: 'There are going to be many more ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nStarbucks may not be done closing stores over safety concerns.\n\n“We are beginning to close stores,” because of safety issues, interim CEO Howard Schultz said in a video posted to Twitter last week. “This is just the beginning. There are going to be many more.”\n\nStarbucks said last week that it is closing 16 stores over safety concerns. Around that time, Debbie Stroud and Denise Nelson, both senior vice presidents of US operations at the company, outlined the efforts that Starbucks is taking to make stores safer in an open letter.\n\nWorkers are “seeing firsthand the challenges facing our communities — personal safety, racism, lack of access to healthcare, a growing mental health crisis, rising drug use, and more,” they wrote, adding that “with stores in thousands of communities across the country, we know these challenges can, at times, play out within our stores too.”\n\nThe effort to make workers feel safer could result in more closings, according to Schultz’s video, which was first reported by Insider.\n\nStarbucks is closing some stores over safety concerns. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe company is offering active shooter training and other types of training, along with mental health benefits, access to abortion care, clarity around shifts and store policies, and more, the letter stated.\n\nIn cases where it isn’t able to create a safe environment in a store, Starbucks will close it permanently, the letter continued. In those instances, the company will move employees to neighboring stores.\n\n“One of the primary concerns that our retail partners have is their own personal safety,” Schultz said in the video, which was taken during a meeting last week discussing these efforts, according to a spokesperson.\n\nThe company also may close restrooms to the public, overturning a 2018 policy.\n\nThe focus on safety is part of Schultz’s broader efforts to revamp the company as it tries to fend off a growing unionization drive.\n\n“We need to reinvent Starbucks for the future,” he wrote in an open letter last week, noting that the company must “radically” improve employee experiences. He added that based on feedback from employees, the company will strive to create “safety, welcoming and kindness for our stores.”\n\nSchultz, who stepped into the CEO role for the third time in April, has been trying to stave off growing unionization efforts. As of June 24, over 130 stores with more than 3,400 employees have had their unions certified by the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB. The board has certified decisions against unionization at 15 locations through that date. And dozens of other stores are holding elections.\n\nUnion organizers have in the past pointed to store closures as a way to intimidate workers.\n\nin June, Starbucks (SBUX) workers at an Ithaca, New York, store claimed their location was being shut down in retaliation for their union activism. The worker committee said at the time that it was filing an Unfair Labor Practice charge with the NLRB, alleging that Starbucks (SBUX) was making a “clear attempt to scare workers across the country.”\n\nRegarding that store closure, a company spokesperson said at the time that Starbucks opens and closes stores as part of its regular operations, without offering specific reasons.\n\n“Our local, regional and national leaders have been working with humility, deep care and urgency to create the kind of store environment that partners and customers expect of Starbucks,” the Starbucks spokesperson said in June. “Our goal is to ensure that every partner is supported in their individual situation and we have immediate opportunities available in the market.”\n\nDuring its most recent fiscal year, Starbucks closed 424 US company-operated stores, or about 5% of its total, while opening 449 new locations.

And with prices surging amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, the record high of $4.11 per gallon set that year is likely to fall any day.\n\nThe AAA national average stands at $4.01, up 9 cents a gallon since Saturday’s reading, and up 47 cents, or 13%, since before Russia invaded Ukraine 11 days ago.\n\nThe daily weekend increases are larger than any one-day jump in price since Hurricane Katrina slammed the US Gulf Coast and damaged much of the nation’s oil and gas producing regions in 2005, sending prices soaring.\n\nThere are still some portions of the country where $4 a gallon gas is still rare. The large swath of central states, from North Dakota south to Texas, have averages no higher than $3.71 a gallon.\n\nBut prices are rapidly increasing everywhere. The lowest statewide average is in Missouri, where unleaded stands at $3.60 a gallon. But that’s up 28 cents, or 8%, in just the last week.\n\nThere are now 18 states, plus Washington DC, where the price is $4 or greater. All of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as the West Coast, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois, Alaska and Hawaii have statewide averages at or above $4. And three additional states, Florida, Michigan and Indiana, are less than half-a-cent away from the $4 mark.\n\nThe highest prices are being seen in California, where the statewide average stands at $5.29 a gallon.\n\n“This is not the end of it,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, which provides data to AAA from 130,000 stations nationwide. Wholesale gasoline prices rose 23 cents in trading Friday, an increase Kloza said would be passed onto consumers in short order.\n\n“It’s absolutely out of control,” he said.\n\nPrices have been rising because Russia is one of the world’s major oil exporters, with most of its output going to Europe and Asia. Russian oil made up only 2% of US imports in December, according to Energy Department data.\n\nBut oil is priced on global commodity markets, so the impact on global markets is felt everywhere.\n\nThe sanctions placed on Russia’s economy following the invasion have so far exempted oil exports. But traders have been reluctant to purchase Russian oil due to uncertainty about closing transactions given the limits on the the country’s banking sector, as well as concerns about finding oil tankers willing to dock in Russian ports.\n\nThere have been calls for the United States to ban the import of Russian oil. But that probably would have limited impact on global or domestic prices since so little is being shipped to US markets, Kloza said.\n\n“It’s not mission-critical. Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia – those are the big boys” in terms of US oil imports, Kloza said. “Russia is a bit player.”\n\nEven without a ban on US imports, Kloza expects the average price could rise to a new record of between $4.25 and $4.50 a gallon. Such a rapid price spike is making a particularly strong impression on consumers, he added.\n\n“When you get increases this quick, and this dramatic, you really scald the public,” Kloza said.\n\nThe average price one year ago was $2.76 a gallon, as the market was still recovering from the plunge that occurred early in the pandemic and stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns slashed demand for gasoline.\n\nThe average US household uses about 90 gallons of gas a month, Kloza said, so a $1.25 increase costs consumers roughly $105 a month, or nearly $1,300 over the course of a year.\n\n– CNN’s Matt Egan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/business/sam-bankman-fried-arrested", "title": "Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, is arrested in the Bahamas ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas on Monday after US prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, according to a statement from the government of the Bahamas.\n\nThe Southern District of New York, which is investigating Bankman-Fried and the collapse of FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda, confirmed his arrest on Twitter.\n\n“Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the US government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,” wrote US attorney Damian Williams. “We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.”\n\nBankman-Fried, was arrested without incident at his apartment complex shortly after 6 pm ET Monday in Nassau, and is set to appear in court Tuesday, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a statement.\n\nA representative for Bankman-Fried’s legal team didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nShortly after the SDNY confirmed his arrest, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had authorized separate charges relating to Bankman-Fried’s “violations of securities laws,” which will be filed publicly on Tuesday.\n\nIt’s unclear what charges await Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old crypto celebrity who became a pariah overnight last month as his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy, leaving at least a million depositors unable to access their funds.\n\nThe New York Times, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the charges against Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.\n\nThe United States’ extradition treaty with the Bahamas allows US prosecutors to return defendants to American soil if the charges would be considered punishable by imprisonment of at least a year in both jurisdictions.\n\nIn the four weeks since FTX filed for bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried has sought to cast himself as a somewhat hapless chief executive who got out over his skis, denying accusations that he defrauded FTX’s customers.\n\n“I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC over the weekend. “I didn’t want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.”\n\nBankman-Fried was scheduled Tuesday to appear virtually before the US House Financial Services Committee, which is demanding answers about how the company came crashing down, ricocheting throughout the digital asset ecosystem. Several crypto companies have halted operations, freezing customer accounts and in some cases filing for bankruptcy themselves because of their exposure to FTX.\n\nAfter his arrest, Rep. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the committee, said Bankman-Fried would no longer give testimony as scheduled Tuesday. The hearing was set to move ahead, however, beginning with testimony from FTX’s new CEO, John J.

The report said Bankman-Fried used this “backdoor” to transfer $10 billion in FTX customer funds to Alameda, the hedge fund, and at least $1 billion is now missing.\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowledge of any such backdoor. “I don’t even know how to code,” he told cryptocurrency vlogger Tiffany Fong in an interview last month.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/01/what-to-stock-up-on-port-strike/75466382007/", "title": "Which products could be affected by port strike?

Moreover, because the fruit is perishable, it's not economical for them to be shipped on planes, Miller wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nWill holiday shopping be affected?\n\nAmericans may also soon struggle to complete their holiday shopping.\n\nBecause of the strike's impending supply chain disruption, consumers may have a tough time finding the toys and other gifts for their children they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nSpend your money smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter for exclusive financial analysis.\n\nWhile large corporations like Walmart and Costco can afford to take inventories early and store them – or absorb the cost of rerouting shipments to the West Coast – smaller businesses typically can’t, experts have said.\n\nAs a result, “some businesses could miss out on critical holiday supplies entirely,” Ben Johnston, chief operating officer at small business lender Kapitus, told USA TODAY. “A strike of this nature could be the difference between turning a profit or stomaching a loss for the year.”\n\nIf holiday shopping disruptions are to be avoided, the clock is ticking.\n\n“Any strike that lasts more than one week could cause goods shortages for the holidays,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nHow else could the strike hit farmers, small businesses, jobs?\n\nThe Biden administration has declined to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows the federal government to force ports to reopen by seeking a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations. Instead, White House officials encouraged ongoing discussions amid pleas for help from retail, agriculture, commerce, auto care, toy and other groups.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses that sell products to international markets stand to take a major hit, experts said. For example, agricultural exporters of soybeans and poultry won’t be able to send their goods overseas and are poised to lose money because their goods are perishable.\n\nOn the employment front, companies facing parts shortages may resort to keeping lean inventories and, to keep costs low, might have to shut down assembly lines amid a prolonged strike, experts told USA TODAY.

But the protest came as the Covid situation in Switzerland “worsened”, with “6,200 new cases, 15 deaths and 64 people hospitalised” on Friday.\n\nThousands gathered in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Al Jazeera reported, “carrying flags, nationalist and religious symbols, along with banners against vaccination and what they describe as restrictions of people’s freedoms”.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin was also forced to “condemn violent protests in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, one of France’s overseas territories”, the broadcaster added.\n\nDemonstrators had “blocked roads and set fire to cars, protesting against France’s Covid-19 health pass required for restaurants and cafés, cultural venues, sport arenas and long-distance travel, as well as mandatory vaccinations for healthcare workers”.\n\nVienna-based paper Kronen Zeitung said “several thousand people” marched through the eastern city of Bregenz on Sunday “armed with cowbells, whistles and drums”. The protesters voiced their anger at “mandatory vaccination and other corona measures”.\n\nAustria imposed a lockdown for the unvaccinated last week, but rising infections later saw the government enact a full lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nPosters carried by demonstrators read: “When right becomes wrong, resistance is compulsory”; “Compulsory vaccination? My body, I decide!”; “We ​​want our basic rights back! No compulsory vaccination” and “Vaccination fascists”.\n\nDeutsche Welle (DW) said 30,000 people also took part in a rally in Vienna that resulted in “ten arrests, all for violating Covid-19 restrictions or use of banned Nazi symbols”.\n\n“Three young Austrians from Linz” were arrested after admitting to a plan to “ambush police officers during the planned protests, given their dissatisfaction with tighter restrictions”, DW said.

Kathy Hochul signed an executive order Sunday calling for a review of all state purchases with Russian entities, stating she won’t permit any investments that “directly or indirectly aid Russia as it commits these human rights violations and atrocities.”\n\n“As the governor of the state of New York, the 10th largest economy, larger than Russia, we recognize the unique power we have in joining President (Joe) Biden in economic sanctions,” she said.\n\nOther state officials announced they are building on those efforts by boycotting Russian goods and working to cut off Russia’s availability to their markets.\n\nOne prominent university announced its educational exchange coming to a close, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ending its relationship with a research university in Moscow due to “the actions of the Russian government in Ukraine.”\n\nDemonstrators protest against Russia's invasion in front of the State House on Sunday in Boston.

The UN has reported more than 100 deaths, but the true figure is feared to be “considerably higher,” the UN’s Michelle Bachelet said Monday.\n\nThe news compelled many Americans – who have tuned in to traditional and social media outlets to witness Ukrainians sharing their day-to-day fights for survival – to congregate in city parks and along busy intersections over the weekend.\n\nIn Los Angeles, a large crowd rallied for hours Saturday afternoon as cars drove by honking to signal their support, according to Mark Haynie, who was there with his wife, Anastasiia Ponomarova. The crowd was mostly Ukrainians but there were other eastern Europeans as well, he said, including Russians.\n\nHaynie told CNN Ponomarova felt few people cared when parts of Ukraine fell under the control of Russian-backed separatists in 2014 but is happy more attention has been given regarding the last week’s invasion.\n\nAt Times Square on Saturday, Olga Ladygina, who is from Kyiv, told CNN she has been emotional watching the news and trying to call her loved ones who remain in Ukraine.\n\n“I think that the whole world right now needs to unite,” Ladygina said, adding: “Now is the time to say no and stop one person who keeps in fear the whole world.”\n\nSimeon Tzolov estimated hundreds of people were at Sunday’s rally in Chicago’s Ukrainian Village, telling CNN he saw Ukrainian flags, along with those from the US, Lithuania and Latvia. Tzolov himself is Bulgarian and American, he said, but he was there to support his Ukrainian friends and coworkers, calling the conflict in Ukraine an “unjust” and “unprovoked war.”\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who said at the rally that his family originally hails from Kyiv, added that he felt it was critical to recognize the Ukrainians’ resilience and bravery during the invasion.\n\n“Today we stand in resolve against tyranny. Today we stand for democracy and today we stand united for peace and freedom for Ukraine. To the heroes of Ukraine, Illinois is with you,” Pritzker said.\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network In pictures: The world rallies in support of Ukraine Prev Next\n\nStates, business leaders review commerce with Russia\n\nWhile Western nations have sought to stem Russian economic strength by imposing sweeping sanctions, American business groups have also been quick to condemn the invasion.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce on Thursday described it as a serious breach of international law and “an affront to our steadfast belief in a world where democratic countries, following the rule of law and the free enterprise system, can be free and prosper.”\n\nEchoing those comments, the Business Roundtable, a group of leading CEOs, signaled support for holding Russia accountable, saying in a statement, “We welcome the Administration’s partnership with our allies to coordinate the most effective response to this attack and defend the rule of law.”\n\nAlong with New York, several state governments announced a halt in commerce with Russian businesses as well as more symbolic gestures such as removing Russian-branded alcohol from store shelves.\n\n“This is a small, but meaningful way to take action and show the people of Ukraine we support them while also firmly stating our opposition to the unnecessary humanitarian crisis Russia has inexcusably created,” Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said after asking for the removal of Russian-sourced liquor from ABC stores.\n\n“I encourage all Alabama citizens and businesses to explore ways they can show support for Ukraine and discourage Russia for continuing this unreasonable siege on a neighboring country,” Ivey said.\n\nSeveral states including Utah, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Hampshire declared plans to boycott Russian spirits and pull the products from shelves where applicable.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called for “decisive action” aimed to support Ukraine by announcing Saturday an immediate review of the state’s procurement of all goods and services involving Russian companies and urging an end to statewide sister-city partnerships with Russia. Youngkin urged the Virginia Retirement System and university endowments to immediately divest of Russian holdings.\n\nIn Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order announcing the state’s intent to accept Ukrainian refugees and ensure it is not contracting with or investing in Russian state-owned companies.\n\nOther states that declared similar reviews of contracts involving Russian-owned or Russian-affiliated entities include North Carolina, Indiana, Georgia and Maryland.\n\nThe US, UK and EU on Friday sanctioned President Vladimir Putin himself.", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell"], "publish_date": "2022/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/09/15/business-leaders-want-national-attention-sarasota-florida-arts-scene/8256167002/", "title": "Florida business leaders want national attention for Sarasota arts ...", "text": "In his career as a developer, Mark Kauffman has seen possibilities where others saw vacant lots. With partners or on his own, he transformed a former Maas Brothers department store into Sarasota Main Plaza and the Hollywood 11 movie theater, created the Ritz-Carlton resort, the still-new Rosemary Square complex, and others.\n\nNow he wants to bring greater awareness to the Sarasota area arts and culture scene by creating a festival that could draw national and international attention, and help local businesses. He envisions something that could develop into an event like the Spoleto Festival, in Charleston, S.C.\n\n“If we can get the major arts organizations to join this, and the smaller organizations would also join in, the concept is to bring people to Sarasota in the offseason and let them spend a week or two weeks here, and every night could be a different entertainment venue for them,” he said in a recent interview.\n\nKauffman believes having the business community behind the effort could give this new idea the support it needs, if it can win the involvement of the arts organizations.\n\nThe Downtown Improvement District has already committed $100,000 for seed money to get the new non-profit entity off the ground. It will start out under the auspices of the Arts and Cultural Alliance of Sarasota County until it can establish its own tax-exempt 501(c)3 status.\n\n“If you have to summarize it one word, the word is ‘obvious,’” Kauffman said. “The enthusiasm to anyone I mention it to is just incredible. It could grow into something really big.”\n\nThe fledgling festival has hired Jeffery Kin, the longtime producing artistic director of the Players Centre for Performing Arts, to serve as general director. Kin announced he would step away from his Players position later in the season as he begins working to get other arts organizations involved with the new event.\n\nAt this stage, there is no grand scheme or intention. Kauffman and Kin said they are open to all possibilities, but can imagine a roughly two-week period when all the arts groups present special programs marketed nationally.\n\nKauffman said the festival will also need to get a buy-in from the Chamber of Commerce, the Economic Development Council, hotels, and tourism officials.\n\nIn addition to Spoleto, which runs for about 17 days, Kauffman compared the idea to places like Niagara on the Lake and the Berkshires in Massachusetts where there are multiple performing arts organizations.\n\n“I think it’s a game-changing idea and we don’t have to invent anything,” he said.\n\nKin said with the DID investment, the festival has “a business organization investing in an idea that isn’t really tied to any one organization. We’re going to cast a really wide net. There are lots of partners here, local businesses, the city. I think what we’re finding is everyone thinks it’s a good idea, but no one knew how to do it or no one knew how to do it right. We’re bringing in outside money to get people talking, communicating and making decisions.”\n\nKin said the organization is looking at 2024 to launch the festival, but there are still many questions to be answered.\n\n“When is the best time for this festival? What should it be called? We know it’s a good idea, but we need someone to make it make sense to all the parties engaged,” he said. “That is a challenge. That’s why they’re talking three years to make it happen. It’s not something we’ll do in the course of a year.”\n\nPast festival proposals\n\nThis is not the first proposal to bring the area’s arts organizations together for an overarching event that could be marketed nationally.\n\nIn 2010, with a $1 million bonus in tourist tax money, the Sarasota County Commission established a committee to create a community-wide arts celebration that had broader ambitions. The committee hired a Toronto-based consulting company to oversee what was at one point called “Festival of the First.” It never got off the ground.\n\nIn the first seasons of the nine-year run of the Ringling International Arts Festival, local organizations were able to link to their events by being included on a master schedule. But few RIAF attendees ventured away from the international array of artists performing on the Ringling Museum campus, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, whose Baryshnikov Arts Center programmed the first five festivals.\n\nIn 2011, a 47-page special section was included in the US Airways inflight magazine touting the area’s performing and visual arts organizations. It was intended to bring added attention to what distinguishes Sarasota from other beachfront communities.\n\nAt the time, Virginia Haley, president of Visit Sarasota, said until people spend time in town and experience the cultural life they “don’t think of Florida as a cultural destination.”\n\nJim Shirley, executive director of the arts alliance, said the 2010 effort fell apart because there wasn’t enough money to support the proposal.\n\nA new approach\n\n“The biggest difference in what’s happening now is the impetus to put something together as an artist festival is coming from the business community,” he said. The fact that the DID has indicated a willingness to continue supporting the effort “if we make good advancement in funding the festival over a three-year period of time” gives organizers time to put it together.\n\nShirley said the time of year chosen for the festival must be resolved. Kauffman mentioned the summer, when businesses and restaurants could use a boost, but Shirley said many of the arts organizations are between seasons and may not be equipped to participate in ways that could showcase what they do during the regular season. He said the shoulder seasons of late spring or early fall, just after seasons end or just before they start might make more sense.\n\nJohn Moran, operations manager for the Downtown Improvement District, describes it as “a purely economic development project. To get $100,000 from the board of directors, which is not arts and culture-focused, is a challenge, and exciting to watch. But you can hear the enthusiasm there and they're willing to take that gamble.”\n\nKin said he is beginning to talk with leaders of other arts festivals. “I’m doing my homework to make sure I do this right. Every festival started in a different manner. This idea is kind of unique. A business group is investing in and, in a way, coordinating a festival.”\n\nBut he and Kauffman said if it’s done right, a small investment in the start could have big returns to make more people aware of what is available on stages and in museums.\n\nFollow Jay Handelman on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

After months of haranguing from the U.S. leader to exceed a 2% GDP spending target, nations are planning to announce a new goal of 5%.\n\nThe triumph could be a muted one as leaders focus on ending the conflict over Iran's nuclear program. Trump pushed back his departure from Washington by a day to focus on the ceasefire.\n\nIran conflict a shadow on NATO summit\n\nIran and its support for chief NATO adversary Russia were top of mind, as leaders gathered for the talks.\n\n“Let’s not forget Iran is heavily involved in the fight of Russia against Ukraine by, for example, their drone deliveries,” NATO Secretary-General Rutte said during a news conference on the eve of the gathering. “So, no doubt it will emerge in the discussions.”\n\nTrump later announced a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran that the White House hoped would put the wind at his back heading into Europe. But by the next morning, the agreement already appeared to be falling apart.\n\nThe president told reporters he thought both nations had violated the agreement. \"I'm not sure they did it intentionally, they couldn't rein people back,\" Trump said. \"I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all, and I'm going to see if I can stop it.\"\n\nLater, Trump posted that the \"Ceasefire is in effect!\"\n\nAllies to place less focus on Ukraine\n\nThe gathering, held in Rutte's hometown, comes at a critical juncture for the alliance, whose leaders fretted at last year’s summit about Trump’s possible return to power. Trump has repeatedly threatened not to defend NATO nations that don’t pay up and has pulled back drastically on unconditional U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nIn a bid to appease Trump, who has sought a negotiated end to the Russian war, allies are placing less focus on Ukraine than at past summits.\n\nUnlike in 2023, when former President Joe Biden declared that \"Ukraine's future lies at NATO,” the alliance’s NATO-Ukraine Council will not even hold a leaders-level meeting, to avoid clashing with Trump.\n\nOn the night of Trump’s arrival, heads of state will attend a social reception hosted by King Willem-Alexander at a palace. Foreign ministers and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will discuss Ukraine at a separate working dinner.\n\nRutte said nations would reaffirm their support for Ukraine at a range of meetings that will be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and members of his team.\n\n“You will see important language about Ukraine, including connecting the defense spending, up to 2035 to Ukraine, and the need for Ukraine to stay in the fight,” he said of the joint communique that leaders are expected to release.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump would personally meet with Zelenskyy, after leaving early from a Group of Seven summit where he was supposed to sit down with the Ukrainian leader last week. \"Yeah, probably,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nTrump was not listed as participating in a meeting with Rutte, the Ukrainian president and several European leaders that NATO added to the last day of its official schedule.\n\nAllies agree to increase defense spending\n\nThe emphasis of the summit will be on ending Russia's war on Ukraine, ramping up weapons production and an agreement by NATO nations to spend more of their GDP on defense, Rutte said earlier.\n\nLeaders agreed in 2023 to spend a minimum of 2%. NATO now says all of the alliance’s members are on track to meet or exceed the guideline.\n\nTrump is demanding NATO nations boost their spending to 5%, and members have spent months brainstorming creative ways to meet the new goal.\n\nThat includes a five-fold increase in air defense capabilities, thousands of tanks and armored vehicles and millions of rounds of artillery ammunition, Rutte said at a news conference.\n\nNATO nations negotiated to have infrastructure such as roads, bridges and airports and cybersecurity spending count toward a 1.5% allotment for defense-related expenditures.\n\n“This is not a grab bag that everybody can just throw additional spending into, but it’s crucial things like infrastructure that enables military mobility,” U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker told reporters.\n\nBut a last-minute dispute with Spain has threatened to derail those plans. Spain announced in April it would boost spending to 2.1% of its GDP. But Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced 5% was out of the question.\n\n\"NATO is going to have to deal with Spain,\" Trump told reporters June 20.\n\nThe United States already spends roughly 3.4% of its GDP on defense. And it is close to spending 1.5% on defense-related expenditures, the NATO secretary-general said.\n\nTrump: 5% for thee, not me\n\nTrump has been adamant that allies spend 5% of their GDP on defense. But he told reporters on June 20 that the United States should be exempt.\n\n“I don't think we should, but I think they should.

Everyone’s 200 feet away from each other and just having a chill time,” said Bollig.\n\n'Like the old days': Not Burning Man goes back to basics\n\nBurners surmised that “not Black Rock City” may be a sign of burns to come, burns where dogs and dirt bikes are welcome and there are a lot fewer rules, for better or worse.\n\n“Officially Burning Man or not, we make our home here,” said Daniel Gomes, who was all smiles after flying to the area from Miami, arriving on site at 4 a.m. Saturday with friends.\n\nHe already had the time off, so he figured why not make time to watch some desert sunrises and sunsets. On Friday night, the moon had a copper glow as it rose over the mountains.\n\nAt “Not Burning Man,” there are a lot of things that are not: traffic, fire, porta-potties, lights, speed limits, street signs, trash fences.\n\nThere are a lot of other things, however, that are: freedom to go on and off the playa at your leisure, space to camp wherever you want and stars, lots and lots of stars at night.\n\n“It feels like the old days,” said the Bay Area’s Cindy Connors of this year’s gathering.\n\nWhen Connors first came to Burning Man nearly 15 years ago, about 40,000 people came to the playa. These days, the event attracts twice that, many of the attendees paying more than $500 a head just to get into the event.\n\nThe price has risen every few years, and it’s sold out since 2011. Many people spend thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, on food, shelter, attractions and other accouterments.\n\nConnors has heard stories of the first years, when the event started as just a few dozen people on Baker Beach in San Francisco, and then when it moved to Northern Nevada in 1990.\n\nShe imagines other events such as Fourth of Juplaya, a more informal July 4 gathering, probably capture the feel of the “old days\" with family-style potlucks and humble firework displays.\n\n“This year feels like a nice reset from the big bloat that Burning Man has become,” said Connors. “It leaves space for people to camp, but it also leaves space for people to help each other.”\n\nThe Burning Man principle of radical self-reliance has been demoted for a lot of Burners in recent years with the provision of porta-potties, lighting, first aid services and ice and coffee sales, the only sales at the event.\n\nRVs and air conditioned yurts, and plug-n-play camps where hired staff set everything up for campers, also have become commonplace.\n\nFor some, having all that you could want in the middle of an otherwise inhospitable environment defeats the desire to venture out and make friends.\n\nThis year, setups were a lot more DIY and last-minute, which meant neighbors asked each other for everything from tools to chargers to mustard.\n\n“If Larry Harvey was alive, I wonder what he’d think,” said Connors, referring to the late founder of the event.\n\nPandemic burn: Social distancing in the desert\n\nStill, there was no escaping that the reason tens of thousands of people decided to stay home was because of a global outbreak of the novel coronavirus.\n\nMost campers over the weekend said they were staying with their campmates and reserving waves and socially distanced conversation for others.\n\n“It’s this whole other social layer than no one is talking about, and it makes it kind of awkward,” said Connors.\n\nShe immediately noticed people were more lackadaisical about wearing masks as she got further out from the Bay Area.\n\n“I think most people are just treating it as a live and let live situation,” said Connors, noting that camps in her area were spread out at least 100 feet from one to the next.\n\nConnors said she was staying away from large groups and gently reminding her husband that he needed to hold back on all the hugs this year.\n\nConnors also understands people’s need for connection.\n\n\"Some people are putting their mental health ahead of their physical health,\" she said.\n\nBurners largely chose not to wear their masks, neither during the triple digit temperatures, nor during the evenings when, in some instances, several dozen people danced to pulsing music.\n\n“The predominant attitude seems to be we’re outside, who cares? Which…” said Connors, shrugging her shoulders.\n\nNo fire, no problem\n\nThere were unmistakably still Burning Man vibes in the air.\n\nOn Saturday, a few makeshift mans dotted the playa, some made of sticks, others of tiki torches or welded metal.\n\nOne plywood figure was tattooed with marker. A message on the small \"man's\" leg read, \"Best un-Man COVID cancelled burn that was better next year.\"\n\nThe \"city\" was dispersed mostly among two areas: many convened in the Black Rock City imprint that showed on Google Maps, or they traveled a few miles north to what was going to be the site of this year’s canceled Black Rock City.\n\nWord spread, and the former was endearingly referred to by Burners as “Old City,” and the northern neighborhood, “Sh** City.”\n\nThe latter had more clusters of camps packed together, and a little more of everything generally, between lighting and art and music.\n\nWhile there were no three-story leviathans this year, there were a handful of pieces of art scattered around the desert, including a bamboo temple, a flying owl sculpture and a stained glass church that mocked society’s reverence for tech companies.\n\nWith fire prohibited this year due to fire prevention and control measures, only a few campers juggled flames and at least one art car sported a flaming propane barrel.\n\n“Life continues,” said Brandon Anderson, of Los Angeles, who said Burning Man didn’t really need fire to exist. “It’s about community. It’s about seeing strangers, and you have no problem running across the playa just to hug them. That's what it's about.”\n\nBurners are guessing that one or two rule breakers might go rogue when it comes to the “no fires” rule on Saturday night, the night when the “man” typically is engulfed in a monstrous bonfire.\n\nAnderson, who strapped a mask onto his own version of the man, made of tiki torches, said they might burn down their man, but he had “zero expectations” of the weekend, including burn night.\n\n“My only expectation is to walk away, my face hurting because I was smiling all weekend,” he said.\n\nThe future of Burning Man, post-pandemic\n\nEven after the coronavirus pandemic, few Burners expect the event to return to “normal.”\n\nBollig, of Atlanta, has attended several offshoot Burning Man events that take place elsewhere in the country, and he said this year’s non-Burn felt a lot like those.\n\nShould Burning Man struggle financially, or should the pandemic persist, Bollig bets that Burning Man 2021, if not beyond, will likely be a downsized, less cramped event. Burning Man Project received $2.5 million in pay protection loan funding from the federal government earlier this summer and has been fundraising continuously.\n\n“I kind of felt like there was a saturation point that we were reaching, and the culture is what people make it,” said Bollig.\n\nShould Burning Man scale back, Bollig is excited by the idea of more crafty, guerrilla art but also would mourn the potential casualty of at least some of the large-scale art installations.\n\n“You’re a drop in the bucket if you’re at Burning Man with art and you didn’t have a $10,000 Kickstarter campaign, which, don’t get me wrong, I love that art,” said Bollig.\n\nA more casual Burning Man might mean more people, however, participate in making more small-scale art.\n\nWhile everyone is hopeful that Burning Man will return in some form, most are convinced it will at least be different.\n\n“I don’t think it will ever happen again. That’s why we’re here,” said Deanna Morgan of San Francisco, who made her friend roll around in the dust and make a dust angel. It’s a tradition for first-timers.\n\nWhen asked if this year counted as her friend’s first Burning Man, she didn’t hesitate.\n\n“Of course!” said Morgan, who brought her two lapdogs, Frankie and Isabella.\n\nWhile plenty of Burners stayed home this year and instead have celebrated Burning Man by participating in the organization’s “Multiverse” virtual burn, 2020 will be remembered by many as the year that Burning Man did, but didn't, happen.\n\nWhile the running joke at the event is that it was “better next year,” this year’s joke was a little more nuanced.\n\n“It was better when it didn’t happen,” Colin Loretz, of Reno, cheekily joked while visiting the playa Friday night.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nJenny Kane covers arts and culture in Northern Nevada, as well as the dynamic relationship between the state and the growing Burning Man community.

The country has been gripped for the past weeks by a spate of suicide bombings, political upheaval and a raging civil war next door in Syria. But at least for few hours Sunday, this tiny Mediterranean country had something to cheer about.\n\nMiguel Layun, playing for Mexico in the World Cup, is of Lebanese origin.\n\nIn Beit Milleit, his northern Lebanese ancestral village, dozens of people gathered in front of a giant TV screen to cheer him on.\n\nThe 26-year-old player's posters were hung everywhere in this tiny Christian hamlet in the impoverished Akkar region. In the village's main square about 100 people sat in front of the screen.\n\n\"Nearly 90 percent of the people here support Mexico because of Miguel,\" said banker Simon Layun, a second cousin of the Mexican player.\n\nSome munching on snacks and soft drinks, others smoking water pipes, the crowd jumped up and down, danced and cheered every time Mexican players were near the Netherlands goal.\n\nWhenever Layun had the ball the crowd screamed and clapped, breaking into shouts of \"Miguel, Miguel!\"\n\nTheir support was not enough, however. Mexico led until the last few minutes, when the Netherlands scored two quick goals to win.\n\n\"I had read about it, and I really appreciate it (the support),\" the Mexico defender said after the game. \"It's people that I always have in my heart, and they deserve it. I'm very happy to know about this (their support), and it's a shame that today I couldn't bring them more happiness.\"\n\nLebanon, with a population of 4.5 million people, has seen waves of emigration over the past century to different parts of the world, mostly to Latin America where there are more people of Lebanese origin than in Lebanon itself.\n\nBrazil has the largest number of Lebanese descendants in the world while in Mexico there is a large community of people of Lebanese origin including billionaire Carlos Slim, who is one of the richest people in the world, and Mexican actress Salma Hayek.\n\nAlthough most Lebanese are supporters of either Brazil or Germany in the World Cup, many hoped Mexico would win Sunday's match.\n\nThe World Cup commentator on state-run Tele Liban said having someone of Lebanese origin playing in the World Cup is a \"dream\" that makes every Lebanese proud, calling on Layun to return to his roots and visit the \"Land of the Cedars.\"\n\nJerjes al-Saifi, the mayor of Beit Milleit, which has a population of 2,000 people, said thousands of people from the village emigrated mostly to Mexico and Brazil over the past century.\n\nSpeaking in a courtyard decorated with Lebanese and Mexican flags as well as posters of Layun, the grey-haired man said that after Lebanon's 15-year civil war began in 1975, emigration from the village shifted to countries like Canada and Australia.\n\nThe house of Layun's grandfather, Youssef, who emigrated to Mexico looking for opportunities abroad, is still there, deserted. A second cousin, Elie Layun, said he lived in it for some years until he built his own house.\n\nElie said Miguel had never visited the village although his parents did years ago.\n\nAmong those watching the match Sunday was Antoinette Abdul-Maseeh Jeitani, a Mexican-Lebanese who is currently visiting her home country.\n\n\"I always supported Mexico but because of Miguel I support it more,\" said Jeitani, who lives in Mexico City's Colonia del Valle neighborhood.\n\nAnother Mexican Lebanese, Sarkis Nehme, 10, said in broken Arabic: \"Mexico played very well and they deserve to win.\"\n\nThe late penalty that sealed the Netherlands victory left the crowd heartbroken.\n\n\"It's too bad, Mexico played very, very well. The penalty was not fair,\" he said.\n\nRoger Jeitani, a 54-year-old owner of a music shop, was the lone Netherlands supporter in the village, saying he has been a supporter of the Netherlands for 30 years.\n\n___\n\nCarlos Rodriguez in Fortaleza, Brazil, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2014/07/09/argentina-soccer-fans-celebrate-cup-final-berth/12435399/", "title": "Argentina soccer fans celebrate cup final berth", "text": "AP\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) — It was Argentina's joy, and another sting for Brazil.\n\nThe Argentine soccer team beat the Netherlands on Wednesday to win a berth in the World Cup championship match — doing it on archrival Brazil's soil, and just a day after Brazil was humiliated in a 7-1 loss to Germany.\n\nThousands of Argentina fans who traveled to Brazil for the tournament wept, kissed and raised their hands to the sky when their team won 4-2 on penalty kicks, sending it to the final for the first time in more than two decades.\n\n\"God knows we suffered, but now everything is good,\" said a weeping fan Rodrigo Aisen, who sealed the win by giving his girlfriend a long kiss. \"Everything is joy!\"\n\nThe 23-year-old celebrated with 20,000 others in the FIFA Fan Fest watch party in Sao Paulo, following a tense match in which neither team scored until the penalty shootout.\n\nArgentina and Germany will meet in the final on Sunday.\n\n\"I had faith that they would win today,\" said Maribel Oviedo, 21, who two years ago had a lung transplant because of cystic fibrosis.

We have a solid team and good people.\"\n\nFor Brazilians, the hard-fought win by Argentina only rubbed salt in the wound of their own team's worst World Cup defeat in Tuesday's match with Germany.\n\n\"If Argentina wins this Cup here in Brazil, we might as well just close the coffin,\" said Silvio Martines, 32. \"You can bury Brazil.

FRANCK FIFE/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt was another remarkable ending to a match at this World Cup, which has seen all manner of shocks and comebacks, though this one perhaps exceeded them all.\n\nSpanish referee Mateu Lahoz, known for his eccentricity and enjoyment of the limelight, certainly added to the drama, dishing out an numerous yellow cards, including one in the shootout, as he struggled to keep control of the game.\n\nThere were no less than three mass brawls throughout the 120 minutes and penalties, the first one sparked by Leandro Paredes smashing a ball straight into the Netherlands dugout at the side of the pitch.\n\nIt became difficult to keep a track of which players were being disciplined by Lahoz but according to FIFA, 18 yellow cards (two for Dumfries) and one red card were brandished during the quarterfinal.\n\nThis match will undoubtedly go down as an all-time World Cup classic, but Argentina will quickly need to bring itself down back to earth ahead of the semifinal against knockout specialist Croatia.\n\nMillions of Argentines have dreamed of the day Messi emulates the late Diego Maradona and lifts the World Cup. That day is now one step closer.\n\nMessi’s World Cup swansong\n\nThe 35-year-old Messi has done everything within his powers to ensure Argentina had the best chance possible to win a first World Cup title since 1986.\n\nThere have been fleeting moments of the Messi magic football fans have grown accustomed to seeing over the years, most notably his wonderful touch and finish against Mexico in the group stages that gave Argentina a crucial breakthrough after the shock defeat by Saudi Arabia.\n\nFew fans would have placed Argentina among the favorites ahead of the tournament, but with Messi in the team’s ranks anything is possible, at any time.\n\nUnder head coach Lionel Scaloni, a former Argentine international, the team is in a better place than it has been for some quite some time and in 2021 won the Copa America, the national team’s first major trophy since 1993 and Messi’s first in the famous blue and white shirt.\n\nLionel Messi's penalty gave Argentina a 2-0 lead in the second half. Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Argentina was yet to put together a convincing 90 minutes in Qatar and defensive frailties that has hindered it in recent years undoubtedly remain.\n\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, failed to impress in the group stages but were greatly improved in the 3-1 round of 16 win over the the United States Men’s National Team and Memphis Depay’s opener in that game, a patient, probing team move, is without question one of the best goals of the tournament so far.\n\nThis was the sixth World Cup meeting between these two teams and this fixture has provided plenty of history over the years. From a Mario Kempes-inspired victory in the 1978 final to Dennis Bergkamp’s stunning goal in the 1998 quarterfinals, this rivalry was ready for another player to write their name in soccer folklore.\n\nThe opening 35 minutes were predictably cagey, with neither side willing to take much of a risk while in possession.\n\nBut, unsurprisingly, it was Messi that unlocked a stubborn Dutch defense with a ludicrous, almost impossible, moment of genius.\n\nRunning towards the left-hand side of the penalty area, the Argentina captain played an absurd reverse pass perfectly into the path of Molina, who took one touch and poked the ball past Andries Noppert.\n\nReplays showed Messi didn’t once look up to see Molina’s run; how he saw the pass, let alone played it, only he will know. Just when you think you’ve seen it all in his 18-year career, Messi still finds a way to leave mouths agape.\n\nWorld Cup madness\n\nWhen Messi stepped up to make it 2-0 from the penalty spot after 75 minutes, it looked like game over. However, if there’s one thing the World Cup in Qatar has shown, it’s that these matches are never over until the referee blows for full time.\n\nHaving offered so little for more than 80 minutes, the Netherlands opted to hammer long ball after long ball towards the Argentina penalty area, aiming for the 6 feet 6 inch substitute Weghorst and Virgil Van Dijk.\n\nWout Weghorst completed an improbable comeback for the Netherlands. Matthias Hangst/Getty Images\n\nIt paid off spectacularly, as Weghorst headed home brilliantly from Steven Berghuis’ delivery with just under eight minutes left to play.\n\nThat goal set up a grandstand finish, which included the first of three mass brawls.\n\nWith almost the very last action of the game, the Netherlands were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty area.\n\nIt looked as though either Cody Gakpo or Teun Koopmeiners were going to take a shot at goal, but the latter played an ingenious pass into Weghorst, who turned his defender and slotted the ball past Martinez.\n\nThat goal sparked wild scenes as the entire Netherlands bench emptied to celebrate by the corner flag, silencing the thousands of Argentina fans that had been so boisterous throughout the game.\n\nIt was an almost inconceivable turn of events with Weghorst, who struggled to make an impact at Burnley and is currently loaned out to Besiktas, temporarily putting a halt to Messi’s seemingly inevitable march towards a World Cup title.\n\nArgentina's players celebrate in the faces of the Dutch after the penalty shootout. Paul Childs/Reuters\n\nHowever, Messi and Argentina were not to be denied and held their cool from the spot to bring to a close an incredible evening of football.\n\nThere were further sour scenes that followed, though, as some of the Argentina team celebrated in the faces of the distraught Dutch players once Martinez had scored the winning penalty, caused tempers to flare once again.\n\nMessi is now tantalizingly close to lifting his first World Cup and it will take something special to stop an incredible player who seems hellbent on lifting the trophy he craves the most.", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/10/07/asheville-nc-flooding-western-nc-coverage-of-helene-by-citizen-times/75558032007/", "title": "Asheville NC flooding: Western NC coverage of Helene by Citizen ...", "text": "Asheville Citizen Times\n\nAsheville Citizen Times\n\nThis story was updated after it was initially published to make it free for all readers\n\nSince Tropical Storm Helene tore through Western North Carolina on Sept. 27, leaving behind wreckage, flooding, widespread power and water outages and devastation, the Citizen Times has been providing the community with ways to find help, ways to help, voices from the region, updates on recovery efforts, visuals of the storm's impact and much more.
