Al.com reports that Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport recently added kiosks offering the technology for a fee. CLEAR offers a $15 per month membership, paid annually, with various discounts for family members. After the biometric identification, passengers move to the front of physical security screening. The company says its technology is available at more than 60 airports, stadiums and other locations.\n\nCorrections & clarifications: In a previous version of this story, it erroneously stated what CLEAR members do in the security line. CLEAR is not involved with physical security. The article also incorrectly stated the number and types of locations where CLEAR is available. The program is available at more than 60 airports, stadiums and other locations.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Alaska has become the only state without an arts council following a loss of funding through state budget cuts. The Kodiak Daily Mirror reports that the closure of the Alaska State Council on the Arts last week means a $2.8 million loss of arts funding in the state. Although only $700,000 is state funding, another $2.1 million consists of federal funds through matching grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and private foundation support. Officials say those funds will no longer be available without the state council as a connecting vehicle. Officials say Alaska residents’ federal taxes will still help pay for the arts in other states through the NEA, but those funds will not contribute to the arts in their own communities.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A program that prioritizes drug treatment over jail time is credited with keeping people out of jail and saving taxpayers some money. The Arizona Daily Star reports more than 500 people struggling with opioid addiction were sent to a grant-funded Pima County “deflection” program in the past year. Based on jail booking costs, taxpayers saved $178,000 in the fiscal year that ended June 30. The effort began a year ago as a six-month pilot program in two divisions of the Tucson Police Department. Officers could recommend a suspect caught with 2 grams of opioids or less for treatment instead of arrest. Authorities say the program proved successful with nearly 120 people getting “deflected.” The county has since received $1.4 million in federal funds to expand the program.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Northwest Arkansas cities are figuring out how to handle the arrival of electric scooters, and the process will be evolving, officials say. A state law set to take effect Wednesday authorizes electric scooters vendors to set up shop in any Arkansas city. The scooters are battery-powered, have two wheels and a T-shaped handlebar and a floorboard. Riders pay to unlock them through a mobile app. The law says riders must be at least 16, and scooters have a maximum speed of 15 mph. The law allows municipalities to establish reasonable regulations for the safe operation and presence of the scooters on public property, but not ban them from the public right of way. Fayetteville’s City Council first took up a draft of an ordinance to regulate the devices July 2. Scooter companies will have to apply for a permit, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: The Sonoma County Fair has eliminated the pig scramble from Farmers Day because of rising public concern and protests over animal welfare. In the long-running event at the fair, youngsters chased and tried to capture piglets weighing 40 to 60 pounds. Officials say this year’s event Aug. 4 will instead include elementary school children carrying watermelons slicked with vegetable oil around an obstacle course in a timed race. The board president says the decision reflects a “heightened awareness” toward calls for humane treatment of farm animals at the fair 55 miles north of San Francisco.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: State wildlife officials are telling people near the Rocky Mountain foothills to keep an eye on their children and pets after a series of mountain lion sightings. Donna Kendrick says she and a neighbor saw a mountain lion recently in their backyards in west Loveland. Kendrick told the Loveland Reporter-Herald on Friday the big cat saw her and “vanished like a ninja.” Kendrick called the Colorado Parks and Wildlife department, where spokesman Jason Clay says wildlife managers are aware of the sighting. Clay says Loveland-area residents reported mountain lions twice previously this year. People have reported mountain lions six times this year in nearby Masonville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State Insurance Commissioner Andrew N. Mais is urging homeowners to review their insurance policies before the upcoming tropical storm season. Peak hurricane season in Connecticut begins in mid-August and runs through late October. Mais says policyholders should discuss with an agent or insurance company if they have appropriate and adequate coverage. Although homeowners, condo and renters insurance cover many types of storm damage, he notes that damage from flooding is excluded. Separate policies can be purchased from the federal National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer. He says now is the time to buy those policies, considering there’s a 30-day waiting period before the policy takes effect.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:From 2006 through 2012, nearly 300million painkillers were shipped into Delaware according to a Drug Enforcement Administration database published this week by The Washington Post. If those 276,177,276 pills were distributed equally, that would be 286 for every Delawarean. The data set, known as ARCOS, tracks the journey of every prescription painkiller in the United States, starting with the manufacturer that produced it all the way to the pharmacy that purchased it. In 2006, 29 million prescription painkillers landed in Delaware communities. In 2011, the year with the highest volume, that number was nearly 48 million — a 68% increase. In 2012, the most recent year of data available, the number was 41 million. More than half of the pills — nearly 150 million — arrived in New Castle County. Sussex County had the highest per capita rate in the state at 361 pills per person. Kent County saw the greatest increase in pills delivered between 2006 and 2012, going from 4.5 million to 7.1 million respectively — a 57% increase.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Developer Adrian Washington, CEO and founder of Neighborhood Development Company, has apologized for padlocking Little Jewels Daycare and Nooks Barbershop citing environmental concerns last week, WUSA-TV reports. To make amends, Washington has offered the barbershop and daycare spots in a new building paying the same rent. “We did the right thing (where) there was a clear health emergency, but we did it in the wrong way. We didn’t communicate well, we came in suddenly and people rightly felt disrespected,” Washington says. He adds it served as a valuable learning lesson even for a developer who has been in the business for more than two decades.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Augustine: An alligator that eluded capture for days in a Chicago lagoon is settling in its new home. The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park said in a Facebook post Friday that it welcomed the reptile known as Chance the Snapper with a banner, pizza and the band Chicago’s greatest hits. The park that now houses Chance recommended the Florida trapper Chicago officials flew in to capture the gator. The 4-foot, 18-pound American alligator became an instant sensation from the day he was spotted in the Humboldt Park lagoon and photos popped up online. Investigators don’t know why the animal was in the lagoon, but experts say it wouldn’t have survived the winter. Park director John Brueggen says Chance will stay alone for 90 days to make sure he is illness-free, and then join other gators.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia Power intends to rely more on solar power than in past years to deliver energy to homes and businesses. It will also close a coal-fired power plant in the northwest part of the state. WABE-FM reports that it’s part of the company’s long-range energy plan, which was recently approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Under the plan, Georgia Power will close its coal-fired power plant near Rome. Also part of the plan: the company says it will add more wood burning to its energy mix. Georgia Power has proposed an increase in rates by about 7 %. Hearings on that matter are scheduled to begin later this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuki: The governing authority for Maui’s water utility plans to study the feasibility of buying and maintaining an irrigation system that diverts stream water from east Maui and delivers it other parts of the island. The county Board of Water Supply voted Thursday to establish a subcommittee to study the issue, The Maui News reported. Alexander & Baldwin developed the East Maui Irrigation system a century ago to supply water to its sugar cane fields in central Maui. The company last year sold the cane fields to Mahi Pono, which is growing a variety of crops on the land. The system, which is today owned by A&B and Mahi Pono, has also supplied 35,000 residents in Upcountry with water. These water users have been in limbo after a bill that would have authorized the state to extend A&B’s water permits failed at the state Legislature in May. A&B’s diversion permit expires in December. The bill’s failure raises questions about the permit’s renewal and the delivery of water to end users after that date.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: In February, Idaho Fish and Game drastically cut the number of moose tags because of population declines across the state. In 2019-2020, there will be only 634 moose tags available each year, a 22% decrease from 2017-2018, which also saw an 8% reduction compared to 2015-2016. The Panhandle region of Idaho saw a 45% reduction in moose tags, the largest in the state, and the elimination of antlerless tags. Wildlife biologists do not have clear answers for the drop in moose population, but the likely suspect is a combination of habitat loss, ticks and predators. Idaho Fish and Game does not know exact moose population numbers but estimates there are 10,000 to 12,000 in the state. To estimate populations, Idaho Fish and Game relies on harvest information.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Thousands of people have visited the governor’s mansion since it reopened last year after renovations that cost $15 million. The State Journal-Register reports that the governor’s office says more than 29,000 people have toured the mansion. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner spearheaded the renovations because maintenance had been neglected. Recent former governors rarely used the mansion before the renovations. But Rauner lived there and now Gov. J.B. Pritzker has moved in. The mansion offers exhibits highlighting the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago and life during the Civil War. An “Art of Illinois” project also showcases 80 pieces of fine and decorative art. The mansion has hosted free weekly concerts this summer. The mansion is open daily from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for guided tours.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: The Navy is planning to commission its new USS Indianapolis combat vessel at a northwestern Indiana port this fall. The ceremony marking the ship’s entry into the Navy’s active fleet is set for Oct. 26 at Burns Harbor along Lake Michigan. It is the fourth military vessel carrying the Indianapolis name. The second USS Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese submarine in July 1945 while returning from a Pacific island where it delivered key components for the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Only 317 of its nearly 1,200 crewmen survived the sinking and days in shark-infested waters. The ship was built at a Marinette, Wisconsin, shipyard and will be based near Jacksonville, Florida. It is a Freedom-class littoral ship designed to be highly maneuverable for missions such as mine-clearing and anti-submarine warfare.\n\nIowa\n\nCoralville: Iowa State University is dropping claims of wrongdoing against a former employee and paying her $225,000 to resolve a legal dispute over its popular outdoor sculptures made from Legos. As part of the settlement, Iowa State has also taken several steps to restore the reputation of Teresa McLaughlin. Iowa State President Wendy Wintersteen has written her a glowing letter of recommendation calling her an honest, innovative employee. The school also will dedicate a bench for McLaughlin in Reiman Gardens, the campus landmark that McLaughlin spent most of her career building as its director. Those steps will resolve a contentious three-year legal dispute that derailed Nature Connects, the traveling Lego art program conceived by McLaughlin. McLaughlin had accused the university of failing to pay her commissions. The university accused her of working to market competing exhibits.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: A local zoo says two of four red panda cubs born last week have died. Officials with the Lee Richardson Zoo say one of the male cubs died of injuries “of an unknown origin” shortly after he was born. Another female cub died while being cared for by her mother. The cubs were among quadruplets born last Wednesday to Ember, a 9-year-old red panda. The zoo says only 1% of red panda litters are quadruplets. Ember and the cubs are expected to be on public display in late September or early October. Until then, footage of mom and cubs will be available on the zoo’s social media accounts.\n\nKentucky\n\nNewport:The city’s plans to install a SkyWheel at the Newport on the Levee can move forward, the city announced Monday. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approved the permit for construction of SkyWheel, the observation wheel planned for the riverfront, according to the city. Construction on the 230-foot tall SkyWheel will start as soon as possible. It will feature 30 climate-controlled gondolas and will be built at Newport on the Levee, right next to the Newport Aquarium, by Koch Development of St. Louis.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Mississippi River is finally low enough again to let the Army Corps of Engineers begin closing a huge spillway after a record-breaking run diverting water into Lake Ponchartrain. The corps says Monday in a news release that about 10 of the 168 open bays in the Bonnet Carré spillway would be closed by day’s end. Spokesman Matt Roe says full closing is expected to take about a week, with daily checks to make sure the river remains low enough to avoid stressing the city’s levees. The spillway was created to limit the river’s rush past New Orleans, keeping it below 1.25 million cubic feet per second – an amount that would fill the Empire State Building in 30 seconds. The spillway was opened May 10 for the second time this year.\n\nMaine\n\nStonington: A group of Maine lobstermen that has the backing of the state’s Congressional delegation is pushing back at a plan to protect endangered whales with new fishing regulations. A federal team has called for the removal of half the vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales. Lobstermen from the Maine coast gathered with three members of the delegation and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills in Stonington on Sunday to make the case the new rules would put an unfair burden on a key state industry. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, who attended the rally, says right whales need help, but the government’s “one-size-fits-all risk reduction” approach might not be the best way. The whales number about 400 and have experienced high mortality recently.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Several hundred people gathered outside Johns Hopkins Hospital to protest the hospital’s practice of suing patients over unpaid medical bills. The Baltimore Sun reports the Saturday demonstration also promoted the efforts of Hopkins nurses to join the National Nurses United union. The Sun reported in May that Hopkins has filed thousands of lawsuits since 2009 against patients with outstanding bills. It reported a large portion of those lawsuits targeted residents of low-income areas. Hopkins emailed a statement to employees Saturday saying it supports its nurses right to unionize, but the union released false information about Hopkins’ debt collection practices. Spokeswoman Kim Hoppe says the court is only called on when patients stop responding and all points of contact are exhausted. She says patients can apply for medical or financial hardship.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are weighing a ban on the practice of declawing cats. Supporters of the measure say declawing is cruel and painful. They say cats rely on their paws and claws to groom themselves and to help protect and defend their bodies. The practice involves amputating a cat’s toes to the first knuckle. A bill that would prohibit declawing is scheduled for a public hearing at the Statehouse on Monday before the Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure. Lawmakers in New York last month voted to approve a bill banning the declawing of cats. The bill was sent to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Declawing a cat is already illegal in much of Europe and in several Canadian provinces, as well as in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver.\n\nMichigan\n\nArcadia:An exclusive golf course no longer encourages players to hit balls into Lake Michigan after a diver found hundreds in the water. A description on the Arcadia Bluffs website of the 12th hole overlooking the lake had said, “Go ahead and do it, everyone does,” in reference to hitting a ball into the water before striking a tee shot. The Detroit Free Press says Arcadia Bluffs removed that reference last week after inquiries from the newspaper. Golf course president William Shriver says he doesn’t want to encourage the practice. Experts say golf balls are made of plastic and rubber and aren’t good for the Great Lakes. A beverage cart employee says she was fired for discouraging players from hitting balls into the lake. Arcadia Bluffs declined to comment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:About 400 butterflies filled the sky on Sunday afternoon to celebrate lost loved ones at the eighth annual butterfly release event organized by Quiet Oaks Hospice. More than a thousand people were in attendance to listen to music, send off a butterfly, sip on root beer floats and enjoy a summer breeze by the river. In previous years, the event organizer would read off the names of those who were being celebrated during the butterfly release. But this year, attendees were invited to speak the name of the person they were celebrating and take a moment of silence to reflect.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: A group petitioning to legalize medical marijuana in the state says it needs about 28,700 more signatures to put the initiative on the November 2020 ballot. Jamie Grantham is communications director for Medical Marijuana 2020. She says organizers have gathered more than 86,000 signatures. That’s about two-thirds of what’s needed. The Commercial Dispatch reports Grantham spoke to a civic club Tuesday in Columbus. She says the state Department of Health would regulate every facet of the program, including overseeing treatment centers where products would be sold. She says only Mississippi licensed physicians could prescribe marijuana products to people with “debilitating medical conditions.” State Public Safety Commissioner Marshall Fisher says he opposes easing marijuana laws because of concerns the drug could be abused. He was a longtime narcotics agent.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Lobbyist spending in Missouri has dropped by 94% since voters approved a $5 cap on lawmaker gifts last year. A KCUR analysis of state data concludes that lobbyists spent less than $17,000 on lawmakers in this year’s legislative session compared with last year’s spending of about $300,000. Peverill Squire, a University of Missouri political science professor, says financial gifts don’t buy votes, but they can buy lawmakers’ effort and time. Squire says most of the spending is on larger events that all lawmakers can attend, which adheres to the cap rule. Kelly Gillespie, a lobbyist who heads Missouri Biotech Association, says the new rules limit educational possibilities. Gillespie’s group funded a program last year to teach lawmakers about drug discovery and health care affordability. That is no longer an option.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Glacier National Park officials are teed off over a report that tourists were hitting golf balls off Going-to-the-Sun Road during a traffic delay. NBC Montana posted a video Thursday taken by a tourist during a road construction delay that shows two men teeing off with golf clubs on the side of the steep mountain road. On Friday, Glacier spokeswoman Lauren Alley told the Missoulian the incident is under investigation. She says throwing or hurling things over Going-to-the-Sun Road has the potential to hurt or kill people or wildlife. She says anyone who spots such activity should try to record the person’s license plate number or remember their face if it can be done safely. Alley says law enforcement calls at Glacier are up 40% over last year.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Two king penguin chicks that hatched in March are now on display at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium. The first chick hatched March 14 and now weighs 26 pounds. The second hatched March 16 and weighs 32 pounds. Their genders are not yet known. The chicks will remain in a segregated “chick pen” in the Antarctic penguin habitat until they molt their nonwaterproof down feathers. It also allows the chicks to get acclimated to the habitat and the other penguins. The chicks were raised by adult males – not typical for this species. Generally, an adult female shares that responsibility. The Zoo’s Aquarium Birds staff only intervened during select feeding times to get the chicks used to accepting food by hand. The zoo has 24 king penguins: 13 males, nine females and the chicks.\n\nNevada\n\nFernley: The second-largest commercial land sale in state history is expected to bring thousands of new jobs to a northern Nevada industrial park covering nearly 7 square miles about 30 miles east of Reno. A California-based real estate firm, Mark IV Capital, outlined details of the $45 million purchase along Interstate 80. The Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada estimates more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created as a result of the potential development at what will be called the Victory Logistics District. Mark IV Capital cited location and infrastructure as reasons for its decision to acquire the property. In addition to easy railway access, it sits at a crossroad near I-80 and U.S. Highways 50 and 395.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLoudon: The state Department of Transportation will be implementing a traffic control plan for fans attending Sunday’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Foxwoods Resort Casino 301 Race in Loudon. The race starts at 3 p.m., with maximum traffic congestion occurring in the late afternoon and early evening. There will be ramp closures and other changes affecting Route 106, Interstate 93 and Interstate 393. In some areas, extra temporary lanes will be created.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Passengers traveling between New Jersey and New York have experienced rail delays of five hours or more about 17 times per year in recent years. That’s the conclusion of a review conducted on behalf of New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. The study’s findings were released Monday by the overseers of a multibillion-dollar project to build a second Hudson River rail tunnel and a new rail bridge over New Jersey’s Hackensack River. The study covered 2014 through 2018 and says the delays cost commuters almost 2,000 hours in extra transit time. They were mostly caused by mechanical problems and an aging infrastructure. The $13.7 billion tunnel project has been stalled by disputes between New York and New Jersey and the federal government over how the cost will be divided up.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: In what’s expected to be a long, contentious process, a few dozen people gathered recently for the first public meeting hosted by Public Service Co. of New Mexico on the planned shutdown of its coal-fired power plant. The utility says it wants feedback on four proposed options for replacing the power that will be lost when the San Juan Generating Station closes in 2022. The proposals are outlined in a filing made earlier this month with the Public Regulation Commission. Regulators will review the options in public hearings over the next nine to 15 months. The Albuquerque Journal reports PNM also will hold meetings in August with organizations that want to test potential changes in the different scenarios using modeling tools to determine costs and feasibility.\n\nNew York\n\nAlexandria Bay: The St. Lawrence River has been named the best bass fishery in the nation. It’s a first for the river, which borders Canada to the north and was ranked in the top 10 twice in the past four years by Bassmaster Magazine. The average weight of the entire 149-team field during a June tournament was 20.3 pounds, topped by the winning team from Sam Houston State University, which averaged 24.4 pounds a day. The Big Bass Award for that event was a 6-pound, 7-ouncer. Bassmaster Magazine editor James Hall says in some years there was internal debate over No. 1, but not this year. New York’s Lake Erie out of Buffalo was 10th.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Housing prices in Buncombe County have never been higher, outpacing even that of prices in Asheville city limits for the first time in nearly six years, data compiled by area real estate agencies show. The county's median sale price for the year's second quarter was $319,500, up more than 10% from the same time in 2018 and its highest figure on record, according to Mosiac Community Lifestyle Realty. The rise is being driven by more homes selling for more than $300,000 and fewer selling below $300,000 compared to the same time in 2018, Mosaic said. Buncombe had 732 home sales during the quarter, a roughly 8% boost from the previous year's totals. The same time period yielded 453 home sales in Asheville, also a record number for a quarter, says Mosiac.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Game and Fish Department says its workers have just completed one of the largest fish stocking efforts in the history of the agency. Crews have stocked 140 lakes across the state with more than 11 million walleye fingerlings from the Garrison Dam National Fish Hatchery. Fisheries production leader Jerry Wiegel says the Garrison Dam hatchery had to step up this year because of fish production that couldn’t be used at the Valley City National Fish Hatchery. Its source of water is Lake Ashtabula, where zebra mussels were recently discovered. Walleye already produced at Valley City here used only to stock Lake Ashtabula. Some were also sent to other states for use in lakes where zebra mussels exist.\n\nOhio\n\nRossford: Amazon says it will open two new distribution centers in Ohio. The company announced Monday that the two sites in Akron and near Toledo will bring a combined 2,500 full-time jobs. The new facility in Akron will be built on the site of a former shopping mall. The one in Rossford near Toledo is going up at the intersection of Interstate 75 and the Ohio Turnpike. Each of the two distribution centers will cover more than 700,000 square feet. Both centers will employ workers to pack and ship small items. Amazon has five other distribution centers in the state. They employ a total of roughly 8,500 workers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nChickasha: One of the last remaining Democrats from a rural district in the state Legislature says he won’t seek re-election in 2020. Rep. David Perryman announced Monday that he won’t seek a fifth-consecutive term for House District 56. The southwest Oklahoma district includes the towns of Anadarko, Chickasha, Fort Cobb, Minco and Pocasset. A minority floor leader, Perryman says it’s a “frustrating time” to be a Democrat from rural Oklahoma and that he’s disappointed with the lack of bipartisanship in the Legislature. Republicans have a 77-24 advantage over Democrats in the House. Perryman says that when he completes his term in November 2020, he plans to resume his full-time law practice in Chickasha.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state’s iconic Douglas firs are declining as the state’s summers have grown hotter and drier. Drought also is killing grand fir and might be contributing to declines in Western red cedar and bigleaf maple. Oregon has experienced drought each summer since 2012, peaking in 2015. Although rainfall and snowpack have been close to average the past two years, temperatures in many areas still were above normal. Climate change is expected to increase drought in Oregon. Oregon Department of Forestry scientists conduct statewide aerial and ground tree surveys across 30 million acres each year, recording the number of dead and dying trees from all causes, including drought, storms, disease and insect damage. In 2018, about 680,000 acres contained damaged or dead trees attributed to all causes. That’s fewer than at the peak of the drought but still higher than historic levels.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkinsburg: Pogopalooza, known as the World Championships of Pogo, bounced into the city last weekend. Extreme pogo stick athletes from around the world came to town to show off their huge tricks and flips to compete for world titles in such categories as High Jump and Best Trick. The events on Saturday and Sunday weren’t just for the grown-ups. Pogo users under the age of 15 entered a “bounce off” competition and those who bounced the longest got a free pogo stick. Visitors tried their hand at pogo-sticking in a free jump area that had pogo sticks of all sizes. In addition to the main competitions, the pogo athletes attempted to break three Guinness World Records over the weekend.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: A Titanic survivor’s walking stick with an electric light she used to signal for help from a lifeboat has sold for $62,500 at an auction of maritime items. Guernsey’s auction house held the auction in Newport on Friday and Saturday. Guernsey’s President Arlan Ettinger says the top bid on Ella White’s cane was $50,000, plus the surcharge added by the auction house. The preauction estimate had been $300,000 to $500,000. The walking stick was consigned to Guernsey’s by the Williams family in Milford, Connecticut. Ettinger says some family members contested the sale. The issue was resolved before the auction, but the dispute might have made potential bidders nervous. Ettinger says the winning bidder said he was there on behalf of a friend in the United Kingdom.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: A family owned plant in Orangeburg County that makes machines for textile mills is closing after nearly 50 years. Mayer Industries Inc. CEO George Fischer says the company is consolidating its work making braiding machines at plants in Germany. Fischer told The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg that its 59 employees were told of the closing two years ago and the company has been working to help anyone find a new job. Fischer says Mayer Industries did a similar consolidation of its knitting machine business nearly 20 years ago. Mayer Industries built the Orangeburg plant in 1970 and created a course at the nearby technical college to teach workers metric measurements they would need to make machines for the European market.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A National Guard unit has been welcomed home after a nearly year-long deployment to the Middle East. A ceremony was held Sunday afternoon for the 26 members of the 935th Aviation Support Battalion at the Army Aviation Support Facility in Rapid City. KOTA-TV says community members showed their appreciation with prayer and applause. Gov. Krisit Noem told the guard members their dedication did not go unnoticed because of their exemplary work. The Rapid City-based unit provided aviation maintenance and repair support for the Army.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office says six corrections officer have resigned after an internal investigation into accusations of inappropriate conduct. The Commercial Appeal reports that the identities of the deputies were not provided. A social media post from the sheriff’s office says the investigations focused on inappropriate relationships with inmates at the Shelby County Jail. The deputies were suspended with pay in mid-June while an investigation was conducted. One of the deputies resigned in June after being charged with a personal conduct violation and consorting with persons of bad or criminal reputation, which are administrative charges. Sheriff’s Office Captain Anthony Buckner says in a video release that the investigation was halted because the deputies left the department and the office’s General Investigation Bureau did not find sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges.\n\nTexas\n\nDeer Park: The cleanup of millions of gallons of waste and polluted water is far from over four months after a large fire burned for days at a Houston-area petrochemical storage site. The Houston Chronicle reports that Intercontinental Terminals Company, the facility’s owner, must abide by a 31-page management plan that underscores how waste is sampled and identified, stored and discarded. The March 17 fire at the company’s Deer Park site, located southeast of Houston, triggered air quality warnings. More than 21 million gallons of potentially hazardous waste and contaminated water have since been collected from the tank farm and Houston Ship Channel. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office filed water pollution charges in April against Intercontinental Terminals Company, alleging the fire caused chemicals to flow into a nearby waterway.\n\nUtah\n\nAlpine: Police in northern Utah were surprised to learn the suspect in a reported burglary was a wild turkey. Dave Ventrano with Lone Peak police says they received a call on Saturday from a resident who heard a window break in the house next door. The family that lives there was out of town. Officers searched the house and found a dead turkey lying in a pile of broken glass underneath a window on the first floor of the home. Ventrano said the turkey died after flying through the window. He said there are a lot of wild turkeys in Alpine. Police gave the turkey carcass to a resident who owns a local barbecue restaurant.\n\nVermont\n\nStowe:The once-endangered common loon is making a comeback in Vermont, but not without the help of humans across the state who build islands for the birds. Eric Hanson, a loon biologist with the state Center for Ecostudies has been leading the group's efforts to manage loon populations in the state. On July 15, Hanson, volunteers from the conservation group Friends of Waterbury Reservoir and Park Ranger Chad Ummel met at the northern part of Waterbury Reservoir to grab some canoes and kayaks and paddled out to build a nesting raft for the two loons that call the artificial lake home. The raft the crew put together on the reservoir was made from a base of cedar logs. Hanson sawed notches on the logs so they fit together like Lincoln Logs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond:The state Department of Health has issued a warning to residents that there has been an increase in respiratory illnesses across the state. The health department received increased reports of respiratory, or breathing, illnesses across the Commonwealth greater than observed in previous summers. Most of the reports have occurred among older adults and those with chronic medical conditions in assisted living and long-term care facilities, the VDH said. The reports involve different regions of the state and different diseases, including pertussis (whooping cough), influenza, haemophilus influenzae infection, Legionnaire’s disease and pneumonia caused by rhinovirus or human metapneumovirus.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:The Kitsap Pride in the Park 2019 event emphasized unity: among law enforcement, churches, elected officials and community members. The Bremerton Police Department, City Council members and Mayor Greg Wheeler were among the hundreds of community members in attendance at Evergreen Park on Saturday. The Police Department took to the main stage following Wheeler's address to announce its “Safe Place” program. The program, operated by Officer and LGBTQ liaison Mitchell Chapman, will allow the department to offer a safe haven at the station for victims of hate crimes while police resolve the issue. Chapman says he will be working closely with local businesses and social services to train them on the protocols to serve as safe spaces.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nVivian: Crews have begun clearing the scene of a train derailment, where up to 20 cars went off the rails, some of which had carried hazardous materials at one point. No one was injured. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports Kimball Fire Chief Jimmy Gianato says the hazardous material train cars were empty during the Saturday crash, but will still be continually monitored becauese of possibility of a leak. After the Norfolk Southern train cars derailed near Vivian, some toppled onto their side. Others fell into the neighboring creek. The newspaper reports one was labeled “Carbon Dioxide Refrigerated Liquid.” Crews with Norfolk Southern, Emergency Railroad Services and Cranemasters worked to clear the scene Sunday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAppleton:In the midst of a sweltering heatwave that scorched more than half of the U.S., there was some good news for Appleton residents: It apparently has been worse. A Seattle news station reported Friday that Appleton is home to the hottest \"feels like\" day in U.S. history, when the temperature hit a high point of 101 degrees with a dew point of 90 degrees on July 13, 1995. That combination produced a heat index — or made it feel like — 148 degrees that day, KOMO News reported. Friday wasn't quite that hot — Appleton saw a high temperature of 90 degrees and dew points ranged from the low-to-mid 70s, says Scott Berschback, a meteorologist out of the National Weather Service office in Green Bay. Berschback couldn't confirm Friday's peak heat index, nor could he confirm the purported record.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: Two residents are trying to end the use of a gas chamber for euthanasia at an animal shelter. The Humane Society of the U.S. says Wyoming is one of just four states where shelters still use gas chambers rather than lethal injection to euthanize animals; the others are Missouri, Ohio and Utah. Animal welfare advocates say gas chambers are cruel because death often doesn’t happen quickly. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports Madhu Anderson and Eve Waggoner have been protesting the use of gas at the Rock Springs animal shelter. Anderson says lethal injection is more humane and not difficult to implement. Rock Springs Police Chief Dwane Pacheco says the shelter only euthanizes feral cats and aggressive dogs and has one of Wyoming’s few free spay-and-neuter programs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/04/wwii-anniversary-liquor-boom-tracking-app-news-around-states/113659836/", "title": "WWII anniversary, liquor boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Halfway through the first quarter, the city’s public school system is preparing to reopen its doors to students for in-person instruction come October, with the plan to send families a survey in the next two weeks about their learning preference. The survey, focused on gauging how many families are interested in sending students back into classrooms, will be available Sept. 14-18. If students do return, the district will still offer virtual learning for those who are not comfortable with in-person instruction. Montgomery Public Schools is one of nearly two dozen districts across the state that chose to delay returning to school buildings for the first nine weeks of the year. MPS teachers have been working within the schools to conduct virtual lessons. A request to disclose whether any teachers have tested positive for COVID-19 or had to quarantine due to exposure since the start of the school year was not fulfilled by the district.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to expand eligibility has prompted a rush of applications for small-business aid using federal coronavirus relief funds. The eligibility rule changes by the Republican governor prompted a wave of new applications Monday for the state-run program, KTOO reports. Under the previous rules, businesses were not eligible if they had received federal Paycheck Protection Program funds and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Dunleavy announced his administration was eliminating the restrictions Aug. 20. Businesses had applied for only $169 million of the $290 million budgeted for the program through Aug. 18. A total of $301.3 million had been requested after 812 businesses applied Monday for $55.6 million in expanded funding, said Julie Anderson, commissioner of the state Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Arizona State University has announced that some students living on campus will be moved “to reduce the density in the dorms” because of an increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases. There are 5,000 spaces available in residence halls to begin shifting students housing arrangements, officials said. The announcement came after the university reported that 775 students and 28 faculty members tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday, shortly after in-person classes started Aug. 20. Among the students, 428 live off campus, 323 are in isolation at the Tempe campus, and the remainder are in isolation at either the Glendale or downtown Phoenix campuses. “There’s not one event or one location or one activity that is contributing to the spread,” the university said in a statement. “Sometimes it’s just a couple of kids hanging out in a dorm room who take their masks off – it’s a very contagious disease, and it’s spreading.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of active cases at the University of Arkansas’ Fayetteville campus jumped Wednesday to nearly 400. The school reported 185 new cases at its campus between Sunday and Tuesday, bringing its total number of active cases to 399. “I realize that part of college life is the socialization that goes on, but in today’s environment it is important to keep in mind the social responsibility you bear to the entire society,” said Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary. “Without your help, we cannot bring this pandemic under control.” UA has been conducting testing on its campus through Thursday, which Romero has said will give the state a better sense of how prevalent the outbreak is there. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he expected more than 1,000 test results from college students to come in over the next week.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: People experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County are testing positive for the coronavirus at rates far lower than among the population at large, a health official said Wednesday as he breathed a sigh of relief about the fate of the area’s most vulnerable residents. The percentage of homeless people who tested positive for COVID-19 was 1.87% as of Aug. 27, according to LA County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis. At least 1,589 cases of the coronavirus have been identified among the homeless population, with 41 deaths, he said. Los Angeles County’s overall positive rate is 10.2%, according to the Department of Health. Mel Tillekeratne, a leading Los Angeles homeless advocate, said he believes the reason for the lower rate may be that a majority – about 70% – of the county’s homeless live outside. In addition, LA’s homeless are increasingly conscientious about wearing masks to help prevent the spread of the virus, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A motorcycle rally plans to continue with its events scheduled for Labor Day weekend. Organizers for the Four Corners Motorcycle Rally say the three-day event will be scaled down due to coronavirus restrictions. Events have limited their capacity or been canceled altogether. The Hill Climb at Purgatory Resort and concerts at Sky Ute Casino Resort have been canceled. The Hooligan Dirt Dash, which typically draws about 1,500 people, will have a capacity of 100 people. John Oakes, an organizer, said the events will encourage social distancing and face coverings. “Typically, it was like a street party,” Oakes said. “But now, it will be like a seated restaurant.” The rally had not received a permit from the city of Durango to hold the event as of Tuesday, the Durango Herald reports. But Alex Wilkinson, the community events administrator for Durango, said the event should receive the green light in time for Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont’s new choice to oversee the Connecticut Department of Correction said Wednesday that he believes the agency is better prepared for a possible new surge of coronavirus infections this fall than it was months ago, when the pandemic began and “mistakes” were made. Angel Quiros, who will become the department’s first Hispanic commissioner, said prison officials have learned much more about the coronavirus since the spring. And some policies – such as isolating inmates who tested positive at the state’s maximum-security prison and not allowing them to shower because of ventilation concerns – have been changed. Quiros said the agency has been finishing a second round of mass testing, and the current infection rate is about 3%, compared to 9% earlier in the year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Latino‌ ‌children‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌state‌ ‌‌have been ‌infected‌ ‌with‌ ‌COVID-19‌ ‌at‌ ‌a vastly ‌disproportionate‌ ‌rate,‌ an‌ ‌analysis‌ ‌of‌ ‌state‌ ‌data‌ found.‌ ‌Between April and June, about ‌47‌% ‌to‌ ‌60%‌ ‌of‌ ‌children‌ ‌diagnosed‌ ‌with‌ ‌the illness ‌were‌ ‌Latino, according to state data. Latinos make up about 16% of the child population in Delaware. Latinos of all ages,‌ ‌particularly‌ ‌those‌ ‌living‌ ‌in‌ ‌Sussex‌ ‌County,‌ ‌have‌ ‌the‌ ‌highest‌ ‌rate‌ ‌of‌ ‌infection‌ ‌among‌ ‌any‌ ‌racial‌ ‌group‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌state‌ ‌– five times as high as white residents.‌ ‌That led to state health officials significantly increasing testing in Latino communities. Doctors began knocking on doors, urging people to get tested. Community advocates helped find alternate housing for those who needed to quarantine and organized groceries for those who couldn’t leave their homes. In the past month, the state has seen a significant drop in the number of new positive cases among Latino children, but the rate is still disproportionate.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district has seen far fewer tourists compared to the pre-coronavirus era, WUSA-TV reports. According to data released by Destination D.C., before the pandemic, the city welcomed about 24.6 million visitors, with visitation up 4.1% in 2019. The tourism supported about 78,266 jobs in the city and brought $8.2 billion in visitor spending and $896 million in local tax revenue to the district. With 10 consecutive years of significant visitation growth in the city, Elliott L. Ferguson II, president and CEO of DDC, said he believes only about 11 million domestic visitors will travel to the city in 2020. That’s about 53% less than the previous year. Ferguson projected that if a vaccine is available as early as next year, and the economic impact of the pandemic doesn’t get worse, visitation could bounce back and climb to 20 million by 2022.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The highbrow Art Basel fair, known for glamorous parties and celebrity sightings, on Wednesday announced the cancellation of this year’s event amid the coronavirus pandemic. The prestigious December art fair draws collectors, socialites and celebrities from around the world to Miami. But the pandemic’s impact on international travel restrictions and other quarantine factors left little choice but to postpone the annual event until 2021, according to a statement from the organization. At the same time Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a new $13 million ad campaign to encourage Floridians to vacation in the state. The video ad encourages people to take advantage of the state’s golf courses, beaches, fishing and other outdoor activities. He made the announcement in Daytona Beach along with Visit Florida CEO and President Dana Young. DeSantis said it’s safe to visit theme parks and other Florida destinations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: With more than 3,000 public university students and employees across the state testing positive for COVID-19 since Aug. 1, some schools are taking action to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. Georgia Tech is encouraging students to convert to single rooms, moving out roommates over coming weeks to reduce exposure to the coronavirus. Both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia announced they are renting more off-campus rooms to isolate or quarantine students who have been infected or exposed to the virus. UGA reported 821 new infections for the week ended Saturday, a number that President Jere Morehead said Wednesday is “concerning.” He urged students to “continue to make every effort to prioritize their health and safety by taking the proper steps to avoid exposure to this virus.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: When Japanese military leaders climbed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945, the battleship was packed with U.S. sailors eager to see the end of World War II. On Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the surrender, some of those same men who served the United States weren’t able to return to the Missouri in Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor because of the world’s new war against the coronavirus. The commemoration initially was supposed to be a blockbuster event with parades, movie premieres, galas, and thousands of people honoring the veterans in their 90s or beyond, some who may be marking the milestone for the last time. Because of the threat of the virus, the ceremony was scaled down to about 50 people, with local veterans and government officials gathering on the USS Missouri in masks. The names were read of surviving WWII veterans, including 14 who were on the ship the day the Japanese surrendered.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will remain in the fourth and final stage of reopening during the coronavirus pandemic for at least another two weeks, Gov. Brad Little said Thursday. Little said hospitalizations of those infected remain too high, but other areas, such as the positivity rate, are improving. He also encouraged getting flu shots, saying that flu patients combined with COVID-19 patients could threaten health care capacity. A shortage of medical supplies or patient beds could cause the state to fall back to more restrictions. “These variables threaten our health care capacity – the very thing we are trying to protect so that our economic rebound can continue,” Little said. Johns Hopkins University data through Wednesday shows Idaho has seen a total of more than 32,000 coronavirus infections and 372 deaths.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is ramping up enforcement of restrictions on student activity after more than 330 COVID-19 cases in two days on the school’s Urbana-Champaign campus, school officials said Wednesday. In an email to students, Chancellor Robert Jones said he expects all undergraduates to “limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities” for the next two weeks. “These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention,” Jones wrote. Meanwhile, Illinois State University in Normal is reporting about 1,025 students have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the fall semester two weeks ago, nearly 5% of the student body.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning Hoosiers to take coronavirus precautions seriously over the Labor Day weekend even as new statewide COVID-19 risk ratings show most counties with minimal or moderate virus spread. The new county-by-county map available on the Indiana State Department of Health’s website Thursday gives a red rating of high spread to only Martin County in rural southwestern Indiana. Seven other counties, including South Bend’s St. Joseph County, Muncie’s Delaware County and Terre Haute’s Vigo County, have orange ratings of moderate to high spread. The remaining 88 counties received yellow or blue ratings based on the number of new cases per 100,000 residents and the percentage of tests confirming COVID-19 infections. The map is meant as a guide for school leaders on whether to keep students in classrooms.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: As the state sees some of the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the nation, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday that she will wait to determine whether her move to close bars in six counties slows the virus’s spread before considering additional steps. Reynolds said the soaring number of confirmed virus cases is largely due to infections among young people, especially those in the college towns of Iowa City and Ames. Reynolds said she would make $10,000 grants available to the bars, taverns breweries, wineries and other businesses that sell alcohol in those counties to help them get through another shutdown. She also said she supported Iowa State’s decision to allow 25,000 fans into a Sept. 12 football game, even as Ames sees some of the country’s highest rates of coronavirus infections. However, Iowa State announced a short time later that it had changed its plans and wouldn’t allow fans to attend. The game will be televised.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Amid intense pressure, the state’s largest school district has overturned its decision to call off all fall sports and activities because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Board of Education for the 50,000-student Wichita district reversed itself Tuesday after members were flooded with emails and phone calls pleading and demanding that sports be allowed to continue. The outcry included a massive demonstration at Wichita Northwest High School. Athletes also had stood outside the board’s meeting space holding signs and chanting following the initial Aug. 20 cancellation decision, The Wichita Eagle reports. District schools will only compete against each other during the regular season but would remain eligible for postseason play. Some of the state’s other large districts have called off fall sports, including Shawnee Mission and Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signaled Wednesday that he expects to extend his mask mandate again later this month, saying the facial covering requirement is “more important than ever” amid efforts to reopen schools and protect the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. For a second straight day, the governor reported more than 800 new coronavirus cases in Kentucky. He said statewide cases appear to be “creeping up, and we need to watch it.” He later said the state is in “a dangerous place” in battling the outbreak. The state is approaching a total of 50,000 cases and nearing 1,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Beshear reported 18 more virus-related deaths Wednesday, raising the death toll to 36 in the past three days. Despite the high number of cases, the Democratic governor insisted his requirement that people wear masks in public is working and indicated the order will be extended again later in the month.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards is asking a federal judge to order the state’s elections chief to broaden the use of absentee-by-mail voting for the fall elections because of the pandemic. The Democratic governor filed the request with the court Wednesday in an ongoing lawsuit by voting rights advocates seeking to widen mail-in balloting options for the Nov. 3 presidential and congressional election and a Dec. 5 state runoff. “The governor asks this court to protect the right to vote – and just as importantly, the health and safety of the people of Louisiana – by ordering the implementation of an election plan that sensibly addresses the current pandemic and safeguards constitutional rights,” wrote Edwards executive counsel Matthew Block. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, the Republican who manages Louisiana’s elections, has proposed a limited expansion of absentee-by-mail voting for those who are confirmed to have COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday extended a state of emergency for a sixth time during the pandemic. In a statement, Mills urged Mainers not to let “pandemic fatigue” allow them to become complacent, especially as students are returning to schools and universities across the state. “The outbreaks which we hear about in other states every day can sometimes feel far away from the relative safety of our state, but recent events prove that one little match can spark a fire that may be very difficult to put out,” she said, referring to outbreaks associated with a recent wedding in the Katahdin region. A state of civil emergency allows Maine to draw down critical federal resources and to deploy all available tools to contain COVID-19. Such orders are issued in 30-day increments.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The mayor said Wednesday that the city won’t immediately follow some other parts of the state into the third phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. “We do not want to erase the gains we’ve made over the past month,” Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young said at a news conference, local media outlets report. Young said he anticipates moving Baltimore into the second recovery phase next week, which would allow restaurants to expand their indoor dining capacity. He said additional details would be announced at a later time. Young’s announcement came a day after Gov. Larry Hogan announced all businesses in Maryland would be able to open later this week under Phase 3. But any local jurisdiction can decide not to open as much as the state plan allows.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Nearly 150 arts and cultural organizations are sharing in $815,000 worth of grants from the city’s Arts and Culture COVID-19 Fund, the city announced Thursday. The fund was established this summer with federal stimulus money to support small and midsized nonprofits to help them adapt their programs, spaces and operating models to comply with coronavirus regulations. “Supporting the organizations that bring transformative arts programming to every neighborhood in our city is imperative during this unprecedented time,” Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement. Boston’s arts and culture sector typically generates $1.35 billion in total economic activity, according to Americans for the Arts’ Arts and Economic Prosperity 5 report, but has been hit hard by the pandemic. The Mass Cultural Council reported that cultural nonprofits in Massachusetts have lost $425 million in revenue with 17,000 jobs.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday in favor of the state order mandating coronavirus testing for all farmworkers in Michigan. The court’s decision was cheered by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and immigrant advocates who say the order protects farmworkers, most of whom are Latino immigrants. In a 3-0 ruling, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request by farm owners in Michigan for a preliminary injunction to block the state order issued Aug. 3. In a lawsuit filed after the order, a group of farm owners had maintained that the state order unfairly targeted farms and was discriminatory because the workers affected are mostly Latino. But in its ruling Wednesday, the federal appeals court said that blocking “the testing ... poses a substantial risk of harm to others given that identifying and isolating COVID-19-positive workers limits the spread of the virus.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota announced a plan this week for students to return to three of its campuses after the school’s decision to delay move-ins and in-person classes. According to the plan, sent via email to students, faculty and staff from University President Joan Gabel, students will be able to move into dormitories Sept. 9 at the Duluth campus, Sept. 15 at the Twin Cities campus and Sept. 18 at the Rochester campus. The plan comes after a decision last week by the university’s Board of Regents to delay residence hall move-ins and the start of most in-person classes at the three campuses for two weeks. The plan outlines four steps that become increasingly less restrictive over time, including limiting on-campus activities and movement, limiting access to campus facilities, and lifting curfews in later steps. All four steps emphasize students wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Gov. Tate Reeves on Wednesday defended his practice of referring to the new coronavirus as the “China virus.” Reeves has used the phrase several times, including in social media posts. Reeves supports President Donald Trump, who has also used the phrase. During a news conference Wednesday, Reeves was asked about his use of the phrase, including whether such language could be used to bully people of Asian descent. “I don’t condone anyone bullying them,” Reeves said. “I don’t condone mask bullying, either.” Reeves added: “Had this virus not escaped from – however it occurred – from the lab in China, I don’t know that we’d be having the kind of conversations that we’re having all day, every day. And that’s just a fact.” Trump and some of his advisers have repeated the unsubstantiated theory about the virus originating in a virology lab in China.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: More than four months after state Attorney General Eric Schmitt sought to hold China and the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic, the lawsuit remains stalled in federal court. Neither the Chinese government, the Communist Party nor the officials named in the lawsuit have filed a response, KCUR-FM reports. Missouri served the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing with summonses July 17. Under U.S. law, a foreign state or agency has 60 days to respond after being served. That means the defendants’ deadline to respond could be as soon as late September. But because U.S. law generally grants foreign states immunity, most legal experts agree the case isn’t likely to go anywhere even if the defendants do respond. Chris Nuelle, a spokesman for Schmitt, declined to say what steps the attorney general’s office would take if China simply ignores the lawsuit.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday announced a new loan program to spur economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus, as applications for unemployment assistance increased in Montana for the third consecutive week. Nearly 2,400 residents submitted new applications during the week ending Aug. 29, an increase of 3% from the previous week, according to figures from the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. Since mid-March, the state has processed more than 141,000 new claims. Nearly one-third of the state’s workforce has been unemployed at some point during the pandemic. The Montana Working Capital program will provide loans of up to $500,000 to businesses affected by the virus. It will utilize funds that were originally allocated to a loan deferment program, which allowed Montana businesses to defer payments on existing loans.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has quarantined four of its sports teams after some athletes tested positive for the coronavirus, and data shows the state approaching 400 COVID-19 deaths. UNO shut down workouts this week and quarantined members of its men’s basketball, women’s softball, men’s baseball and women’s volleyball teams, the Omaha World-Herald reports. That came after the results of 13 UNO athletes who were tested Friday came back positive for the virus. None of the UNO athletes who tested positive has shown any symptoms, UNO Chancellor Jeffrey Gold said Wednesday. The state’s online tracker shows that as of Thursday, nearly 35,000 people have tested positive for the virus, and 399 have died from it. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has risen over the past two weeks from 256.43 new cases per day Aug. 19 to 318 new cases per day Sept. 2.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state coronavirus contact-tracing application called “COVID Trace” launched last week should work well with a similar tool that Google and Apple are rolling out to alert people who might have been exposed to COVID-19, officials said Wednesday. “They actually run in parallel and complementary,” Julia Peek, deputy Nevada health administrator, said after reporting 20,000 downloads since the state app debuted Aug. 24 for Apple and Android phones. The free app is designed to let phones anonymously and automatically exchange data by Bluetooth and notify a phone user if they’ve been near someone who tested positive for COVID-19, if that person has granted permission and added their phone ID to a database of positive cases. Peek told reporters that widening the notification net should also help reach visitors to Nevada from states that don’t have similar COVID-19 tracing technology.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State public health officials provided new guidance this week on when schools should switch teaching models based on community transmission of the coronavirus and its impact on individual schools. The guidance sets out criteria for rating the level of community transmission in a county or city as either minimal, moderate or substantial based on the percentage of positive tests, infections per capita in the previous two weeks and the number of new hospitalizations per capita during that time period. School districts also are advised to rate their level of school impact as low, medium or high based on the transmission within the facility, student absenteeism and staff capacity to conduct classes. Using those two levels, districts can consult a matrix that recommends an appropriate teaching model.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: The federal government has fined a state-run veterans’ home in the city more than $21,000 for mixing up the identity of a veteran who died from COVID-19 during the chaos of the pandemic in April and for shortcomings in infection control. Eighty-one residents of the New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home and a nurse’s aide have died from complications of coronavirus, and four residents are currently hospitalized, according to the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which operates the home. The death toll is among the highest in the nation at any long-term-care facility. Two local congressmen have called for the home’s CEO, Matthew Schottlander, to resign, and one of the largest state veterans organizations, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, has asked for a criminal investigation into the deaths at Paramus and another state-run veterans’ home in Menlo Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A top state health official warned Wednesday that COVID-19 infections are far more prevalent in low-income areas of the New Mexico, potentially straining Medicaid health care. Human Services Secretary David Scrase said an analysis of infection rates by census tract shows that highly impoverished areas have infection rates seven times higher than the most affluent zones. “This means Medicaid is going to see way more than its proportionate share of cases in the course of the pandemic,” he said. About 38% of New Mexico residents are enrolled in federally subsidized Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program for people living in poverty or on the cusp. Health officials are concerned that socializing over the Labor Day holiday weekend could lead to renewed surges in COVID-19 infections – citing the aftermath of Memorial Day and Independence Day holidays.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo says he won’t let New York City reopen its restaurants for indoor dining until it comes up with a plan to make sure they are following regulations to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. The governor said he thinks restaurants should open in New York City, but the state doesn’t have enough personnel to monitor the city’s 27,000-plus eateries. “These institutions are under dire economic circumstances,” Cuomo said Thursday. “And we know that compliance has to happen.” Cuomo is facing pressure from the restaurant industry, which has seen business plummet amid the pandemic and hundreds of workers seeking unemployment assistance. More than 300 restaurant owners who want to reopen have sued New York City and the state, seeking more than $2 billion, over the continued ban on indoor dining.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Legislature finalized a plan Thursday to spend $1.1 billion of the state’s remaining COVID-19 relief funds from Washington, including direct cash payments to nearly 2 million families. The package – which also provides a $50 uptick in weekly unemployment benefits and more funds for virus testing, tracing and personal protective equipment – cleared its final legislative hurdle with a lopsided House vote. The measure, which cleared the Senate on Wednesday, now heads to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Although many of his spending recommendations were ignored by Republican legislative leaders, Cooper has not publicly criticized the measure and has shown no signs of vetoing it. Money is also being spent to expand rural broadband, help struggling small businesses and recruit poll workers on Election Day. Families with at least one child will receive $335 in stimulus-style payments by mid-December.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state set a near-record Thursday for the number of daily positive coronavirus tests and has increased its per-capita figures for the infection to the highest in the country. The state Health Department’s update showed that 360 of the 12,629 tests in the past day came back positive, with Cass, Grand Forks and Stark counties each reporting 60 or more positive cases. Of the 32 counties with positive tests, Grand Forks County led the way with 79. The counties of Burleigh and Morton, which have been monitored in recent weeks by a special task force, combined for 43 new cases. North Dakota recorded of high of 373 positive tests statewide Aug. 28. It now ranks first in the country in the number of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Student coronavirus cases at Ohio State University jumped by nearly 400 since last week, according to data released by the university late Wednesday. Ohio State’s data dashboard showed 882 positive cases among students from Aug. 14 through Aug. 31. That’s about 3.13% of all students tested. Test results for Monday, the most recent 24-hour testing period for which data was available, showed higher positivity rates. Among on-campus students, 5.7% tested positive Monday. The same day, about 9.66% of students living off campus tested positive. In an email to the campus community, President Kristina M. Johnson said the 5.7% positivity rate among on-campus students Monday was a slight decrease from the 5.86% rate last Thursday, showing that students who were wearing masks and keeping distance were having an impact, she said. The 9.66% off-campus rate Monday “is not as encouraging,” she said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state reported 909 newly confirmed coronavirus cases Thursday and 14 more deaths due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported 61,027 cases and 835 deaths, up from 60,118 confirmed cases and 821 deaths Wednesday. The actual number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The White House Coronavirus Task Force continues to recommend a statewide mask mandate, which Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he will not issue. The task force’s Aug. 30 report, released Wednesday by the health department, also calls for closing bars and limiting the number of people allowed inside restaurants. The department reported 8,745 active virus cases and said 51,447 people have recovered.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The rate of positive coronavirus tests in the state dropped to 4.4%, the lowest it has been in two months, officials from Oregon’s health authority said Wednesday. The weekly amount of cases also continued to decline, decreasing 8.6% from the previous week. The Oregon Health Authority reported three new COVID-19-related deaths and 140 new confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases Wednesday, bringing the state total to 27,075. The state’s death toll is 468. The age group with the highest incidence of reported infection remains 20 to 29 years old. On Tuesday, Gov. Kate Brown announced she was extending her declaration of state of emergency for an additional 60 days ahead of Labor Day weekend. She also urged Oregonians to continue to follow coronavirus safety regulations during the holiday weekend, warning that celebrations could “sow the seeds of COVID-19 outbreaks” and “set us back for months.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Temple University announced Thursday that the majority of classes will shift online through the end of the fall semester amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases among students. In a statement attributed to the university’s president and provost, the university said it had tried in-person classes because students had overwhelmingly expressed a preference to come back to campus. But after talking to officials at the city Health Department, the university’s leadership decided to shift about 95% of classes online. Students living on campus can opt to leave by Sept. 13, and the university will refund charges for housing and meal plans. But officials said students will be allowed to stay, and services such as health services will remain in place. The cases at Temple have been the cause of a recent uptick in cases recorded in Philadelphia. The city has worked with the university’s health services department to conduct contact tracing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Three employees of the contractor that runs a state campground are temporarily off the job after one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement Wednesday from the Department of Environmental Management. The employee who tested positive is part of a team that cleans restrooms at Burlingame State Campground in Charlestown. Because restrooms are closed while being cleaned, the staff has little interaction with public. The workers also wear gloves and masks. The worker, who learned of the positive test result Monday, worked four days while symptomatic, last working Sunday, the department said. The employee’s co-workers were tested Tuesday and will remain out of work until results come back. The state’s campgrounds reopened June 30 at limited capacity. At Burlingame, the state’s largest campground, the state reduced capacity by 15%.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate agreed Wednesday to allow all voters to cast absentee ballots because of the COVID-19 pandemic but rejected a proposal by Democrats to allow ballots to be placed in drop boxes. Instead, absentee ballots will still have to be mailed in or dropped off in person at voting offices in each county if the bill is approved by the House and signed by the governor. The bill passed unanimously, but the drop box proposal and others, such as allowing early voting, were rejected by 24-16 or 25-16 votes on party lines, with Democrats on the losing side. Republicans spent only a few minutes arguing for their proposed changes during Wednesday’s session. Most settled on making small, careful changes that they said balanced safe voting with preventing fraud. Democrats said Republicans were risking the health of people in a state where almost 2,650 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has been named the worst in the nation for COVID-19 after a surge in cases in the past week. The state reported 2,152 cases in the past seven days, or 243 cases per 100,000 people. That’s the highest amount of cases per 100 in the nation, according to tracking done by The New York Times. By the Times’ count, Iowa is second and North Dakota third. The worst of the spread in South Dakota is in Clay County, home of Vermillion and the University of South Dakota, which has reported 205 cases in the past seven days. That’s 1,457 cases per 100,000 people, according to the Times, and puts Clay as the seventh-worst county in the nation. Other South Dakota counties that are seeing a surge: Potter (650 per 100,000), Gregory (526), Meade (487), Codington (486), Brookings (470) and Fall River (432).\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are bracing for the likelihood they will see more violations of Metro’s public health orders, particularly as they look to expand what residents and businesses are allowed to do during the coronavirus pandemic. But the city is running out of people to enforce those rules. So Mayor John Cooper wants the ability to deputize additional city workers to help. The burden of the city’s mask mandate and other orders has stretched the capacity of the Metro Health Department, already tasked with testing, contact tracing and enforcing existing health regulations. Nashville council members will consider two pieces of legislation for final approval Sept. 15 that would broaden enforcement ability in certain Metro departments that already have permitting power and would extend citation authority to any city employee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday stopped, for now, a plan to send more than 2 million mail-in ballot applications to registered Houston-area voters before the November election. The temporary stay comes after GOP activists sued Harris County elections officials over intentions to send a mail ballot application to all registered voters in the state’s most populous county, regardless of whether they’re eligible to vote by mail. Texas generally limits mail voting to citizens with disabilities or those 65 or older and is one of the few states not allowing more people to vote by mail this year over COVID-19 fears. Texas’ GOP leaders have resisted calls to expand mail balloting, keeping them aligned with President Donald Trump who has claimed that making it more widespread could increase election fraud and uncertainty. There is no evidence of widespread fraud through mail-in voting.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: An organization calling itself Utahns for Medical Freedom has filed a referendum to repeal a citywide mandate that would require people to wear facial coverings indoors and outdoors in public areas and at large gatherings during the pandemic. The group filed the referendum Tuesday, KSTU-TV reports. Mayor Michele Kaufusi previously vetoed the ordinance, but the Provo City Council overrode the veto last Thursday. City Recorder Amanda Ercanbrack said the referendum will not appear on this year’s ballot because the deadline has already passed. Utahns for Medical Freedom must now collect 3,200 signatures to qualify for the November 2021 ballot. Ercanbrack said the city would not implement a stay on the mandate until the petition has received enough signatures. The ordinance is currently in effect and set to expire Nov. 15.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Coronavirus testing clinics are being held in the city over three days as the state responds to an outbreak traced to a lodge. The Wednesday-through-Friday testing at the Rutland Regional Medical Center is in addition to the Vermont Health Department’s pop-up clinic that was held Wednesday at the Asa Bloomer state office building. Health officials are responding to an outbreak of at least 14 cases traced to people who attended or close contacts of people who attended a private party held Aug. 19 party at the Summit Lodge at Killington. Vermont officials say the lodge followed all the protocols, and officials have helped with the state investigation. In a statement, the Summit Lodge said no members of its staff are exhibiting symptoms of the disease, but two people will be tested as a precautionary measure.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority brought in $1.2 billion in revenue during the 2020 fiscal year in a nearly $120 million increase from the previous year, even as the coronavirus pandemic left restaurants and bars shuttered for months. It’s the second year in a row the liquor agency surpassed $1 billion in gross revenue, which was bolstered by retail sales with the switch to online ordering, curbside pickup and shipping amid the pandemic, the authority announced Wednesday. But the figures revealed the pandemic’s negative effects on licensed establishments such as restaurants and bars. The authority loosened restrictions to allow for delivery and takeout of alcoholic beverages and expanded patio access, but sales still dropped by 19% as retail sales increased by 18%, news outlets report, citing the data.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State officials are providing nearly $100 million in rental assistance as a part of the federal coronavirus relief bill. The state Department of Commerce said its program focuses on preventing evictions by paying up to three months of rent to landlords of eligible participants. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed off on the funding, which passes the state money through county governments. The county then contracts organizations that have a history of providing rental assistance, said Ted Kelleher, the managing director of the Housing Assistance Unit at the Department of Commerce. “I get calls, at least one an hour, from a person who is in a critical situation,” Kelleher said. “Everyone is working as fast as they can, faster than it’s ever happened before. He told KING-TV that the $100 million in coronavirus aid bill funding will not be enough but is a good start.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Two days after bars around West Virginia University were allowed to reopen, Gov. Jim Justice shut them down indefinitely Wednesday, citing crowds of unmasked students and an increase in positive coronavirus cases. “Please, kids, we have got to bear down here,” Justice said at a news conference. “You are absolutely running the risk of killing somebody.” Photos circulating on social media showed lines of people without masks outside Morgantown bars as some businesses advertised “Taco Tuesday” specials. WVU started classes last week. In a letter Wednesday, WVU President Gordon Gee said students must make “the right choices” in order for the campus to remain open during the pandemic. On Thursday, the university reported its highest number of daily coronavirus cases among students for the second straight day with 48 confirmed cases out of 408 tests given, for a positive case rate of 11.8%.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Milwaukee County has seen a six-week decline in positive COVID-19 cases, signaling that measures taken by the county and the city could be helping slow the spread of the disease. “I definitely believe that the mask ordinance is helping,” retiring city Commissioner of Health Jeanette Kowalik said. “When you look at other communities across the country, you could see the rates were better than the ones that didn’t have them.” A downward trend in average new cases per day began around the same time the mandate went into effect. The seven-day average in Milwaukee was at one of its highest points July 11 and has continued to drop every week since then. The focus on enforcing the mask ordinance in Milwaukee has been on businesses, which Kowalik said seems to work better than citizen-based enforcement.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Public Defender’s office faces staffing losses that could severely affect its service to residents because of a 10% budget cut. State budget cuts eliminated about $3 million for the office that provides defense attorneys for court cases, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Public Defender Diane Lozano told the Legislature last year that her office was overburdened by heavy caseloads and struggled to retain attorneys. Lozano said in May that her office could no longer accept misdemeanor cases in Campbell County because of the overload and lack of attorneys for cases. When Lozano directed the Campbell County office to stop handling misdemeanors, 4.5 public defenders were handling the workload of 7.5 attorneys, a budget document said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/04/20/tc-energy-to-up-the-horsepower-and-pollutants-of-the-petersburg-compressor-station/70132064007/", "title": "Petersburg and Prince George could see more pollutants coming ...", "text": "NOTE: This story has been updated to include a statement from TC Energy.\n\nPetersburg and Prince George residents could very likely see an increase in toxic pollutants in their area soon, as a natural gas company plans to upgrade its compressor station located in Prince George bordering Petersburg.\n\nWhat is a compressor station and why is this important?\n\nTC Energy delivers natural gas to the Hampton Roads area by way of underground pipelines that run through Petersburg, Prince George, Surry, South Hampton, and Sussex. This natural gas is used for the Hampton Roads residents and businesses for heating, electricity generation, and to power stoves.\n\nGas is moved through the pipelines by compressor stations, which pressurizes the gas so that it can travel. Natural gas needs to be pressurized every 40 to 100 miles.\n\nTC Energy’s compressor station is located at 1596 Baxter Road in Prince George—right next to the Petersburg border. This location has gas-fired turbines, responsible for compressing the gas, and the turbines have smoke stacks, or “chimneys” that emit pollutants.\n\nThough the compressor station is technically in Prince George county, TC Energy brands it as the \"Petersburg Compressor Station.\"\n\nTens of thousands of miles of pipelines, dozens of leaks and spills\n\nTC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, has nearly 58,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and supplies about one-quarter of natural gas to consumers in North America, according to their website. It also has 3,000 miles of pipeline that transport crude oil.\n\nPerhaps TC Energy’s most infamous pipeline is the Keystone Pipeline. This 2,687-mile pipeline, which pumps crude oil from Canada into refineries across the U.S., has been known for its oil leakages. It's had nearly two dozen spills since it started operating in 2010.\n\nTC Energy’s most recent oil spill and the largest in its history happened this past December, when the Keystone Pipeline leaked about 500,000 gallons into a creek in rural Kansas. It’s also the largest oil spill in the U.S. in the past decade.\n\nThe plan to widen the pipeline requires more power to keep the gas moving\n\nTC Energy says they need to bring more gas to the Hampton Roads region to accommodate a greater demand. In order to do so, they will widen the pipeline from a 12-inch diameter to 24 inches. Fifty miles of the pipeline will be replaced, starting from Sussex to Chesapeake.\n\nThey have dubbed this project the “Virginia Reliability Project,” and they intend to start construction mid-2024 and finish by the end of 2025.\n\nThe compressor station will have to power more gas through the wider pipeline. This in turn will increase the pollutants emitted at the compressor stations. They have two compressor stations in the area--one located in Prince George and the other in Emporia.\n\nHow will this affect the immediate surrounding area?\n\nThose living around the compressor station will bear the brunt of the health impacts, says Itai Vardi, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute.\n\nDoubling the horsepower of the compressor station in Prince George will see an increase of pollutants in the air. The pollutants emitted by the compressor station include particulate matter, gases and chemicals harmful to human health such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. In addition, it emits pollutants harmful to the ozone layer such as carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nThe ozone levels for Petersburg are already elevated. “So any additional sources of ozone precursors is not ideal,” said Amy Townsend-Small, an Environmental Science professor at the University of Cincinnati who looked at the city’s ozone levels.\n\nCarbon monoxide levels will be increased to 98.63 tons per year with more horsepower, according to the emissions chart provided to the Federal Emissions Regulatory Commission (FERC) by TC Energy. This measurement is just a smidgen under the Title V threshold of 100 tons per year.\n\nCarbon monoxide is odorless and colorless. Though undetectable to the human senses, low exposures to this poisonous pollutant can cause fatigue, headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Inhaling high levels of CO may cause vomiting, confusion, a loss of coordination and consciousness, and even death.\n\nThe levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide will exceed the safety integrity level (SIL) standards for those living within .6 miles of the compressor station, according to the report released by FERC, the government agency tasked with regulating the transmission of natural gas and electricity. These gasses can also affect the lungs.\n\nThe fine particulate matter and the formaldehyde emitted at the compressor station “threaten human health at any level of exposure,” said Claire Horan, an associate attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. At low levels, breathing in formaldehyde can cause irritation in the eyes and throat. Higher levels of exposure can cause wheezing and change the lung function.\n\n“These increases in localized air pollution are of even greater concern because the Petersburg Compressor Station is located in and near to environmental justice communities,\" said Horan. “Environmental justice communities often disproportionately bear the adverse environmental impacts of gas infrastructure projects and are often particularly vulnerable to the health risks of these pollutants.\"\n\nShould a region already vulnerable to health risks take on more?\n\nThe compressor station is situated in a residential neighborhood. Homes stand nearby along Baxter Rd. and adjacent streets. Less than a mile away sits a high school academic learning center, a nursery, churches, and two apartment complexes: Liberty Pointe and Pinetree Apartments.\n\nResidents of this majority-Black city already suffer many health disparities, and a more powerful compressor will put the residents’ health at a greater risk, says community advocate Lafayette Jefferson.\n\nPetersburg has consistently ranked as the unhealthiest or one of the lowest out of all 133 cities or counties in Virginia each year since the Population Health Institute began compiling data in 2010.\n\nPetersburg’s average life expectancy, at 66.2 years, is over a decade behind the state’s average, at 79 years. And the city already has the highest asthma hospitalization rate in the Central region, according to a 2018 report by the Virginia Department of Health.\n\n“We already have severe disparities and this could cause greater impact, especially in low income and communities of color,” said another community advocate Pat Hines, who is leading the effort to resuscitate the local chapter’s NAACP.\n\nExposure to these types of pollutants over longer periods of time results in larger impacts, and some age groups including the elderly and children are more vulnerable, says Horan.\n\nThe compressor station has been running since the ‘50s, with no end in sight.\n\nWhy doesn’t TC Energy install an environmentally friendly compressor station in Prince George?\n\nTC Energy will be building a new hybrid compressor run by electricity that would not produce emissions in their other station in Emporia.\n\nSo why doesn’t TC Energy also install a hybrid compressor in Prince George?\n\nVardi thinks it’s because only a few years ago, TC Energy spent millions of dollars to install new gas-fired turbines. TC Energy spent around $45 million on the new turbines, according to a letter the company sent to FERC the regulating body.\n\n“They’re not going to change that, not for the health of the people around the station,” said Vardi. “So at the end of the day, this boils down to money and whose health is being valued.”\n\nLiving in the 'sacrifice zone'\n\nTC Energy is planning to ship all the increased gas capacity down to the Hampton Roads area and sell it to the gas utility in that region.\n\n“In that sense, Petersburg is not \"benefitting\" at all from an increase in the gas supply, it's only left with the pollution — which, by definition, is what a 'sacrifice zone' is,” said Vardi.\n\nTC Energy says that this project will bring 26 jobs to the region and a one-time pulse of economic activity to Prince George, including $1.1 million in associated labor income.\n\nThere is no major construction needed on the compressor station. TC Energy plans to install two new gas coolers.\n\n“That is minimal work,” said Vardi. “This is certainly not a boom to the local economy or workforce in any way. It's minimal and temporal.”\n\nPublic hearing on April 25 will give you 3 minutes to speak your mind\n\nFERC will be holding a public hearing on Tuesday, April 25 from 5-8 p.m. at the Appomattox Event Center located at 9 W. Old Street in Petersburg. Citizens will get three minutes each to present their thoughts.\n\n“My major concern is that I didn’t even know that this was going on,” said Hines, who only found out about TC Energy’s plans a week ago when the company is already far along in its process of getting their plans up and running.\n\nAccording to Vardi, TC Energy says that it does not need a new air permit for the doubling of the horsepower since it already received one from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality in March 2020, shortly after it installed two new gas-fired turbines.\n\nAt that time, however, TC Energy stated that only one of the turbines will be operational while the other will be turned off and serve as back up. Now, TC Energy is asking FERC to approve the certification of turning on the second turbine without going back to the VDEQ for a new air permit.\n\n“That's problematic since a VDEQ air permit requires a robust public notification and comment process, which has been taken away from the residents of Petersburg,\" said Vardi.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTC Energy released the following statement: “The Virginia Reliability Project (VRP) will continue to build on TC Energy's commitment to invest in emissions limiting technology for our assets in Virginia. Upgrading the existing natural gas pipeline will not only create more than 3,500 jobs and generate over $500 million in economic output for Virginia, it will also help protect our environment by replacing a 70-year old pipeline with new technology that reduces emissions and improves safety enhancements. That’s why the VRP has strong bipartisan support from leaders in the region and across the state. We look forward to continuing our robust community outreach program which provides project information and invites dialogue with local residents and businesses that may be impacted by VRP construction, especially those in environmental justice communities. The VRP team has also committed to utilize local small, women, and minority-owned businesses for the project to the greatest extent possible.”\n\nJoyce Chu, an award-winning investigative journalist, is the Social Justice Watchdog Reporter for The Progress Index.

One of the nation’s most respected coaches, Tony Bennett has turned Virginia into a powerhouse, but he’s still heavily associated with his home state of Wisconsin. He played for the UW-Green Bay from 1989-92 and finished his career as the Mid-Continent Conference’s leader in points and assists, and his 49.7 career 3-point percentage is still an NCAA record. He played at UWGB for his father, Dick, who ultimately went on to lead the Wisconsin Badgers to a Final Four appearance in 2000. He was named to the inaugural Hall of Fame class for the Summit League, formerly the Mid-Con. As a high-school player at Green Bay Preble, Bennett was named Wisconsin's Mr. Basketball in 1988. Virginia’s top player two years ago, Malcolm Brogdon, won Rookie of the Year in the NBA last year playing for the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nTourney trip: 22nd (five straight years). Tourney record: 29-22. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Kyle Guy, 14.1 ppg. Best name: Francesco Badocchi\n\n(16) MARYLAND-BALTIMORE COUNTY – Joe Sherburne. The Whitefish Bay High School product competed out east at Brewster Academy after leaving the area and was named to the America East All-Rookie Team in 2015-16. The marksman has been among the best 3-point shooters in the nation at points in his career, and he's started the majority of UMBC's games this year, hitting 42.5 percent of his shots from distance and averaging 10 points per game. He had a huge block in the closing minutes against Vermont in the America East title game, leading into the game winning basket.\n\nTourney trip: Second (first since 2008). Tourney record: 0-1. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Jairus Lyles, 19.9 ppg. Best name: Ishmail Jabbie\n\n(8) CREIGHTON – Toby Hegner. The 6-10 native of Berlin, Wisconsin, Toby Hegner is in his senior season for the Bluejays, scoring close to double figures in his fifth and final year within the program (including a redshirt freshman season). He set the school record at Berlin with 1,213 points and 500 rebounds, part of a first-team All-State showing as a senior.\n\nTourney trip: 21st (two straight years). Tourney record: 12-21.

Leading scorer: Kevin Knox, 15.5 ppg. Best name: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\n\n(12) DAVIDSON – The Curry Legacy. It's hard to hear the name \"Davidson\" without thinking of Steph Curry, the Golden State Warriors superstar who has two NBA championships and MVP trophies in his pocket. After starring at Davidson (where he famously took down the Badgers in the Sweet 16 one year), he's become one of the best players in the world. His father, Dell, also had a long NBA career and spent one year with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1999. Speaking of names, Davidson shares a name with one-half of one of Wisconsin's biggest manufacturing brands, Harley-Davidson. Company co-founder Arthur Davidson was a Scot who probably never visited his namesake in North Carolina.\n\nTourney trip: 14th (last in 2015). Tourney record: 8-14.

Best name: Jon Axel Gudmundsson\n\n(4) ARIZONA – Sean Miller’s origins. One of the perennial storylines in the NCAA Tournament is the focus on a coach who has never been to the Final Four despite a successful résumé. For the past few years, it’s been Miller, whose quest was thwarted twice by Wisconsin in the Elite 8 in 2014 and 2015. Miller’s coaching career actually began in Wisconsin, where he was a graduate assistant for the 1992-93 Badgers team that featured Michael Finley in his sophomore year, Tracy Webster as a junior and sophomore Howard Moore, now an assistant coach for the Badgers.\n\nTourney trip: 35th (six straight years). Tourney record: 56-33. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2015 Elite 8, 85-78; Lost to Wisconsin in 2014 Elite 8, 64-63; Defeated Wisconsin in 2006 first round, 94-75; Lost to Wisconsin in 2000 second round, 66-59. Leading scorer: Deandre Ayton, 20.3 ppg. Best name: Talbott Denny\n\n(13) BUFFALO – Nate Oats and Lance Leipold. Both the program's basketball and football coach have connections to UW-Whitewawter. Hoops coach Nate Oats grew up in Watertown, then played college basketball at Maranatha Baptist, a Division III program close to home. He began his coaching career as an assistant at UW-Whitewater in 2000-2002 before taking a high-school job in Michigan. He began as an assistant at Buffalo in 2013 and became head coach in 2015, where he has now overseen two MAC championships. On the football field, Jefferson native and UW-Whitewater graduate Lance Leipold is best known for his work as a football coach at Whitewater before leaving for the Division I opportunity at Buffalo. Leipold won six NCAA Division III national championships while head coach at Whitewater in eight seasons, along with a runner-up finish, and he's in the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Former Germantown High School standout Lamonte Bearden played on the 2016 Buffalo team that reached the NCAA Tournament before transferring to Western Kentucky.\n\nTourney trip: Third (last in 2016). Tourney record: 0-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: CJ Massinburg, 17.3 ppg. Best name: Ikenna Smart\n\n(6) MIAMI (Fla.) – Trey McKinney-Jones. In 2013, Miami went to the Sweet 16 and lost to Marquette, with South Milwaukee graduate Trey McKinney-Jones as one of the starters. McKinney-Jones played overseas after his days with the Hurricanes and, on Feb. 20, signed a 10-day contract with the Indiana Pacers to get his first taste of the NBA. It's pretty impressive for someone who wasn't even an All-State selection in high school. Miami's strength coach, Steve Felde, is a Milwaukee native who graduated from Concordia University in Mequon and also worked as the strength and conditioning director at UW-Milwaukee from 2007-12.\n\nTourney trip: 10th (three straight years). Tourney record: 8-9. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Marquette in 2013 Sweet 16, 71-61. Leading scorer: Lonnie Walker IV, 11.5 ppg. Best name: Deng Gak\n\n(11) LOYOLA (Chicago) – Porter Moser. The Loyola head coach is from Illinois, but he does have a number of area connections. He spent one year on the staff at UW-Milwaukee as he was working his way up in the early 1990s and also coached for four years at St. Louis under coach Rick Majerus, one of the most notable Wisconsinites in the coaching profession. He also recruited Germantown's Ben Averkamp to Loyola, where Averkamp finished with more than 1,000 points, 500 rebounds and an Academic All-American nod. Other top players in Wisconsin to play a full allotment of years at Loyola include Andy Polka (Oshkosh West) and JR Blount (Dominican), who was the Ramblers' MVP in 2008 and 2009 and finished in the school's top 10 career totals in points and assists.\n\nTourney trip: Sixth (last in 1985). Tourney record: 9-4. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Clayton Custer, 13.7 ppg. Best name: Aher Uguak\n\n(3)TENNESSEE – The Admiral's brother. Tennessee junior forward Admiral Schofield is the younger brother of O'Brien Schofield, who played football at Wisconsin before enjoying a solid NFL career that included a Super Bowl trophy with the Seattle Seahawks. The younger Schofield leads the team in rebounding and is second in scoring. Not only that, but strength and conditioning coach Garrett Medenwald is a native of Green Bay and played college football at UW-Whitewater, where he played for back-to-back national champions in 2010 and 2011.\n\nTourney trip: 21st (last in 2014). Tourney record: 19-21. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 1983 first round, 57-56. Leading scorer: Grant Williams, 15.3 ppg. Best name: Yves Pons\n\n(14) WRIGHT STATE – Billy Wampler and Sharif Chambliss. The Eau Claire Regis sophomore Wampler is redshirting this season after transferring from Drake, but he'll be on the roster next year along with current Pewaukee High School senior Grant Basile, who's having a huge finish to his career and committed to WSU earlier this year. Assistant coach Sharif Chambliss, a Racine St. Catherine's alumnus who also played for a year at Wisconsin, was there to watch Basile's 29-point performance against Whitnall in an electric sectional semifinal. Wampler started 16 games and played in 31 last year for Drake, averaging 9.6 points and 2.5 rebounds per game. Regis finished 26-1 and qualified for the Division 3 state tournament when Wampler was a senior in 2015.\n\nTourney trip: Third (last in 2007). Tourney record: 0-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Grant Benzinger, 14.5 ppg. Best name: Loudon Love\n\n(7) NEVADA – Belvedere goes to college. The University of Nevada campus in Reno was the filming location for the 1949 American comedy \"Mr. Belvedere Goes to College,\" following genius Lynn Belvedere as he enrolls in pursuit of a four-year degree in just one year. Initially arising in the book \"Belvedere\" by Gwen Davenport, the character was part of several movies and, of course, a sitcom that ran from 1985 to 1990, where Christopher Hewitt plays the title role and serves as a butler for the Owens family. The patriarch of that family, George, was played by none other than Bob Uecker, the famous radio voice of the Milwaukee Brewers. Uecker maintained his full-time gig with the Brewers during the filming of the series. Far less tangential, Nevada head football coach Jay Norvell, who just completed his first year as head coach after 31 seasons as an assistant in college football, is a Madison Memorial graduate who also served as offensive line/wide receivers/special teams coach at Wisconsin from 1989-94, meaning he was on the staff when the Badgers won a Rose Bowl.\n\nTourney trip: Eighth (two straight years). Tourney record: 4-7. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Caleb Martin, 19.1 ppg. Best name: (tie) Jazz Johnson and Nisre Zouzoua\n\n(10) TEXAS – Shaka Smart. The Oregon, Wisconsin, native was able to squeak the Longhorns into the Dance despite a tumultuous third season at the helm of the Longhorns. Before he jumped from Virginia Commonwealth to take the job at Texas in 2015, there was ample speculation that he would be in line to take the Marquette position that opened when Buzz Williams departed. Smart was famously reported to be accepting the job, and even when that felt through, many felt he was a potential successor to Bo Ryan at Wisconsin. Instead, Smart went a different direction — south. The former second-team All Conference choice as a player in the Badger Conference was an assistant at Clemson and Florida before becoming head man at VCU, where he led the Commodores to an improbable Final Four in 2011. The last time Texas made the dance two years ago, Northern Iowa hit a half-court buzzer beater that banked in for a stunning 75-72 win over the Longhorns. The guy who hit that shot: Merrill High School product Paul Jesperson.\n\nTourney trip: 34th (last in 2016). Tourney record: 35-36. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Wisconsin in 1997 first round, 71-58. Leading scorer: Dylan Osetkowski, 13.6 ppg. Best name: Mo Bamba\n\n(2) CINCINNATI – Oktoberfest. The largest Oktoberfest celebration in the United States is in Cincinnati, bringing roughly 500,000 people each year. Wisconsin, of course, loves itself some Oktoberfest celebrations, with notable festivals in Milwaukee, La Crosse, Appleton and New Glarus. With roughly 40 percent of the state’s population claiming German heritage, September is frequently a time to drink beer and dance. Popular Milwaukee-based sports radio talk show host Bill Michaels, who has a statewide network and can be heard in the Milwaukee area on 105.7 FM, The Fan, was born and grew up in Cincinnati. He’s been on Milwaukee’s radio waves since 1999.\n\nTourney trip: 32nd (eight straight years). Tourney record: 45-30. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 1994 first round, 80-72; Lost to Marquette in 1977 first round, 66-51. Leading scorer: Jacob Evans, 12.9 ppg. Best name: Cane Broome\n\n(15) GEORGIA STATE – Special team. Second-leading scorer Devin Mitchell is a cousin of former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard, now an ESPN analyst on College GameDay. He's known for his prowess at the University of Michigan, but to Green Bay Packers fans, he's better known as the MVP of Super Bowl XXXI, when Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots, 35-21, at the Superdome in New Orleans. The glorious game took place Jan. 26, 1997.\n\nTourney trip: Fourth (last in 2015). Tourney record: 2-3. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Wisconsin in 2001 first round, 50-49. Leading scorer: D'Marcus Simonds, 20.9 ppg. Best name: Malik Benlevi\n\nEast region\n\n(1) VILLANOVA – Bradley Center bombshell. On Jan. 24, 2017, defending champion Villanova was ranked No. 1 in the nation, and the Wildcats were up 15 points in the second half against Marquette at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. But the Golden Eagles stormed back, and Katin Reinhardt’s free throws with 11.6 seconds left helped Marquette stage a 74-72, court-storming victory — the second time the program had beaten the team ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll (matching the 2003 Elite Eight win over Kentucky). Nova had been ranked No. 2 in the coaches poll at the time. It was a great moment for Marquette, which scrapped together enough wins to make the tournament that year. Nova, meanwhile, finished 31-3 and wound up as a No. 1 seed — but then didn't make it out of the second round when Wisconsin brought them down in an upset, 65-62. Don't mess with Wisconsin teams, Wildcats.\n\nTourney trip: 38th (six straight years). Tourney record: 58-36. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2017 second round, 65-62; Defeated UW-Milwaukee in 2014 first round, 73-53; Defeated Marquette in 1980 first round, 77-59. Leading scorer: Jalen Brunson, 19.4 ppg. Best name: Donte DiVincenzo\n\n(16) LONG ISLAND-BROOKLYN – Long Island. Wisconsin has a Long Island, too! Technically, they have like six of them with the name, but the most notable one is part of the Apostle Islands on the shores of Lake Superior. Technically, our Long Island is a peninsula, and it's unlike any of the other Apostle Islands in that it has no obvious bedrock pedestal and is made almost entirely of sand. It was added to the ranks of the Apostle Islands in 1986 as part of a congressional act, and it's about 4 miles long and only a few hundred yards wide. New York's Long Island is bigger. It also has enough people on it to be the 13th most populated state in the union if it decided to break ties with New York.\n\nTourney trip: Seventh (last in 2013). Tourney record: 0-6. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Joel Hernandez, 20.5 ppg. Best name: Ganlandou Cisse\n\n(16) RADFORD – Flag of our Father. One of Radford's most notable alumni is actress Jayma Mays, who is best known for her work in television show \"Glee\" and a handful of big-screen comedies like \"Epic Movie\" and \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop,\" but she also had a small role as a nurse in Clint Eastwood's 2006 \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" where she interacts briefly with John Bradley, played by Ryan Phillippe. The real-life Bradley, whose son James' book is the basis for the movie, is a Wisconsin native born in Antigo and raised in Appleton who was supposedly one of the U.S. Navy corpsmen who famously raised the American flag on Mt. Suribachi over Iwo Jima in a scene depicted by a Pulitzer Prize photograph and now a sculpture in Washington, D.C. There was controversy in 2016 when it was determined Bradley, though he was at Iwo Jima and likely helped to erect a smaller flag, was not actually in that photograph.\n\nTourney trip: Third (last in 2009). Tourney record: 0-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Ed Polite Jr., 13.6 ppg. Best name: Ed Polite, Jr.\n\n(8) VIRGINIA TECH – Buzz. Brent Langdon “Buzz” Williams has become a controversial figure in Milwaukee, where he led the Marquette men’s basketball team to an Elite Eight, two more Sweet 16s and five NCAA Tournaments during his six-year tenure as head coach from 2008-14. He left after the 2013-14 season somewhat abruptly, got the Hokies in the Dance for the first time in a decade (facing Wisconsin in the first round last year, no less), and now has done it back-to-back years.\n\nTourney trip: 10th (two straight years). Tourney record: 6-9. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2017 first round, 84-74; Defeated UW-Green Bay in 1996 first round, 61-49. Leading scorer: Justin Robinson, 13.8 ppg. Best name: Khadim Sy\n\n(9) ALABAMA – Avery Johnson and Bucks coaches. Alabama coach Avery Johnson has had a long career in basketball, and one of his mentors — and obstacles — along the way has been Don Nelson, who is familiar to Milwaukee fans as the innovative Milwaukee Bucks coach and general manager from 1976 to 1987. Johnson played for Nellie with the Golden State Warriors and then assisted him on the Dallas Mavericks staff before succeeding Nelson as head coach in 2005. Johnson was NBA Coach of the Year in 2006 and enjoyed significant early success. His 2007 team had the best record in the West but was famously defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors, a team coached by ... Nelson. It's one of the biggest upsets in modern NBA history. In 2010, Johnson became coach of the Brooklyn Nets, but he was fired in late 2012 and eventually replaced by Jason Kidd, who stayed for one season before becoming coach of the Bucks from 2014 through the middle of this season, when he was himself fired and replaced on an interim basis by Joe Prunty. By the way, Prunty served on Johnson's staff during Johnson's full tenure with the Dallas Mavericks. Johnson also once called a timeout just to chew out Wauwatosa East and Wisconsin product Devin Harris, who played approximately three NBA seasons on teams coached by Johnson.\n\nTourney trip: 20th (last in 2012). Tourney record: 21-20. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 2006 first round, 90-85; Lost to Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2005 first round, 62-59. Leading scorer: Collin Sexton, 19.0 ppg. Best name: Lawson Schaffer\n\n(5) WEST VIRGINIA – Firsts and lasts. Next year, Kaukauna's Jordan McCabe will become the first West Virginia recruit out of the state of Wisconsin to lace up for the Mountaineers. The dynamic point guard has helped Kaukauna become one of the top teams in the state, regardless of division. The Mountaineers' last player taken in the first round of the NBA Draft was Joe Alexander, taken with the eighth overall pick in 2008 by the Milwaukee Bucks (somewhat infamously). Before that, West Virginia hadn't had a first-round pick since Ron \"Fritz\" Williams, the first African-American men's basketball player at WVU who went on to play eight seasons in the NBA and also scored a career-high 38 points in the Milwaukee Arena when WVU beat Wisconsin in 1965. It's the only time the Mountaineers have won in Wisconsin in seven tries.\n\nTourney trip: 29th (four straight years). Tourney record: 29-28. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Jevon Carter, 17.0 ppg. Best name: Sagaba Konate\n\n(12) MURRAY STATE – Down the stretch they come. The Racers have a tradition during football games in which Racer-One, a thoroughbred jockeyed by a student at the school, takes a lap on the track around the field after every touchdown. Located in Murray, Kentucky, the school isn't far from horse country. Wisconsin's best connection to thoroughbred racing is trainer D. Wayne Lukas, born in Antigo and holder of 14 Triple Crown race victories — most of any trainer in history. He also has won 20 Breeder's Cup races. Jockey, the underwear and sleepwear manufacturer, houses its headquarters in Kenosha. Former Iola-Scandinavia football player Austen Lane attended Murray State before spending five years in the NFL (he retired after the 2014 season). Briggs and Stratton, a manufacturing outfit headquartered in Wauwatosa, also has a plant in Murray.\n\nTourney trip: 16th (last in 2012). Tourney record: 3-15. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Marquette in 2012 second round, 62-53; Lost to Marquette in 1969 first round, 82-62. Leading scorer: Jonathan Stark, 21.8 ppg. Best name: Brion Sanchious\n\n(4) WICHITA STATE – Darral Willis Jr. New to the program as a JUCO transfer from Mississippi last year, Darral Willis made the All-Newcomer Team last year in the Missouri Valley. He played his prep career at Madison Memorial, where he broke out as a senior to become an All-State selection in Division 1. He averaged 17.3 points per game and 10 rebounds en route to being Big Eight Player of the Year as a senior. He averaged double digits in scoring for most of the current season after the Shockers relocated to the American Athletic Conference.\n\nTourney trip: 15th (seven straight years). Tourney record: 18-15. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Landry Shamet, 15.0 ppg. Best name: Rauno Nurger\n\n(13) MARSHALL – The Herd. The Thundering Herd boast one of the more unique mascots in NCAA athletics, and local sports fans are familiar with another \"Herd\" team — the Oshkosh-based G League team affiliated with the Milwaukee Bucks, the Wisconsin Herd. That team included former Bucks guard Brandon Jennings, who made some headlines Saturday when he was brought back to the Bucks on a 10-day contract. Other players such as Xavier Munford and Marshall Plumlee have seen time with the Bucks this year, as well as the Herd.\n\nTourney trip: Sixth (last in 1987). Tourney record: 0-5. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Jon Elmore, 22.8 ppg. Best name: Ot Elmore\n\n(6) FLORIDA – The Chiozza Play. If you're the type of person who holds grudges against teams that defeated your favorite Wisconsin team from the tournament in years past (like me), then you probably despise teams like Cornell, Davidson, Butler, UNLV and more. You should definitely dislike Florida. In one of the most memorable moments of the 2017 tournament, Chris Chiozza took the ball the length of the court and hit a running 3-pointer to give Florida an 84-83 win in overtime against Wisconsin in the Sweet 16. The play negated an equally memorable make by Zak Showalter to force overtime. Everyone hates Florida. Chiozza is again one of his team's top players this year.\n\nTourney trip: 21st (two straight years). Tourney record: 45-18. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Wisconsin in 2017 Sweet 16, 84-83, in overtime; Defeated UW-Milwaukee in 2006 second round, 82-60. Leading scorer: Jalen Hudson, 15.3 ppg. Best name: Egor Koulechov\n\n(11) SAINT BONAVENTURE – Franciscan order. Located in Olean, New York, Saint Bonaventure is a Franciscan university, one of 20 in the nation. In fact, the team's mascot name \"Bonnies\" is derived from a wolf that St. Francis of Assisi legendarily tamed in Gubbio, Italy. Three of those Franciscan schools are in Wisconsin (Cardinal Stritch, Alverno and Viterbo), and the Association of Franciscan Colleges and University houses its offices in Milwaukee.\n\nTourney trip: Seventh (last in 2012). Tourney record: 6-8. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Jaylen Adams, 19.8 ppg. Best name: Tshiefu Ngalakulondi\n\n(11) UCLA – A ring on it. The Golden State Warriors are one of basketball's best teams, and though Kevon Looney doesn't see the floor much (10.9 minutes per game), the Milwaukee Hamilton product who spent a year at UCLA does have an NBA championship ring from last year and might well win another. Looney has battled injuries in his career thus far, including one that delayed his start at UCLA and led to labrum surgery that truncated his rookie year in 2015-16. He won Mr. Basketball in 2014 and was drafted in the first round in 2015.\n\nTourney trip: 49th (two straight years). Tourney record: 105-41. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Aaron Holiday, 20.3 ppg. Best name: Gyorgy Goloman\n\n(3) TEXAS TECH – The day the music died. Texas Tech is located in Lubbock, Texas, where legendary musician Buddy Holly first began to make a name for himself. The city's Buddy Holly Center features a permanent exhibit to Holly and serves as a central hub for Lubbock music in general. Holly was killed, along with fellow musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson in a plane crash as the musicians tried to move more conveniently between stops on the \"Winter Dance Party\" in the Upper Midwest. The tour began in Milwaukee and made a stop in Green Bay. The second-to-last show the musicians performed came on Feb. 1, 1959, in Green Bay, and a monument is located outside the city's Riverside Ballroom, constructed in 2003. Additionally, former Aggies football coach Matty Bell (1929 to 1933) coached Carroll College football in Waukesha for one year. Today, he's in the College Football Hall of Fame. He coached Southern Methodist to a national title in 1935.\n\nTourney trip: 16th (last in 2016). Tourney record: 8-16. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Keenan Evans, 17.5 ppg. Best name: Norense Odiase\n\n(14) STEPHEN F. AUSTIN – Lumberjacks. The mascot of Stephen F. Austin is a familiar symbol in Wisconsin. In fact, since 1960, the Lumberjack World Championships are held annually in Hayward, Wisconsin, featuring 21 events for both men and women and more than $50,000 in prize money. The international field of contestants competes in such events as chopping, sawing, log rolling, tree climbing and even some team and relay events. ESPN held its own version of the event, The Great Outdoor Games, and televised them until 2006.\n\n\n\nTourney trip: Fifth (last in 2016). Tourney record: 2-4. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Shannon Bogues, 15.4 ppg. Best name: Samuli Nieminen\n\n(7) ARKANSAS – Bret Bielema. As the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin, Bret Bielema compiled a record of 68-24 in his six seasons, and he became the third coach in NCAA history to win 12 games in his first season as coach with a win over Arkansas in the Capital One Bowl. He won three Big Ten titles before Arkansas and Bielema crossed paths again, when he announced he was leaving in December 2012 to take the head coaching position for the Razorbacks. But alas, everyone's favorite ex-UW coach was fired last November — immediately after a loss to Missouri. I'm sure #karma was trending in Wisconsin shortly after Thanksgiving.\n\nTourney trip: 32nd (two straight years). Tourney record: 42-31. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 1996 second round, 65-56. Leading scorer: Jaylen Barford, 18.0 ppg. Best name: Gabe Osabuohien\n\n(10) BUTLER – The rise of LaVall. Butler alumnus LaVall Jordan is in his first year as head coach, taking the job after Chris Holtmann left to take charge of Ohio State. Jordan was brought in last season to coach at UW-Milwaukee, where he made the best of an awkward situation when the program was in turmoil following the dismissal of former coach Rob Jeter. But Jordan couldn't pass up a chance to coach Butler in the Big East. He won a conference title and appeared in the NCAA Tournament both as a player and assistant coach at Butler, and now he has the lead job.\n\nTourney trip: 16th (four straight years). Tourney record: 23-15. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Marquette in 2013 second round, 74-72; Defeated Wisconsin in 2011 Sweet 16, 61-54. Leading scorer: Kelan Martin, 20.8 ppg. Best name: Henry Baddley\n\n(2) PURDUE – Linc to the past. UW-Green Bay head basketball coach Linc Darner, who led the Phoenix to an unlikely appearance in the NCAA Tournament last year, played basketball at Purdue and was a teammate of current Purdue coach Matt Painter. The Boilermakers actually faced UWGB multiple times when Darner was there, falling by a 69-53 count in 1991 at Mackey Arena and barely getting past UWGB in the Great Alaska Shootout two years later. In 1995, when Darner was a grad assistant at Purdue, the Boilermakers barely survived UW-Green Bay in the NCAA Tournament’s first round.\n\nTourney trip: 30th (four straight years). Tourney record: 37-29. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2000 Elite 8, 64-60; Defeated UW-Green Bay in 1995 first round, 49-48; Defeated Marquette in 1969 Elite 8, 75-73. Leading scorer: Carsen Edwards, 18.7 ppg. Best name: Nojel Eastern\n\n(15) CAL STATE FULLERTON – Riley Dearring (for a minute there). Riley Dearring, a Minnetonka, Minnesota, native began his college basketball career at the University of Wisconsin before transferring to Cal State-Fullerton. He was only there for one season (2016-17) and saw action in six games, however, before electing to close his career closer to home at Bethel University, an NCAA Division III school in Minnesota. Dearring was Bethel's third-leading scorer this season.\n\nTourney trip: Third (last in 2008). Tourney record: 2-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2008 first round, 71-56. Leading scorer: Kyle Allman, 19.4 ppg. Best name: Gaber Ozegovic\n\nMidwest region\n\n(1) KANSAS – Brewster legacy. Devonte' Graham, the Jayhawks' leading scorer, attended Brewster Academy in New Hampshire as a post-graduate and led the team to a 33-0 record and the national prep championship in 2013-14. One year later, Brewster had multiple Wisconsin connections when it repeated its national prep title. Current Badger Alex Illikainen, a Grand Rapids, Minnesota, native, was a power forward on the 2014-15 team that went 34-1, and Whitefish Bay High School product Joe Sherburne, now headed to the dance with Maryland-Baltimore County, also spent his senior year on the team.\n\nTourney trip: 47th (29 straight years). Tourney record: 103-45. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 2003 Final Four, 94-61; Lost to Marquette in 1974 Final Four, 64-51. Leading scorer: Devonte' Graham, 17.3 ppg. Best name: (tie) Udoka Azubuike and Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk\n\n(16) PENN– Thearchitects of Wisconsin. Penn has a long history of distinguished alumni, and a couple of the more obscure grads had a hand in constructing notable parts of the Badger State. Bruce Graham, an architect who designed the Sears Tower and John Hancock Center in Chicago, also designed the U.S. Bank Center in Milwaukee, which remains the tallest building in the state (just ahead of the Northwestern Mutual Tower completed in 2017). John Nolen, a Penn graduate from 1897, also had a major hand in the construction of Madison, the University of Wisconsin footprint and the state park system.\n\nTourney trip: 24th (last in 2007). Tourney record: 13-25. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Ryan Betley, 14.4 ppg. Best name: Zack Kaminsky (almost Frank Kaminsky!)\n\n(8) SETON HALL – They got game. Seton Hall’s leading scorer Desi Rodriguez hails from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, New York. It happens to be the high school for which the fictional Jesus Shuttlesworth played basketball for in the 1998 Spike Lee film “He Got Game,” a story about the pressures surrounding a star player’s college choice. The role of Jesus was played by first-time actor Ray Allen, who was then a shooting guard for the Milwaukee Bucks. Allen, who spent seven seasons in Milwaukee, went on to become a 10-time All Star and will be in the NBA Hall of Fame eventually. Coincidentally, Lincoln High School is where much-hyped high-school recruit Stephon Marbury graduated in real life. The Bucks drafted Marbury with the No. 4 pick in the 1996 NBA Draft but traded him immediately for Allen, who was initially taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves at No. 5. Also, Hall's roster features Oshkosh North product Philip Flory, who sees the floor sparingly in his freshman season.\n\n\n\nTourney trip: 11th (two straight years). Tourney record: 15-11. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Desi Rodriguez, 17.8 ppg. Best name: Sandro Mamukelashvili\n\n(9) NORTH CAROLINA STATE – Russell. Wisconsin fans owe NC State a debt of gratitude. After briefly exploring his options as a minor league baseball player, Russell Wilson elected in early 2011 to transfer from NC State, where he had graduated but had a year of college football eligibility remaining, to the University of Wisconsin, and that worked out just fine for the Badgers. He threw for three touchdowns in the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game in a 42-39 win over Michigan State and very nearly led the Badgers to a win in the Rose Bowl over Oregon (ultimately a 45-38 loss). It was a year characterized by heartbreaking losses, but Wilson etched his name into permanence as a Wisconsin favorite. He then went to the pros, where he became less endearing as a four-time Pro Bowl selection with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nTourney trip: 27th (last in 2015). Tourney record: 37-25. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2005 Sweet 16, 65-56; Defeated Marquette in 1974 National Championship, 76-64. Leading scorer: Allerik Freeman, 15.3 ppg. Best name: Omer Yurtseven\n\n(5) CLEMSON – LaChance's fellow recruit. Clemson's Shelton Mitchell started his career at Vanderbilt, where he was in the same recruiting class as Brookfield Central's Riley LaChance. LaChance wound up on the SEC All-Freshman team, but Mitchell was on track to be the full-time point guard when he transferred to Clemson, where he has been the Tigers' starter the past two years. It may have opened a door for LaChance, who had to handle the point at times, as well. He leads the Commodores in assists as a senior.\n\nTourney trip: 12th (last in 2011). Tourney record: 9-11. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Marcquise Reed, 16.2 ppg. Best name: Lyles Davis\n\n(12) NEW MEXICO STATE – One (sort of) shining moment. Kettle Moraine High School boys basketball coach Brad Bestor can be seen briefly in the 1999 \"One Shining Moment\" montage, wearing his New Mexico State jersey as future Milwaukee Bucks center Jamaal Magloire of Kentucky blows by for a dunk. It's a fun relic from Bestor's brief trip to the NCAA Tournament as a member of the Aggies program, and today he can also say one of his former players has made the trip to the Dance as well. Paul Miller, who just finished his senior season at North Dakota State, appeared as a freshman during the 2014-15 season.\n\nTourney trip: 24th (two straight years). Tourney record: 10-25. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Zach Lofton, 19.8 ppg. Best name: Sidy N'Dir\n\n(4) AUBURN – Bruce Pearl. One of the most colorful characters — and oftentimes controversial characters — in college basketball coaching, Pearl has done an incredible job to get Auburn to its first NCAA Tournament since 2003, and doing so by putting his team in the top 10 of the national rankings. Of course, many remember Pearl's tenure as head coach of UW-Milwaukee, taking the Panthers to the NIT once and the NCAA Tournament twice, with a thrilling run to the Sweet 16 in 2005 before becoming head coach at Tennessee.\n\nTourney trip: Ninth (last in 2003). Tourney record: 12-8. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Mustapha Heron 16.6 ppg. Best name: Mustapha Heron\n\n(13) CHARLESTON – Khris Middleton. The Milwaukee Bucks guard is a native of Charleston, South Carolina, where the College of Charleston is located. He played at Porter-Gaud School before attending Texas A&M and getting drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 2012. He wrote a column in 2015 about a church shooting in Charleston at The Players Tribune, noting how he had encountered one of the victims at one point and how the crime hit home given his roots. He holds an annual basketball camp there and has pledged $1 million toward scholarships for under-served and minority students in the Charleston area, establishing \"The Middleton Scholars\" program. Middleton averages 19.8 points per game for the Bucks.\n\nTourney trip: Fifth (last in 1999). Tourney record: 1-4. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Grant Riller, 18.7 ppg. Best name: Osinachi Smart\n\n(6) TCU – The Ginger and the Rose. Do you ever hold grudges against programs that eliminate your team from the NCAA Tournament? TCU hasn't been there since the last time the tournament lacked a Wisconsin team (1998), so that's not the problem, but the Horned Frogs certainly dealt the Wisconsin football program a blow in the 2011 Rose Bowl, a 21-19 win for TCU. Led by Rose Bowl MVPs Andy Dalton and Tank Carder, TCU prevailed when Wisconsin failed a 2-point conversion with 2 minutes to play. It was JJ Watt's final game in a Badgers uniform.\n\nTourney trip: Eighth (last in 1998). Tourney record: 5-7. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Vladimir Brodziansky, 15.1 ppg. Best name: RJ Nembhard\n\n(11) ARIZONA STATE – Wulk this way. Ned Wulk, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Arizona State from 1958 to 1982, was born in Marion, Wisconsin, in Shawano County and graduated from what is now UW-La Crosse. He won 60 percent of his games at ASU, and the Wells Fargo Arena’s basketball floor has been named after him since 1999. When he won his 400th game, he was one of only four active coaches at the time with that many wins, and he posted 17 winning seasons in 25 years. It’s Arizona State’s first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2014, when it lost a gut-wrenching game at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee against Texas on a buzzer beater by Cameron Ridley, 87-85.\n\nTourney trip: 15th (last in 2014). Tourney record: 13-15. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Tra Holder, 18.6 ppg. Best name: Zylan Cheatham\n\n(11) SYRACUSE – Faces on TV. If there's one thing Syracuse is known for, it's media personalities (usually because they talk about Syracuse nonstop). Wisconsin has its share of Syracuse products. In sports broadcasting, the best known is probably Madison Memorial graduate Dave Pasch, who is the play-by-play broadcaster for the Arizona Cardinals football team but is probably best known as the basketball play-by-play man in charge of babysitting Bill Walton during Pac-12 basketball broadcasts on ESPN. Contessa Brewer, a former anchor at WTMJ in Milwaukee, went on to host \"Caught on Camera\" on MSNBC.\n\nTourney trip: 39th (last in 2016). Tourney record: 65-38. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 2013 Elite 8, 55-39; Defeated Wisconsin in 2012 Sweet 16, 64-63; Lost to Marquette in 2011 second round, 66-62; Defeated UW-Green Bay in 1994 second round, 64-59. Leading scorer: Tyus Battle 19.8 ppg. Best name: Marek Dolezaj\n\n(3) MICHIGAN STATE – A connection at La Lumiere. Freshman Jaren Jackson Jr., an Indianapolis native who came to the program from La Lumiere prep school in Indiana, won the Dick's Sporting Goods national championship for high-school programs of that sort, and his teammate was future Michigan rival Jordan Poole. Poole spent three years at Milwaukee King before transferring to La Lumiere as a senior. Jackson has been a regular starter and a big reason why the Spartans have been one of the nation's best teams.\n\nTourney trip: 32nd (21 straight years). Tourney record: 64-30. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 2007 first round, 61-49; Defeated Wisconsin in 2000 Final Four, 53-41; Defeated UW-Green Bay in 1991 first round, 60-58; Defeated Marquette in 1959 Sweet 16, 74-69. Leading scorer: Miles Bridges, 16.9 ppg. Best name: Lourawls \"Tum Tum\" Nairn Jr.\n\n(14) BUCKNELL – Bucky dances after all. While Bucky Badger is the beloved mascot of the Wisconsin sports programs, Bucknell's Bison also goes by the name Bucky. The Bison was selected as the school's mascot as a nod to its location in the Buffalo Valley of Central Pennsylvania. Bucky Badger has a much larger profile as a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame (inducted in 2006). Buckingham U. Badger first appeared on the scene in 1948. Current Bucknell head coach Nathan Davis took the job in 2015 from Dave Paulsen, now the head coach at George Mason. Paulsen graduated from Wausau East High School.\n\nTourney trip: Eighth (two straight years). Tourney record: 2-7. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2005 second round, 71-62. Leading scorer: Zach Thomas, 20.7 ppg. Best name: Nana Foulland\n\n(7) RHODE ISLAND – Jarvis Garrett. Garrett spent three seasons playing at West Allis Central High School, then relocated to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, to pay for Notre Dame Prep. He averaged 24.0 points and 5.0 rebounds, with 7.0 assists and 3.0 steals per game there, and now he's a senior for the Rams. Some may remember he was fitted for a mask two years ago after a facial injury. He's a solid shooter (leading the team in 3-point percentage) who primarily comes off the bench. Last year, the Rams reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1999, and this year they're headed back.\n\nTourney trip: 10th (two straight years). Tourney record: 7-9. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Jared Terrell, 17.5 ppg. Best name: Cyril Langevine\n\n(10) OKLAHOMA– The former first lady of Wisconsin sports. Perhaps she's not universally beloved by all Wisconsin sports fans, but Olivia Munn was the first lady of state sports as the girlfriend of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers before they split (and Rodgers started dating NASCAR driver Danica Patrick). The Oklahoma native graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in journalism and began her post-college career as a sideline reporter, but she eventually moved to acting and landed roles on Comedy Central comedy show “The Daily Show,” HBO show “The Newsroom” and ”X-Men: Apocalypse.” Furthermore, Oklahoma is also the home to former Racine Prairie girls basketball standout Gabbi Ortiz, now in her senior year with the women's squad. Also, Oklahoma made it to the Sweet 16 as a 13th seed in 1999 after playing two games in Milwaukee, with Ryan Humphrey's tip-in at the buzzer thwarting Arizona. One more connection: Benjamin Coldagelli, the basketball contact in the OU media relations office, hails from New Berlin.\n\n\n\nTourney trip: 31st (last in 2016). Tourney record: 41-30. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2006 first round, 82-74. Leading scorer: Trae Young, 27.5 ppg. Best name: Kameron McGusty\n\n(2) DUKE – Wojo. Marquette couldn't quite break through to the NCAA Tournament for a second straight year, but the Golden Eagles showed flashes of excellence this year under coach Steve Wojciechowski, whose connections to Duke run deep. Wojo was a point guard at Duke from 1994 to 1998, then an assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski before joining the Golden Eagles in 2014. Top Marquette assistant Chris Carrawell graduated from Duke in 2000 and also was a top player in the program.\n\nTourney trip: 42nd (23 straight years). Tourney record: 108-36. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Wisconsin in 2015 National Championship Game, 68-63; Defeated Marquette in 1994 Sweet 16, 59-49. Leading scorer: Marvin Bagley III, 21.1 ppg. Best name: Javin DeLaurier\n\n(15) IONA – Dance dance. The Chicago-based rock band Fall Out Boy filmed the video for its second major hit, \"Dance Dance\" in the high-school gymnasium at Salesian High School in New Rochelle, New York, which also happens to be the home of Iona College. \"Dance Dance\" was released in November 2005 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band's drummer, Andy Hurley, was born in Menomonee Falls and attended Menomonee Falls High School.\n\nTourney trip: 13th (three straight years). Tourney record: 1-12. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Rickey McGill, 13.7 ppg. Best name: Jan Svandrlik\n\nWest region\n\n(1) XAVIER – Kerem Kanter. Most people know the Xavier 6-10 forward as the brother of NBA player Enes Kanter, but Wisconsinsites also know him as a former member of the UW-Green Bay men's basketball team. He was the second-leading scorer on the squad last year and leading rebounder (11.3 points, 6.3 rebounds) before graduating and moving to Cincinnati for his final year of eligibility. He comes off the bench for the Musketeers but ranks third on the team in scoring (10.8 per game).\n\nTourney trip: 28th (five straight years). Tourney record: 27-27. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2016 second round, 66-63; Lost to Marquette in 2011 first round, 66-55; Defeated Wisconsin in 2009 second round, 60-49. Leading scorer: Trevon Bluiett, 19.7 ppg. Best name: Trevon Bluiett\n\n(16) NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL – Transfer ties. NC Central relies heavily on transfers; almost everyone on the roster started his career at another college or a JUCO. The Eagles have had some Wisconsin players who've passed through in the past couple years, including former Wisconsin Mr. Basketball Nimrod Hilliard, who transferred from Lamar, and Jamal Ferguson, a Virginian who began his career at Marquette.\n\nTourney trip: Third (two straight years). Tourney record: 0-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Raasean Davis, 15.3 ppg. Best name: Raekwon Harney\n\n(16) TEXAS SOUTHERN – Demontrae Jefferson. Jefferson, a Milwaukee native, played six games as a freshman for Milwaukee Hamilton and averaged 18 points per game, but he didn't suit up in the Badger State thereafter, making his name at Believe Prep Academy in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The diminutive guard leads the team in scoring at 23.7 points per game despite his 5-7 frame, and he became a bit of a buzzworthy sensation on the AAU circuit.\n\nTourney trip: Eighth (two straight years). Tourney record: 0-7. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Demontrae Jefferson, 23.7 ppg. Best name: Marquis Salmon\n\n(8) MISSOURI – We Want Wolf. He doesn't see the floor all that much, but junior Adam Wolf hails from Beaver Dam, where he averaged 17.0 points as a senior and helped his team to a 19-win season as a senior. In December, Missouri fans chanted \"We Want Wolf\" in the final minutes of a game, begging coach Cuonzo Martin to put the popular 6-7 walk-on into the game. Wolf's father, John, was a walk-on at Marquette for two years in the 1980s. Missouri, by the way, has had pretty good success against Wisconsin teams (3-1) in the NCAA Tournament. Also, they're in the same state as the St. Louis Cardinals. Boo to the Tigers.\n\nTourney trip: 27th (last in 2013). Tourney record: 22-26. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 2009 second round, 83-79; Lost to Marquette in 2003 second round, 101-92 in overtime; Defeated Wisconsin in 1994 second round, 109-96; Defeated Marquette in 1982 second round, 73-69. Leading scorer: Kassius Robertson, 16.2 ppg. Best name: Reed Nikko\n\n(9) FLORIDA STATE – Dennis Gates. The assistant coach started his career at Marquette, serving on the staff under Tom Crean in 2003-04, the year after the program reached the Final Four. He's in his seventh year with the Seminoles now. When Gates was at Northern Illinois in 2008-09, he was one of the youngest associate head coaches in the country at age 28.\n\nTourney trip: 16th (two straight years). Tourney record: 16-15. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2009 first round, 61-59. Leading scorer: Terance Mann, 13.3 ppg. Best name: (tie) Mfiondu Kabengele and Christ Koumadje\n\n(5) OHIO STATE – Nigel's rival. In 2012, Whitmer High School of Toledo, including future Badgers standout Nigel Hayes, faced off with Pickerington Central in the Ohio High School Athletic Association state semifinal and fell, 45-40. One of the top players on Pickerington was Jae'Sean Tate, then a sophomore, and the squad went on to win the state title. Tate went on to be second-team All-Ohio as a junior (Hayes was named first team that same year). Today, Tate is the team's second-leading scorer and has started every game for a surprising Buckeyes team. Ohio State assistant coach Scoonie Penn was a famous one-half of a dynamite backcourt in the late 1990s, teaming with future Milwaukee Bucks star Michael Redd and leading OSU to the 1999 Final Four.\n\nTourney trip: 32nd (last in 2015). Tourney record: 55-30. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 1971 second round, 60-59. Leading scorer: Keita Bates-Diop, 19.4 ppg. Best name: Keita Bates-Diop\n\n(12) SOUTH DAKOTA STATE – Just about everyone here is from Wisconsin. The big connection is coach TJ Otzelberger, a St. Thomas More graduate who was a three-year starter at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. He also coached high-school hoops in the state at Burlington Catholic Central before beginning his college coaching career. The connections are numerous from there. Those on the roster include Chris Howell, a Milwaukee King product who attended Butler Community College; Brandon Key, formerly of West Allis Central and Southwest Tennessee State; Tevin King, who finished his prep career at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Delafield; and a trio of redshirting freshmen are from the state, including Alex Arians (Madison Edgewood), Alou Dillon (Wauwatosa West) and Ryan Krueger (Hortonville). Assistant coach Eric Henderson coached at Catholic Central in Burlington, and fellow assistant Ben Walker was a star at Oak Creek High School.\n\nTourney trip: Fifth (three straight years). Tourney record: 0-4. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Mike Daum, 23.8 ppg. Best name: Skyler Flatten\n\n(4) GONZAGA – The Gray Ghost of Gonzaga. You might be surprised that Gonzaga has any football connections to anywhere, since the school discontinued offering football after World War II. But one of two Hall of Fame football players to attend Gonzaga is the former Packers great Tony Canadeo, who was nicknamed the Gray Ghost of Gonzaga during his time on the West Coast. He became just the third player in league history to clear 1,000 yards in 1949 and retired as the all-time rushing leader in Packers history (he's still fourth). His No. 3 is on the facade at Lambeau Field, and he became a Pro Football Hall of Famer in 1974.\n\nTourney trip: 21st (20 straight years). Tourney record: 29-20. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Johnathan Williams, 13.5 ppg. Best name: Killian Tillie\n\n(13) NORTH CAROLINA-GREENSBORO – Justin Jordan. Aside from the unshakable distinction as Michael Jordan's nephew (sorry, Justin), the UNC-Greensboro senior also started his career at UW-Milwaukee and stayed two seasons before transferring. He played 34 games with the Panthers — 30 as a freshman and four in an abbreviated sophomore year before making the switch — and that included 15 starts. He was even named Horizon League Freshman of the Week at one point. He sees just less than 9 minutes a game for Greensboro.\n\nTourney trip: Third (last in 2001). Tourney record: 0-2. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Francis Alonso, 15.6 ppg. Best name: Jack Konstanzer\n\n(6) HOUSTON – Kelvin Sampson. Houston head coach Kelvin Sampson has had a long college coaching career (albeit one mired in controversy after he was hit with NCAA recruiting violations), but he did spend time as an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks as an assistant from 2008-11, which included Milwaukee's 2009-10 \"Fear the Deer\" season. At Houston, he's gotten the Cougars back to the NCAA Tournament for the second time since 1992. In the offseason, he played a huge role in Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, gathering clothing and other gear for local schools. University of Wisconsin alumnus JJ Watt also became celebrated for his post-Harvey fundraising.\n\nTourney trip: 20th (last in 2010). Tourney record: 26-24. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 1961 first round, 77-61. Leading scorer: Rob Gray, 18.6 ppg. Best name: Caleb Broodo\n\n(11) SAN DIEGO STATE – Who really owns the record? San Diego State running back Donnel Pumphrey is the all-time NCAA career rushing leader, having surpassed Wisconsin's Ron Dayne in the 2016 Las Vegas Bowl to close his career and finishing with 6,405 yards to edge Dayne's official tally of 6,397. But is it REALLY the record? Before 2002, the NCAA did not count bowl games in career rushing totals, so Pumphrey had the benefit of racking up yards that Dayne didn't get to count — and the NCAA refuses to retroactively adjust its record book and add those rushing totals. Dayne's 7,125 yards would still be king, otherwise.\n\nTourney trip: 12th (last in 2015). Tourney record: 6-11. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Malik Pope, 12.8 ppg. Best name: Max Montana\n\n(3) MICHIGAN – Jordan Poole. Coming off the bench for the Wolverines and scoring six points per game is a former first-team All State choice in Wisconsin in 2016 when Poole played at Milwaukee King. He spent his senior year at La Lumiere School in Indiana before arriving in Ann Arbor. At King, he reached the state tournament in 2014 and won back-to-back City Conference championships. The parents of celebrated Michigan football coach, Jim Harbaugh, live in Mequon.\n\nTourney trip: 28th (three straight years). Tourney record: 53-26. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Marquette in 1974 Elite 8, 72-70. Leading scorer: Mo Wagner 14.5 ppg. Best name: Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman\n\n(14) MONTANA – Larry Krystkowiak. The native of Missoula, Montana, and college basketball player at his hometown University of Montana was named Big Sky Conference MVP three times, then went on to an NBA career that included the majority of his career with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1987-92. He ultimately became a Bucks assistant coach and then head coach in 2007-08 before he was fired and returned to the college ranks. Today, he's head coach at Utah.\n\nTourney trip: 11th (last in 2013). Tourney record: 2-11. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2012 first round, 73-49. Leading scorer: Ahmaad Rorie, 17.2 ppg. Best name: Fabijan Krslovic\n\n(7) TEXAS A&M – Duane Wilson. After spending four years in the Marquette University program, former Dominican High School standout Duane Wilson graduated and transferred for his final year of eligibility with the Aggies, and he was a key factor for the squad before suffering a knee injury on Feb. 10 that cost the rest of his season. Wilson, who won two state titles at Dominican, made a free throw with 3.5 seconds left to beat No. 8 Auburn just a few days earlier, 81-80.\n\nTourney trip: 14th (last in 2016). Tourney record: 11-14. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated UW-Green Bay in 2016 first round, 92-65. Leading scorer: Tyler Davis, 14.7 ppg. Best name: DJ Hogg\n\n(10) PROVIDENCE – Good luck charm. Big East foe Providence had never won at Marquette until last season in a 79-78 thriller. During the game, coach Ed Cooley connected with a boy in the crowd from Sussex, Bobby Horner, and the now-11-year-old became his team's \"good luck charm.\" On Feb. 3, 2018, the Friars won at Marquette again, 77-75, and Cooley brought the boy back to the locker room to celebrate with the team. Needless to say, Horner is now a Providence fan for life.\n\nTourney trip: 20th (five straight years). Tourney record: 15-20. Facing Wisconsin teams: Defeated Marquette in 1997 first round, 81-59. Leading scorer: Rodney Bullock, 14.9 ppg. Best name: Dajour Dickens\n\n(2) NORTH CAROLINA – Diamond Dandies. Only once in Milwaukee Brewers history has the franchise held the No. 1 pick in the annual amateur draft, and in 1995, the Brewers went with a catcher from the University of North Carolina named BJ Surhoff. Surhoff spent nine seasons with the Brewers and hit .274 (batting average was still a thing then) with 57 homers and 524 RBIs. Sadly, he fared much better in the subsequent eight years as a Baltimore Oriole, but whatever. If he was the UNC baseball import, then current Franklin High School standout Max Alba is the export. Alba was recruited to pitch at UNC next year (presumably if he doesn't get drafted in an early round himself this summer). You can watch Alba pitch for the Franklin High School team for the first time in 2018, the final year Franklin will play summer baseball.\n\nTourney trip: 49th (eight straight years). Tourney record: 123-45. Facing Wisconsin teams: Lost to Wisconsin in 2015 Sweet 16, 79-72; Defeated Marquette in 2011 Sweet 16, 81-63; Defeated Wisconsin in 2005 Elite 8, 88-82; Lost to Marquette in 1977 National Championship, 67-59. Leading scorer: Luke Maye, 17.2 ppg. Best name: Seventh Woods\n\n(15) LIPSCOMB – Milhockey. Lipscomb is located in Nashville, Tennessee, home of the NHL's Nashville Predators, a franchise that has been affiliated with the Milwaukee Admirals since the Predators were founded in 1998. Many of the franchise's most familiar names — goalie Pekka Rinne, five-time All Star Shea Weber, three-time All Star Kimmo Timonen and all-time scoring leader David Legwand among them — have at least spent brief visits in Milwaukee.\n\nTourney trip: First ever. Tourney record: 0-0. Facing Wisconsin teams: Never. Leading scorer: Garrison Mathews, 21.7 ppg. Best name: Aaron Korn\n\nNIT top seeds\n\nBAYLOR – Black bears. Baylor’s mascot is the American Black Bear, with Bruiser the name given to the costumed creature. Baylor is also home to two actual black bears, Joy and Lady, though rules keep them from attending sporting events on a regular basis. Wisconsin’s black bear population has blossomed in the past 20 years to anywhere between 20,000 and 25,000 bears, according to the DNR, and hunting permits for black bears in the state have increased as a result.\n\nLeading scorer: Manu Lecomte, 16.0 ppg. Best name: Jo Lual-Acuil Jr.\n\nNOTRE DAME – Arike Ogunbowale. In her junior season as a member of the Fighting Irish women’s basketball team, Divine Savior Holy Angels product (and former McDonald’s All-American) Arike Ogunbowale has quite simply been one of the best players in the nation for the 26-2 Irish. She started all 28 games in the regular season for Notre Dame, shooting 45 percent from the floor and averaging 20.3 points and 5.4 rebounds, not to mention 76 assists and 45 steals.\n\nLeading scorer: Matt Farrell, 16.8 ppg. Best name: Nikola Djogo\n\nSAINT MARY'S – This is not Detroit, man, this is the Super Bowl. Among the alumni from the California-based university are NFL referee Pete Morelli, who oversaw perhaps the greatest moment of schadenfreude in Wisconsin sports fan history. He was head referee in the 2010 NFC Championship Game featuring the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints, when former Packers iconic quarterback Brett Favre threw a late interception that short-circuited Minnesota’s chances of getting to the Super Bowl (leading to the much-beloved Paul Allen call on Minnesota radio). Mike Pereira, now with Fox but then the NFL Supervisor of Officials, admitted a penalty flag should have been thrown on a Saints hit against Favre that led to an earlier interception. It became one of many examples of the famous Saints “Bountygate” scandal.\n\nLeading scorer: Jock Londale, 21.4 ppg. Best name: Kristers Zoriks\n\nSOUTHERN CAL – We're in the movies! Before Ron Howard won two Academy Awards for producing and directing \"A Beautiful Mind,\" the USC graduate starred in \"Happy Days\" for six years. The sitcom, set in Milwaukee, ran for 11 seasons. Since leaving the show in 1980, Howard has directed such films as \"Cocoon,\" \"Apollo 13,\" \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"Frost/Nixon.\" \"Apollo 13,\" of course, told the story of three astronauts on a failed mission to the moon, with Tom Hanks portraying James Lovell, who grew up in Milwaukee and graduated from the University of Wisconsin. USC was also on the losing end of the famous \"Miracle in Milwaukee\" when Georgia Tech won a buzzer beater in the second round of the 1992 NCAA Tournament.\n\nLeading scorer: Chimezie Metu, 15.3 ppg. Best name: Chimezie Metu\n\nSconnies at the Dance\n\n*Redshirting this season after transfer into program\n\n^ Plalyed briefly as a freshman at Milwaukee Hamilton; played bulk of prep career at South Carolina academy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/03/ballet-for-seniors-dr-fauci-boblehead-patrots-plane-ferries-95-masks-news-from-around-our-50-states/2938509001/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/06/01/corridor-death-jumping-worms-dolphin-danger-news-around-states/50310719/", "title": "'Corridor of death', jumping worms: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: In what’s being touted as a major victory for clean water advocates, a Birmingham-based coal company has agreed to meet environmentalists’ demands and clean up an abandoned mine site on the Locust Fork tributary of the Black Warrior River. A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}]}

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service gave it the designation, giving the state of North Carolina 11 national wildlife refuge areas in all, mostly on the coast.\n\nThe first National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt to protect the brown pelican breeding grounds in Florida. With the creation of Mountain Bogs, the system has 563 refuges, protecting more than 150 million acres nationwide.\n\nMountain Bogs National Wildlife Refuge, which will be devoted to the conservation of Southern Appalachian mountain bogs, one of the rarest and most imperiled habitats in the United States, is the first North Carolina refuge west of Charlotte.\n\n\"The establishment of Mountain Bogs National Wildlife Refuge marks a turning point in the efforts of a number of dedicated partners in preserving this unique and threatened habitat,\" said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Director Jim Kurth, who visited the new site Wednesday.\n\n\"It will provide a focal point for mountain bog conservation in the area, and highlights the importance of our National Wildlife Refuge system in preserving our nation's spectacular biodiversity for future generations of Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhile North Carolina is brimming with public lands in national parks such as the Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountains, managed for activities such as public recreation and cultural resources, and national forests such as the Pisgah and Nantahala, managed for timber and other uses, WNC has never had its own National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\"National Wildlife Refuges are public federal lands like national forests and national parks but with a couple of differences,\" said Gary Peeples, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Asheville Field Office. \"The great distinction on National Wildlife Refuges is that wildlife comes first. They are managed and conserved for the well-being of plants and animals on site. They are all about wildlife conservation.\"\n\nThe idea for a refuge to protect mountain bogs had been in the works for decades, Peeples said. It finally came to fruition with help from The Nature Conservancy, which donated the easement to the land.\n\nThe land trust acquired the land, which was once a gravel mine, in the early 2000s, said Adam Warwick, stewardship for the Nature Conservancy.\n\n\"A Nature Conservancy employee at the time stumbled across that site and made the discovery of the mountain bog turtle, a federally threatened species,\" he said. \"We quickly worked to acquire that property. We've discovered close to 80 bog turtles. It's a really superb habitat. Over years we've had problems with non-native invasive species, but we've managed it with goat grazing and herbicides and manual removal as well.\"\n\nMountain bogs are typically small and widely scattered across the landscape, often isolated from other wetlands. They are important to wildlife and plants, as well as to humans. They have a natural capacity for regulating water flow, holding floodwaters like giant sponges and slowly releasing water to nearby streams decreasing the impacts of floods and droughts.\n\n\"One of the key motivators for us in creating the Mountain Bogs National Wildlife Refuge is to help the conservation of a handful of species that depend on this type of habitat,\" Peeples said.\n\nMountain Bogs NWR is home to five endangered species — bog turtles, mountain sweet pitcher plant, green pitcher plant, Swamp pink (a lily) and bunched arrowhead. Bogs are breeding habitat for many species of amphibians, especially salamanders, of which the Southern Appalachians have the greatest diversity in the nation. They also provide habitat for migratory birds and game animals, including mink, woodcock, ruffed grouse, turkey and wood duck.\n\nThe refuge is authorized to grow up to 23,000 acres, Peeples said, depending on the availability of lands, and funds to purchase those lands. The Fish and Wildlife Service has identified 30 sites, or Conservation Partnership Areas, containing bogs and surrounding lands scattered across Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Clay, Graham, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Transylvania, Wilkes and Watauga counties in North Carolina, and Carter and Johnson counties in Tennessee. Unlike a large national park or national forest, the national wildlife refuge would comprise smaller, non-adjacent properties.\n\n\"Southern Appalachian bogs are biodiversity hotspots,\" said Kieran Roe, executive director at Carolina Mountain Land Conservancy, which has been active in helping to establishing the new refuge. \"But they are disappearing from our region at a rapid rate. Less than 20 percent of the mountain bogs that once existed still remain, so their protection is critical.\"\n\nThere are clusters of mountain bogs around Western North Carolina, many in Henderson and Transylvania counties, the region just south of Asheville, blessed with the French Broad River moving through it at a slower pace and on a flatter course than the river north of Asheville. That makes it more conducive for bogs, Roe said.\n\n\"Most of our mountain rivers and streams are high-gradient, but the French Broad upstream of Buck Shoals is fairly slow-moving and flat and has floodplain areas. A lot of the bogs are found in those areas,\" he said.\n\nThe conservancy worked to protect the Oklawaha Bog, a 30-acre area near Flat Rock, by restoring the area that was dredged and drained for residential use and now is a mountain bog, home to the endangered bunched arrowhead, which Roe said is found only in Henderson County and in Greenville County, S.C., and 10 other sites in the world.\n\nThe Mountain Bogs refuge is about a 2 1/2-hour drive from the Asheville area. Roe said many partners are working with wildlife officials and landowners to include more WNC properties int the Mountain Bogs NWR.\n\nPeeples said the new refuge is being managed by Fish and Wildlife staff in Georgia, with help from the endangered species biologist from the Asheville Field Office. As the refuge grows, he said, the agency will look at dedicating more staff.\n\nRight now, there is no public access to Mountain Bogs.\n\n\"We are hopeful we will eventually be able to provide public recreation opportunities. Wildlife-based recreation comes first,\" he said.\n\nWhile parts of the refuge are most likely too sensitive for public recreation, the wildlife-related type of recreation that might be allowed are hunting, fishing, wildlife photography, wildlife watching, environmental education and interpretation.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service is looking at the areas within these Conservation Partnership Areas to acquire land and/or easements, and will work to support private landowners in conserving their land. Funding to acquire land and easements likely would come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, funded by offshore oil and gas drilling leases.\n\n\"Our ultimate goal is conserving mountain bogs,\" Peeples said. \"The Mountain Bogs National Wildlife Refuge is just the newest tool we have to reach that goal. Whether these bogs become part of the National Wildlife Refuge or are conserved by private landowners, we are happy either way.\"\n\n\"To me, creating a new national wildlife refuge is a pretty big deal,\" Roe said.\n\n\"Most people are familiar with refuges on coastal areas (such as Alligator River National WIldlife Refuge), which are often areas for breeding and habitat for migratory waterfowl,\" Roe said. \"It's much rarer to have those refuges in these upland mountain areas.\n\n\"Mountain bogs are very threatened, very endangered habitat for our part of the world. Having resources from the federal government to be a part of this now I hope will be a turnaround for mountain bogs, and we'll see more or them saved.\"\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFor more information, visit www.fws.gov/mountainbogs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2024/10/28/environmentalists-new-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta-water-plan-worse-than-trump-rules/75840484007/", "title": "Critics: New California Delta water plan worse than Trump's rules", "text": "Alastair Bland, CalMatters\n\nCalMatters\n\nWhen the Trump administration presented a new plan exporting more water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta five years ago, state officials and environmentalists objected that the new rules would increase the chances that salmon, smelt and steelhead would go extinct.\n\nNow, state and federal agencies are nearing the finish line on a replacement plan that could boost water supplies for cities and some growers but, according to a federal analysis, could be even more harmful to the estuary and its fish.\n\nThe Trump administration rules, critics say, fail to adequately protect endangered fish, while increasing Delta water exports to some Central Valley farms and Southern California cities.\n\nSmith Canal Gate Project: Stockton unveils new floodgate, the first of its kind west of the Mississippi\n\nBut the new proposal from the Biden and Newsom administrations — developed mostly by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of Water Resources — does not fix what environmentalists considered deal-breaking flaws in the Trump rules. Rather, they say, it worsens them, and could lead to lower survival and accelerated declines in fish listed as threatened or endangered.\n\n“You’d think it would be at least as good as the one the (state) sued over — but it’s not,” said Jon Rosenfield, science director at San Francisco Baykeeper and one of the lead voices of opposition. “Not only do the proposed operations make things no better (for fish in the San Francisco Bay-Delta), they actually make things worse.”\n\nWater districts serving growers and urban areas said they support the federal and state agencies’ preferred plan, even though some expect less water to be delivered to them. They said it is a carefully plotted roadmap for managing human water supply while also protecting Central Valley rivers and their fish.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Reclamation is planning to release its final environmental review of its options in mid-November, and then — in collaboration with state water officials — approve a plan for operating California’s two massive Delta water conveyance projects after a 30-day period, said David Mooney, manager of the agency’s Bay-Delta Office. Mooney told CalMatters that the final decision will be made “jointly” with the state.\n\nAt stake is a new operating arrangement for the State Water Project — which delivers Northern California river water to 27 million Californians, mostly in Southern California, and 750,000 acres of farmland — and the federal Central Valley Project, which serves 2.5 million people and 3 million acres of farmland. These systems together export 3 to 5 million acre-feet of water from the Delta each year, the equivalent of the amount used by 9 to 15 million households.\n\nAn environmental report released by the federal agency in July analyzed five options for implementing the plan. The preferred one — which was drafted after weekly meetings between six state and federal agencies — would likely harm threatened and endangered fish, according to the report.\n\n“The Proposed Action may affect, and is likely to adversely affect Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon,” as well as Delta smelt, spring-run Chinook, Central Valley steelhead, green sturgeon and longfin smelt, the agency reported in its biological assessment of the plan.\n\nState and federal officials say their new preferred option offers features that the Trump-era operating arrangement did not — including more protective temperature controls in the Sacramento River where salmon spawn, timed pulses of water in the spring to help young salmon reach the ocean, and boosted hatchery production. Special attention has been paid to spawning conditions for the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook, a federally listed endangered species.\n\n“Overall, we expect conditions for winter-run (Chinook) to be better,” said Mooney of the federal Bureau of Reclamation.\n\nHowever, when measured against a baseline of the 2019 Trump administration rules, the new operating plan could reduce numbers of young winter-run salmon swimming downstream by as much as 23% in critically dry years, according to the federal analysis. Even in wet years — generally good for salmon spawning success — it would cause a slight decline in young salmon. Environmentalists say this may be because the proposal lacks sufficient protections for the fish after they’re born, during their downstream migration through the Delta.\n\nThe state Department of Water Resources separately analyzed potential impacts of the State Water Project’s Delta facilities. Lenny Grimaldo, the project’s assistant environmental director, told CalMatters that the proposed operating plan “incorporates a portfolio of actions designed to reduce impacts to listed species while ensuring water supply reliability.”\n\nState water officials wrote in their report that even though the Delta has been degraded by many “past actions and activities,” the isolated effect of the proposed plan would be minimal.\n\nThe expected impacts of the plan vary with how wet the year has been. For example, it could – under certain conditions — cause more fish to get sucked into the state and federal pumping stations. This is an inevitable downside of the water projects that have killed many millions of fish.\n\n“If you operate water pumps, you are going to entrain some amount of fish, so the question is, what amount of fish is sustainable or is allowable without causing jeopardy to the population?” said Jennifer Pierre, general manager of the State Water Contractors, which represents urban water agencies and irrigation districts.\n\nFederal fish and wildlife officials must still decide whether their option brings any of the fish species closer to extinction — not just whether it harms some fish. That decision will come in two reports, called biological opinions, that are expected before the end of the year.\n\nJeffrey Kightlinger, former general manager of the urban water supplier Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said the Bureau of Reclamation’s proposed plan adequately identifies and mitigates impacts to salmon, smelt and other species. He said other environmental problems, including climate change, cause more harm to these fish in the first place.\n\n“This iteration of the plan is, to my mind, the best one we’ve had in the last 20-something years,” he said, explaining that it more evenly distributes regulatory constraints on pumping between the federal and state water projects than previous arrangements.\n\nOne unlikely option would slash water deliveries\n\nOf five options on the table, “Alternative 2” is endorsed by the Bureau of Reclamation, the state Department of Water Resources, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, federal fish and wildlife agencies and major agricultural water districts. It is dubbed the “Multi-Agency Consensus” alternative.\n\nAnother listed option is the so-called “No Action Alternative,” which would default to the current rules for operating the water systems stemming largely from the Trump administration in 2019. That’s an unlikely outcome, sources say.\n\nAnother was drafted with input from environmental organizations. It would drastically cut water exports from the Delta but would also, according to the federal modeling, dramatically improve environmental conditions in Central Valley rivers and increase each fish species’ survival and production.\n\n“This is the only alternative that adequately protects endangered species,” said Ashley Overhouse, water policy advisor for Defenders of Wildlife. “It also focuses on maintaining higher reservoir storage and higher flows into and out of the Delta.”\n\nThat option would cut average annual exports from the Central Valley Project to San Joaquin Valley growers by two-thirds – from 1 million acre-feet to 333,000 acre-feet per year. It would similarly slash State Water Project exports by about half.\n\nUrban and agricultural water user groups have endorsed the option preferred by the federal and state agencies.\n\nCompared to the Trump-era rules, it would increase State Water Project average annual deliveries — 1.9 million acre-feet under the Trump rules — by a sliver, to just under 2 million acre-feet, with no significant changes during drought periods. For some Central Valley Project farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, water deliveries could drop by up to 19% in drought years, according to the federal analysis. Cuts are less substantial in wetter years.\n\nStill, the water districts serving the growers said they are generally supportive.\n\nAt the Westlands Water District, which provides Central Valley Project water to San Joaquin Valley growers, average annual deliveries are expected to decline under the new plan’s preferred alternative. General Manager Allison Febbo said she expects a “significant decline in our water supply” but cannot predict “the full extent of the effects.” She attributes the cut partly to the proposed actions to help winter-run Chinook.\n\n“But we agree those fish are in critical condition and understand the need for that, though it does impact our water supply,” she said.\n\nFor the Sacramento River Settlement Contractors – a major Central Valley Project water recipient that grows much of the state’s rice – the proposed plan, compared to the Trump rules, would cut supplies 6% on average. In dry and critically dry years, the same group of farmers would be cut 10%, according to the federal analysis. Mooney said under certain conditions, their water deliveries could be cut in half from their total allocation.\n\nStill, they support it, said Thaddeus Bettner, the group’s executive director. He noted that five government agencies helped develop that proposal and “we want to support an action that has that level of support.”\n\nWater projects are ‘death by a thousand cuts’\n\nThe Department of Water Resources, in its review of proposed State Water Project operations, predicted large increases in young fall-run Chinook killed by the Delta pumps.\n\nFor example, deaths of young fish at the pumping station would nearly double, to almost 7,000 fish, in years with “below normal” rainfall. The fall-run Chinook is not subject to endangered species protections, but its low numbers in the past 15 years have led to a two-year closure of commercial and recreational fishing.\n\nCalifornia’s Delta is in crisis: Is state discriminating against people who fish there?\n\nBut Grimaldo, at the state water agency, said the entrapment of more fish will not amount to a significant hit to the total population. “Overall, the (State Water Project) entrains a very small proportion of the approximately 20-30 million juvenile hatchery fall-run salmon released annually in the Central Valley,” he said.\n\nWhile the federal review proposes actions to help the fish and offset expected impacts, the state’s environmental review, anticipating insignificant impacts, does not.\n\nPierre, with State Water Contractors, added that the purpose of the environmental review process is not to avoid all “take” of a species — it’s to authorize “take.” Take is the technical term for disturbing, harming or killing a protected species.\n\nBut several of these species are already close to extinction, and even slight harm at this point may be cause for concern.\n\n“The water projects are a death by a thousand cuts, and can we tell which of those cuts is having the greatest impact?” said Carson Jeffres, a fish biologist with the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences. “Small changes in the (long-term operation of the water projects) won’t be a death knell, but they might just be another cut.”\n\nJeffres said climate change and invasive species are also responsible for the downfall of the Delta ecosystem, amplifying the impacts of dams, habitat loss, reduced flows and pumping stations.\n\nEnvironmental advocates said the time has come for a major regime shift in how water is divided between user groups. Barry Nelson, a policy representative for the Golden State Salmon Association, said the federal Bureau of Reclamation dismissed the more fish-friendly alternative “out of hand.”\n\n“How you can fix a system that is careening toward multiple extinctions without significantly changing the status quo is beyond me,” Nelson said.\n\nChris Shutes, the executive director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, also thinks the time has come for the agricultural industry to release its legal entitlement to so much water or at least take bigger cuts in dry times.\n\n“The water contracts need to be renegotiated,” he said, referring to long-term delivery agreements made decades ago between government agencies and farming districts. “They need to look at how to reset the system so that agriculture can remain sustainable but perhaps at a different level than it is now.”\n\nThe revision of the Central Valley’s water management system comes in the midst of an ecological meltdown in the Bay-Delta, which is California’s largest estuary. All Chinook salmon populations have crashed and salmon fishing has been banned statewide for two years.\n\nDelta smelt, once a common species, are now nearly extinct. The small, silvery fish only lives in the Delta, and it’s long been a potent figure in California’s water wars.\n\nLongfin smelt numbers have nosedived precipitously from historic abundance. Managed as a threatened species by the state for 15 years, it was listed in July as federally endangered, and it appears to be following in the path of its cousin the tiny Delta smelt.\n\nReckoning with yet another declining species, California is now evaluating whether the white sturgeon, once abundant, should be listed as threatened.\n\nUC Davis’ Jeffres said more fish are on track to vanish without major changes to water management. California must, he said, increase river flows at key times of year while aggressively rebuilding wetlands and floodplains. He said efforts to restore flows have amounted to “messing around at the edges without doing anything at scale” to boost fish populations.\n\n“Unless we start thinking outside the box,” he warned, “our salmon will follow the smelt” into extinction.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/americas/maralliance-mesoamerican-reef-c2e-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "A shark 'superhighway' is being protected by fishermen | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was identified by Patricia Zurita, who is guest editor for Call to Earth’s “Nature’s Highways” theme.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor sharks, turtles and rays in the Caribbean, the Mesoamerican Reef – which spans more than 600 miles from Mexico to Honduras – is a busy highway. As the second-largest barrier reef in the world, marine species use it to navigate north and south, and its rich tapestry of coral, seagrass and mangrove forests provide vital food and habitat.\n\nBut as with highways on land, this marine corridor can be dangerous. Overfishing, commercial development and the illegal practice of finning is endangering species such as whale sharks, reef sharks and manta rays. These creatures are already in a fragile state, with more than a third of sharks and rays threatened with extinction worldwide.\n\n“We’re seeing a continued decline of many sharks and shark populations in most countries where there is monitoring taking place,” says Rachel Graham, founder of MarAlliance, a non-profit focused on protecting sharks and rays throughout the Americas. “Our goal is to reverse that decline,” she adds.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why fishing communities in Belize are defending sharks 03:38 - Source: CNN Why fishing communities in Belize are defending sharks 03:38\n\nBy monitoring threatened marine life in the region, MarAlliance is able to glean important knowledge on populations that can help to inform conservation and push for political action. But rather than acting in opposition to the local fishing community, the NGO enlists their help.\n\n“They are the ones who are on the sea every single day,” says Graham, “and they are the ones who are going to decide the long-term fate of sharks and of fish.”\n\nFishers turned conservationists\n\nMarAlliance employs up to 60 fishers across its range, mostly on a project basis, training them to collect data and tag and release fish. Not only does this provide an alternative income to fishing communities, making them less dependent on natural resources, but it also teaches them about the benefits of a healthy ocean ecosystem and how to fish sustainably.\n\nRelated: Ocean photographer Shawn Heinrichs wants to save the seas\n\nIvan Torres is one of these fishers. Before working for MarAlliance, he says he used to catch sharks to sell locally as food, but now he has learned how they are critical to the health of the whole ecosystem. As apex predators they help to keep other populations in check, and by maintaining a balance they can actually increase the daily catch for fishers.\n\n“I would never fish sharks anymore … because now I know how important they are for the sea,” he says.\n\nCarribean reef sharks are listed as endangered by the IUCN due to threats from fishing and habitat loss. Rick Miskiv/MarAlliance\n\nIf this change in attitude continues to spread throughout fishing communities along the Mesoamerican Reef, Graham has hope for populations of sharks and other species.\n\n“The primary threat to sharks is unquestionably overfishing,” she says, and by reforming the industry, populations can bounce back.\n\nIn 2020, Belize outlawed the use of gillnets, large panels of netting that hang in the water and are known for entangling large marine animals. The ban’s impact is already noticeable in areas such as Lighthouse Reef, an atoll off the mainland, says Graham.\n\nIt was an area suffering from overfishing, with some boats crossing international waters to exploit its resources. But between 2019 and 2021, MarAlliance recorded a 10-fold increase in shark populations at the atoll. “What we’re seeing is nothing less than miraculous,” she says.\n\nBut these sorts of regulations need to be replicated along the whole superhighway for long-lasting impact, and countries need to find a sustainable balance between fishers and the fished.\n\nGraham hopes that through education and providing an economic alternative for fishing communities, MarAlliance will help to ensure safe passage for megafauna along the reef.\n\n“We need to find that win-win strategy between fisher livelihoods and shark survival,” she says.", "authors": ["Written Nell Lewis", "Video Stefanie Blendis"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2023/06/06/stranglehold-7-deadly-species-that-could-get-a-foothold-in-florida/70196789007/", "title": "7 deadly exotic species that could get a foothold in Florida", "text": "If it was just Burmese pythons, that would be bad enough.\n\nBut Florida is crawling with invasive animals: Sambar deer on St. Vincent Island, rhesus macaques in Ocala, Nile monitors in Cape Coral, Vervet monkeys near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and thousands of monk parakeets throughout the state.\n\nAMAZING VIDEOS: Watch the best python videos from our archives.\n\nThey get here in a variety of ways: Smugglers.

A 2016 scientific report confirmed that Nile crocodiles had been found living wild in south Florida and that they could become established in the state.\n\nIn 1996 or 1997, a young crocodile escaped from its enclosure at Billie Swamp Safari in Hendry County. When it was recaptured in 2000 it measured 9 feet. In April 2009, Robert Freer captured a second Nile crocodile from a porch of a home in Miami.\n\nA third, 4-foot crocodile was captured in October 2011 in Homestead. The fourth crocodile found in the wild was about 2 feet long when originally captured in March 2012 in a canal in Homestead. When the crocodile was recaptured in March 2014 in Everglades National Park it had grown to 5½ feet long.\n\nCrocodylus niloticus has several differences from American crocodiles. First, they can grow a bit larger. Male Nile crocodiles usually top out at 16.5 feet, about the same length as the largest American crocodiles, but some Nile crocodiles can grow to 20 feet long. Also, they live mainly in freshwater habitats, while American crocodiles generally prefer saltwater and live along the coast.\n\nBut what makes Nile crocodiles more of a threat is that they are more aggressive than American crocodiles, said Jim Beever, a Southwest Florida biologist and natural resources expert.\n\n\"American crocodiles are sweet by comparison,\" Beever said \"I don’t feel threatened by them.\" He said he's been in the water with them and they are much more interested in catching fish.\n\nThe Nile crocodile thinks everything is prey to them, he said.\n\n\"Alligators grab dogs walking by the water with their owners,\" he said. \"A Nile crocodile would take the dog and the owner.\"\n\nSaltwater crocodile\n\nThe saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile and, like the Nile crocodile, a killer of humans. It has the strongest bite of any animal on the planet.\n\nIt gets its name from its ability to tolerate salty water, but generally prefers coastal areas with brackish water. That often puts it in rivers and estuaries.\n\nThe natural range of Crocodylus porosus is enormous, stretching from India to Australia and many places between. And despite being called salties, they can tolerate brackish and freshwater.\n\nIf you find yourself in the water with a large saltie, it's a good bet you're considered prey.\n\nIn late April a 65-year-old man who was fishing at Kennedy Bend in northern Australia disappeared. His remains were soon found in two captured crocodiles, one 13.5 feet long, the other a 9-footer.\n\nPredator to prey: Fish and Wildlife Commission sets Burmese python hunt for 10 days in August; what we know\n\nBlack caiman\n\nBlack caimans (Melanosuchus niger) are the largest member of the family Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) and live in South America. They can reach 19.5 feet long and sometimes attack humans, but not with the frequency of Nile and saltwater crocodiles.\n\nThink they can't get established here? It's cousin, the spectacled caiman is already established here, due to escapes or releases, most likely due to the pet trade, says the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The spectacled caiman can reach 8 feet long but is generally only 6 feet long in Florida. It has been established with a breeding population in Broward and Dade counties for at least 10 years. That could be longer because they were first observed in Florida in the 1960s.\n\nLike the Nile crocodile, three additional crocodilians have been reported in Florida but haven't established a breeding population yet.\n\nBeever, the biologist, says invasive crocodilians would not necessarily have it easy while they are small. \"Something that’s similar to a creature we have here will still be preyed on,\" Beever said. For example, he said, great blue herons are used to eating baby alligators. They would just as easily eat a baby Nile crocodile.\n\nReticulated python\n\nThe reticulated python, Malayopython reticulatus, is the longest snake in the world, reaching lengths of 23 feet or more.\n\nIt has been reported in at least eight different areas of the state ranging from near Largo in Pinellas County to Dade County ‒ and in Broward and Dade counties it's been found in at least two different locations. In 2011 one was spotted off US 41 in Big Cypress National Preserve.\n\nReticulated pythons are native to Southeast Asia and can range from India to China and down to Indonesia. They are one of the few snake species known to prey on people.\n\nShealy's Skunk Ape Headquarters and Trail Lakes Campground in Ochopee have regulated snake exhibits that include Goldie, a reticulated python that is at least 20 feet long. \"Goldie is pretty tame, she has a good disposition but we keep her well fed so that's a big part of that,\" Jack Shealy said.\n\nShealy said reticulated pythons could get established if they are released in big enough numbers. He said a big part of the problem is pet owners who don't follow regulations.\n\n\"Over the years, South Florida has been a thriving ground for exotic species because of irresponsible pet owners, that's really what it comes down to,\" he said. \"People take fish, they take lizards, they get things that they think they want to have and then they just don't exhibit the responsibility and they get dumped off.\"\n\nGreen anaconda\n\nGreen anacondas, the world's heaviest snakes at more than 300 pounds, have have also been sighted in Florida, usually around central Florida. They have been reported as far north as Gainesville and as far south as Miami near Everglades City.\n\nClick this link to see where the species has been reported in Florida.\n\nFor example, one was found sunning itself outside a house's shed just north of Melbourne in 2016. It was 8.5 feet long.\n\nIn 2010, Osceola County deputies captured a 12-foot green anaconda at East Lake Fish Camp in northern Osceola. In 2004, a juvenile male was found in Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.\n\nEunectes murinus is an apex predator from South America capable of taking large prey in the same way Burmese pythons do. The FWC says seven green anacondas have been removed from Florida by the agency or its partners as of October 2020. It also says the state's climate is highly suitable for the species to get a foothold, although it is not yet established here.\n\nBesides the Burmese python, two other constrictors already have become established in Florida: the red-tailed boa and the Northern African python.\n\nBlack mamba\n\nThe black mamba is the second longest venomous snake in the world, and its venom can kill humans in three to 16 hours if they are not treated with antivenom.\n\nCould they get established here?\n\nIn January, FWC's Division of Law Enforcement (DLE) filed charges against eight people in connection with illegal trafficking of venomous and prohibited snakes.\n\nOver the course of the investigation, nearly 200 snakes, representing 24 species, were bought or sold by FWC undercover investigators. Some of those species include the inland taipan, bushmaster, rhinoceros viper, African bush viper, Gaboon viper, green mamba, eyelash viper, multiple species of spitting cobra, forest cobra, puff adder and saw-scaled vipers.\n\nThe people involved showed a complete disregard for the regulatory framework designed to keep Floridians safe, the agency said.\n\n“Some of these snakes are among the most dangerous in the world,” said Maj. Randy Bowlin, FWC DLE Investigations and Intelligence Section Leader, in a news release at the time.\n\nTask force members noted that the particular antivenom needed might not be in place if there's no reason to expect that species of snake to be nearby.\n\nWith mambas, though, you have to consider competitors, Beever said. \"The python thrived because there was nothing like it here.\"\n\nKing cobra\n\nIn 2017, a Monterery Park, California man was arrested on charges of smuggling three young king cobra snakes from Hong Kong in potato chip cannisters.\n\nThe King cobra, Ophiophagus hanna, is the largest venomous snake in the world. It can grow to 18 feet long, though it's usually about 8 to 10 feet. Its venom is a potent neurotoxin and can lead to death quickly if the victim doesn't receive antivenom.\n\nIt has been reported in the state back in the early 2000s, but has not become established.\n\nIn 2015, an Orlando-area man lost his king cobra. It wasn't the first time he'd lost a venomous snake. It was recovered in his neighbor's garage after being missing five weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/02/us/national-parks-climate-extreme-weather-impacts/index.html", "title": "How is climate change affecting national parks? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Garrett Dickman drove through Yosemite National Park early this week, he passed through a diverse band of large trees – conifer, red fir, lodgepole pine – and noticed a grim pattern: many of the trees were either dead or dying.\n\n“It was really striking to see that every single tree seems to be getting hit by either climatic changes; it could be dying from drought, or it could be insect attack or fungus, but they’re certainly weakened,” Dickman, a forest ecologist with the National Park Service, told CNN. “There’s a big shift happening right now, and it’s right in front of our eyes.”\n\nThe consequences of the climate crisis – more wildfires, devastating drought, sea level rise, flooding, ecological disease – are plaguing the country’s national parks. Most recently, unprecedented flash flooding overwhelmed Yellowstone National Park and some of its surrounding areas.\n\nScientists and officials say it signals a dramatic change unfolding at the nation’s most prized parks. And unless the planet slashes fossil fuel emissions, scientists believe the climate crisis could drastically alter the landscapes, cultural sites and ecosystems in the parks, potentially making them inaccessible for humans and uninhabitable for other species.\n\nEmployee housing fell into Yellowstone River during flooding on June 13, 2022. Gina Riquier/NPS/Getty Images\n\nYellowstone's North Entrance Road was washed out by the flooding. Doug Kraus/NPS/Getty Images\n\nWhat happened at Yellowstone is also a classic example of the climate crisis converging with failed emergency disaster response, said Marcy Rockman, a former climate change adaptation coordinator for the Park Service.\n\n“When I heard they were evacuating every visitor from Yellowstone, I was like, ‘Oh my god, evacuating every visitor was not a part of our climate change scenarios,’ ” Rockman told CNN. “Seeing what my former colleagues at Yellowstone are having to deal with now, it’s like … I’m worried for them.”\n\nThat the parks’ climate change response “now involves ‘how do you evacuate everyone from a park’ is just a gut-punch that I don’t think we had fully taken in when we started the climate program,” she said.\n\nAs more climate change-fueled events occur, CNN talked to Park Service officials and scientists to see how the climate crisis may alter the ecosystems and landscapes of some of the country’s most beloved national treasures.\n\nYosemite is just one of many examples of threatened and disappearing national parks. @Rene_MarshCNN reports @kaitlancollins pic.twitter.com/INl66OOcFC — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) July 8, 2022\n\nYosemite National Park\n\nClimate change has already touched one of the Sierra Nevada’s most valuable sites. Yosemite National Park has been forced to close several times in recent years because of extreme heat, deadly wildfires or dangerous air quality from fire smoke.\n\nThe average temperature in Yosemite may increase by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, which is several degrees higher than global temperatures are predicted to surge.\n\nA deer grazes in Cook's Meadow at Yosemite. Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nAnd it’s not a future threat. Park rangers and scientists have already observed the shrinking snowpack, dried-up waterfalls, increasing fire activity and more tree die-offs like those Dickman observed.\n\n“People come to Yosemite because we have some of the biggest trees on Earth,” Dickman said. “But the whole experience in Yosemite is starting to be altered … We’re just kind of seeing that tree line lift up in a weird way.”\n\nAs average temperature increases, it increases the elevation of where trees can grow. Dickman said forecast models show this part of the Sierra Nevada could look more like the mountains around Los Angeles, where trees can grow at a higher elevation because of the warmer temperatures.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Yosemite's biggest restoration in history 01:36 - Source: CNN Yosemite's biggest restoration in history 01:36\n\nStudies have also showed the range of small mammals in Yosemite has shifted upslope over the last century as the area warmed.\n\nDickman told CNN even 10 years ago he was concerned about different threats, pointing to how the park dealt more with flooding from powerful storms coming off the Pacific Ocean and less with dangerous wildfires.\n\n“For our preparedness now, it’s really going to be around fire, and to get fire back on the ground in a good way to ward off some of the effects of these climate- and fuels-driven fires,” he said.\n\nGlacier National Park\n\nScientists at Glacier National Park are bracing for its namesakes to disappear entirely.\n\n“If you wanted to see a glacier, go to Glacier National Park in Montana,” Beissinger said “But you better get there soon, because the glaciers are going to be gone from Glacier National Park, probably sometime in the next decade or two. They’ve been disappearing.”\n\nThe Jackson Glacier Overlook, along the east side of Going-to-the-Sun Road is one of the easiest spots in the park to see a glacier. NPS/Glacier National Park\n\nIn the past 50 years, some of the Montana park’s 26 glaciers have lost as much as 80% of their area. Loss of glacier ice is a huge threat for aquatic ecosystems within the park that rely on cold freshwater. It also threatens the surrounding area with increased flooding.\n\nMuch like the flooding at Yellowstone in June, the climate crisis is expected to trigger more flooding at Glacier. As Yellowstone closed down to visitors during its flooding disaster, officials at Glacier warned visitors their park was also experiencing dangerous water levels.\n\nDid flooding in @YellowstoneNPS divert your trip toward Glacier?\n\n\n\nBe aware that we are experiencing some flooding too. Also, you will want to read about our vehicle reservation system before you arrive.\n\n\n\nVideo description: A short clip zooms in on water cascading. pic.twitter.com/ZhQ9hfN84I — Glacier National Park (@GlacierNPS) June 16, 2022\n\nMelting glaciers are also a significant source of sea level rise. Caitlyn Florentine, a research physical scientist at the US Geological Survey who studies US glaciers, noted the glaciers at Glacier National Park are already quite small. But when taken together with other glaciers globally under a warming climate, they are enough to cause significant sea level rise around the planet.\n\n“The meltwater from these glaciers affects the streams that are very high in the alpine environment,” Florentine told CNN, pointing to a study which found “the presence or absence of glacier meltwater will be felt by water in the rivers that feed agricultural communities to the east of the park.”\n\nGiven the rate at which climate change is accelerating, researchers say the timing of the loss depends highly on how much fossil fuel we burn in the future.\n\nSequoia National Park\n\nJust south of the Yosemite Valley in California, the West’s megadrought is weakening and destroying the nation’s largest, oldest trees in Sequoia National Park.\n\nSix fires over the course of six years burned more than 85% of the giant sequoia grove acreage across the larger Sierra Nevada, compared to around 25% over the previous 100 years, the National Park Service reported. Three of those fires crossed into Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, forcing officials to close the parks to the public and take dramatic steps to protect the trees.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Climate change could wipe out iconic California landmarks 03:04 - Source: CNN\n\nIn September 2021, park biologists wrapped the base of General Sherman – the planet’s largest living tree – in protective foil as the flames of the KNP Complex fire approached. General Sherman is estimated to be anywhere from 2,200 to 2,700 years old, and has grown to 275 feet.\n\nThe tree’s diameter is more than 36 feet at its base, which is about as wide as six average cars.\n\nPark scientists have already seen “major effects” of climate change, said Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, mainly in the form of hotter, drier droughts and how they fuel extreme wildfires.\n\n“We had a historic superintendent’s building burned down in a recent wildfire,” Brigham told CNN. “So those kinds of impacts are already happening in lots of national parks, and will continue to happen.”\n\nNPS personnel fold up fire resistant aluminum and fiberglass blankets as they unwrap General Sherman.

Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAssistant Fire Manager Leif Mathiesen, of the Sequoia & Kings Canyon Nation Park Fire Service, looks for an opening in the burned-out sequoias in Redwood Mountain Grove. Gary Kazanjian/AP\n\nBrigham added the climate crisis is “already changing our day-to-day operational business of managing our national parks.”\n\nBesides maintaining public amenities and ensuring endangered species are safe, she said park employees – who have also been personally impacted by wildfires – are working even harder to clear up trails and engage in new emergency response systems to prepare for events such as fire risks.\n\n“People who work in these places like me and all the other staff really care deeply about keeping these places the spectacular environments that they are for the enjoyment of visitors, and we are seeing changes,” Brigham said. “I came to Sequoia National Park from a different Park in 2015, and we were already seeing lots of dead trees from hotter drought, and that’s only been made worse by the wildfires.”\n\nNational parks, like Sequoia National Park, “is a place where we share values, as Americans, in terms of our heritage,” she added. “It’s a place where we can connect and see the impacts and maybe make some choices to reduce those impacts in the future.”\n\nGrand Canyon National Park\n\nThe impact of warmer temperatures, severe lack of rainfall and stunted streamflow on the Colorado River is alarming at Grand Canyon National Park, said Mark Nebel, the park’s geosciences program manager.\n\nThe climate crisis is critically altering the Arizona park’s ecosystems, habitats for species, as well as its hydrology, Nebel told CNN.\n\n“We’re seeing snow melting about a month earlier than it did a century ago, and there’s evaporation as well, and that really affects the levels of water in the [Grand Canyon’s groundwater] aquifer,” Nebel said. “We’re concerned about how it will affect the springs, which are our drinking water source, as well as the vast majority of the biodiversity around the springs.”\n\nVasey’s Paradise Spring is one which has gone from consistently reliable to bone dry.\n\nWhat Vasey's Paradise Spring looks like in a normal springtime flow. NPS/Grand Canyon National Park\n\nVasey's Paradise Spring in 2022. Park officials say they dont totally understand why the spring is cut off, but they suspect it was caused by the lower groundwater table. There are other normally reliable springs in the park that are also showing erratic behavior. NPS/Grand Canyon National Park\n\nThe West’s megadrought has devastated the Colorado River, which is a vital resource for the national park. Increased flooding, rock slides, wildfires, and heavy storms also pose severe challenges to Grand Canyon’s cultural sites, infrastructure, surrounding communities, fisheries and other wildlife.\n\nBecause of a hotter and drier climate, as well as aging infrastructure, Nebel said the park is changing the source of their water supply from groundwater, which has long relied on one of Grand Canyon’s springs, to surface water supply elsewhere.\n\nThe plummeting level of Lake Powell upstream on the Colorado River – the nation’s second-largest reservoir – is affecting species in the river downstream and at the park according to Nebel.\n\n“With the water level lowering at Lake Powell, these warm-water invasive fish that are normally near the surface are coming through the dam and getting into the Grand Canyon National Park and threatening native fisheries,” he said. “Our fisheries folks have been working really hard to remove like invasive trout from streams, where these native fish reproduce.”\n\nNebel acknowledge for most visitors who are only there for a few days, the impacts of climate change in the park are largely imperceptible. It’s different for the park researchers and staff who live with them day in and day out.\n\n“For most of us who work at Grand Canyon, we see these crises, we see the danger, we see the damage,” Nebel said, and “we see that it’s gonna get worse.”\n\nJoshua Tree National Park\n\nFor Steve Beissinger, ecology professor at the University of California in Berkeley, national parks like Joshua Tree in Southern California are vital for scientific research. But over the years he has seen how climate change has threatened the park’s biodiversity by pushing many species – including small mammals and birds – toward the brink of extinction.\n\n“When we go back and resurvey places [in Joshua Tree] that the early scientists at UC Berkeley visited a century ago, we find about half as many birds, and that’s because it’s warmed and dried so much,” Beissinger told CNN. “What we’re seeing is a whole kind of change in a community; a collapse in the case of birds. For park managers, there’s limits of what they can actually do to reverse this because of the climate change effects.”\n\nThe extreme heat, dire lack of rain and drought conditions at Joshua Tree have triggered a decline in several species, including the cactus mouse, kangaroo rat, mountain quail and other bird species.\n\nA visitor walks through Hidden Valley in Joshua Tree National Park. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nJoshua trees in the park. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nJoshua trees themselves are also at risk. Scientists have concluded the western Joshua trees could lose up to 90% of its current habitat in the Mojave Desert by as early as 2070. In mid-June, the California Fish and Game Commission considered whether to list the tree under the state’s Endangered Species Act. The four-person commission was split down the middle and so failed to secure a majority vote to give the species protected status.\n\nJane Rodgers, chief of science and resource stewardship at Joshua Tree National Park, said they’re “fortunate to have some longer term data which is hard to come by for land managers to be able to inform and make decisions.” She said such comprehensive data allows park managers to b proactive rather than reactive to extreme weather and drought.\n\n“We are looking at a holistic portfolio of things we can do to protect these areas,” Rodgers told CNN. “It’s not just continuing to collect data, but also protecting these areas by managing fuels or creating fuel breaks, so that firefighters have a higher probability of stopping a fire. We want to be prepared for that ahead of time as much as we can.”\n\nEverglades National Park\n\nUrban sprawl is nestled next to protected wetlands on the fringes of Everglades National Park. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAs US national parks in the West continue to be plagued with drought, the opposite is taking shape in the eastern end of the country.\n\nEverglades National Park in southern Florida is disappearing because of sea level rise. The vast wetlands are now half their original size not only due to rising sea levels but also rampant urban development.\n\nResearchers with the National Park Service have observed an increase in water level at some inland, freshwater areas in the Everglades over the last 50 years, on par with the pace of rising seas in the region.\n\nThe park has also been battered by intense hurricanes in recent years. The Everglades, which encompasses 1.5 million acres of mangroves, marshes and upland forest, is a critical buffer, absorbing the fury of tropical storms. Hurricane Irma pummeled the region in 2017, and the Everglades took much of the storm’s wrath and protected inland communities.\n\nBut scientists warn the barriers won’t be around for much longer. Because of the dramatic changes seen in US national parks, Dickman said people should make climate-conscious choices to help preserve the landscapes for future generations.\n\n“The history of America is painted [in these parks], anything from some of the good in our history, some of the bad of our history, and it protects some of the most incredible landscapes on Earth,” Dickman said. “I have traveled around the Earth and it is hard to go to a place more beautiful than the national parks of America. And we so owe the next generation the ability to experience these places as we have.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/10/wave-undie-run-undone-florida-man-series-news-around-states/39466837/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Lawmakers postponed a vote on a proposed abortion ban Thursday after anger erupted in the state Senate when some Republicans stripped an exception for rape and incest from the bill. Shouting broke out among senators when the exemption was removed without a roll call vote. Democrats and some Republicans objected to the change to the bill, which would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, being gaveled through quickly. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh suggested lawmakers go home for the weekend to cool off and resume debate Tuesday. Marsh said he supports an exemption for rape and wants a roll call vote on the matter next week. The anger underscored tensions over the proposal that would become the most stringent abortion restriction in the country if approved.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Eight conservation groups sued Tuesday to stop the largest sale of Alaska old growth timber in decades, claiming the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental policy and its own management plan for the Tongass National Forest with the sale. The agency’s plan is to harvest as much as 225 million board feet of old growth timber from Prince of Wales Island. The Forest Service didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason, who has dealt two setbacks to the Trump administration this year. She found that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when reversing bans on offshore drilling and that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge.\n\nArizona\n\nMarble Canyon: One of the most exclusive and dramatic hiking spots in the Southwest could see bigger crowds under a new proposal unveiled Wednesday. The Bureau of Land Management is weighing increasing its daily visitor limits from 20 to 96 people a day at The Wave, a popular rock formation near the Arizona-Utah border. A 6-mile round-trip hike through tall sandstone buttes and sage brush is required to get to the Wave, a wide, sloping basin of searing reds, oranges and yellows in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument. The agency is asking for public comment, and changes could be implemented as soon as October, agency official Mike Herder says. Visitors compete for permits in a monthly online lottery and at daily walk-in drawings. Less than 5% of the 150,000 people who wanted to hike the trail last year were actually able to do it, according to federal data.\n\nArkansas\n\nBatesville: A juvenile detention facility synonymous with neglect and abuse is to be shuttered and the building transformed into a treatment center for sex trafficking survivors, officials say. White River Regional Juvenile Detention Center will close by this summer, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Jonathan Pickering, facility director, says the new center will provide youths who were forced into the sex trade with at least three individual and three group therapy sessions a week. Pickering says families can join the sessions too, and staff will arrange transportation if necessary. The facility has a storied history. In April, a former White River jailer was sentenced to seven years in prison for what a judge called “sadistic and completely unjustified” punishments for disorderly juveniles. Another was imprisoned in March for violating youths’ rights and falsifying documents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo has two new arrivals: a pair of endangered African penguin chicks. The zoo announced Wednesday that the fluffy chicks – named Doug and Barbara in honor of Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global, and his wife, Barbara Myers – hatched two months ago. The eggs came from two breeding couples. The zoo says it’s the first time eggs laid by its adult penguins have hatched there. Staffers have been working with the chicks to get them used to humans before they are introduced into the penguin colony in the next few weeks. African penguins are an endangered species. Their numbers have dropped by more than 60% in the past three decades, and only 23,000 breeding pairs are known to exist. The decline is blamed on several factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and lack of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The end-of-semester Undie Run at Colorado State University started innocently enough, with a few hundred participants in their skivvies and a handful of clothes-filled trash bags carted off to Goodwill, according to its first student organizer. But more than a decade later, CSU is putting its foot down, taking its hardest stance yet against an event it now says is characterized by public intoxication and rampant sexual misconduct. Its message – in a letter distributed to students, emailed to parents and printed in multiple full-page ads in the campus newspaper – is clear: “The university will not allow the ‘undie run’ to take place this year.” The run, which has never been sanctioned or supported by CSU, has sprung up every spring since 2008 thanks to Facebook groups led by largely unnamed organizers and campus word-of-mouth. It’s typically held on the last day of classes before finals week, which for this semester is Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has voted to incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, following a marathon, overnight debate. Weary lawmakers advanced the bill to the Senate, 85-59, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition, shortly after noon Thursday. The occasionally contentious debate, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, was wrapped by New Haven Rep. Robyn Porter, the Democratic House chairwoman of the General Assembly’s Labor Committee. Referencing her own early struggles as a divorced mother of two, Porter said the wage increase will help those who “don’t have two nickels to rub together” and feel like $10 is $100. But Republicans warned the wage increase will harm an already fragile state economy and lead to job reductions and more automation.\n\nDelaware\n\nMilford: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of the state’s best-known businesses, announced Thursday that it is merging with Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard hard cider. The merger, valued at about $300 million, is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions. It’s a stunning turn of events for the Milford-based, independent brewery founded by Sam Calagione, a Massachusetts native, and his wife Mariah, who was born in Delaware. Dogfish Head plans to retain its name and will still be a craft brewery, according to a press release sent out Thursday. The brewery began in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 as a “nanobrewery.” As the company grew, brewing moved to its current Milton site. The brewery and the tasting room have since become one of Delaware’s top tourist destinations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chair of the City Council has proposed an amendment to the city’s 2020 budget that would severely limit access to public records. The Washington Post reports the legislation would allow the city to reject record requests that don’t include specifications about the sought documents, including the subject matter, names of senders and recipients, and a date range. It would only permit the disclosure of information “regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.” Chairman Phil Mendelson says the Freedom of Information Act “wasn’t intended for fishing expeditions.” His proposal comes after the newspaper requested email records through FOIA and found that Councilman Jack Evans used his government email to pitch himself to area lobbyists.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show. Oxygen Media, which in 2017 announced a full-time shift to true-crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on “America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State” has been added to its projects. There is no premiere date for the show. The series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films “Get Out,” “The Purge” and “Insidious.” With the working title of “Florida Man,” the series will “unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,” Oxygen officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s law enforcement will have to preserve rape kits for much longer than what was previously required under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week. Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, the bill’s main supporter, says the DNA evidence in the rape kits will help solve cold cases and pursue justice for survivors of sexual violence. Previously, Georgia only required rape kits to be stored for 10 years. The new law requires the state to preserve the evidence 30 years after the arrest date or seven years from the completion of a prison sentence, whichever occurs later. If there are no arrests, the kit must be stored for 50 years. Holcomb also authored a 2016 law that helped cut down on the state’s backlog of rape kits.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal officials are asking the public to give adequate space to a monk seal that has been resting on a Waikiki beach. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that the female seal identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi has come onto the beach in Honolulu four times in recent days. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species protected by state and federal laws that typically forages at night and “hauls up” to rest on beaches during the day. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials ask members of the public in the high-traffic area to remain behind barriers set up to protect the seal. Officials say Kaiwi has previously given birth to pups in south and east Oahu. Although she does not appear pregnant at this time, it is possible.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State agencies are racing to beat a Friday deadline to keep alive thousands of administrative rules after the Legislature’s House of Representatives in April killed a bill reauthorizing them. Republican Gov. Brad Little directed state agencies to submit temporary and pending rules by Friday to be vetted before publication in a special Idaho Administrative Bulletin on June 19. A 21-day public comment period follows before the rules can attain temporary status by July 1 and remain in effect. Many state agencies have started the process, and on Wednesday the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in a special meeting voted 4-0 to authorize the Idaho Department of Lands to initiate temporary rulemaking on the agency’s oil and gas regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Plans are in the works to open a visitors’ center for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Laurent House, which opened as a museum four years ago. The Rockford Register Star reports the Laurent House Foundation plans to renovate dilapidated properties across the street from the home. It will offer a visitors’ center and gift shop and have offices and parking. Private donations are funding the $500,000 project. An estimated 2,000 people toured the home last year, and it has attracted visitors from Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. The 2,600-square-foot Laurent House, built in the early 1950s, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s the only house Wright designed specifically for someone with disabilities. The foundation won approval Monday from the Rockford City Council to annex the properties.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Sports betting will become legal and construction of two new casinos will be allowed in the state under a bill signed by the governor Wednesday. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb endorsed the bill on his final day to act on the measure approved by lawmakers after they reached a deal in the final hours of this year’s legislative session. So far this year, Indiana joins Montana and Tennessee in moving to legalize sports wagering after six other states moved quickly following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing it nationwide last year. Indiana sports wagering could start in September. Bets could be placed by anyone 21 or older at a casino or by mobile devices after a bettor has registered with an Indiana casino. Holcomb says the state’s casino industry has faced greater competition as neighboring states have legalized more forms of gambling.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: In an effort to help the environment without skimping on photographic fun, the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, made up of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History, have made an enticing offer for graduates. Confetti has always been a part of graduations, but the museum group wants it to become a thing of the past, posting on its Facebook page that it’s ready to digitally alter graduation photos to add confetti. The post asked students to consider that “many kinds of confetti are not biodegradable and are a health risk to our wildlife.” Interested students can message the Facebook page directly or email jessica-smith-7@uiowa.edu to send their photos to a museum designer.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new government report says the state’s winter wheat crop is maturing more slowly than usual. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported this week that about 14% of the wheat has now headed. That is near what it was a year ago but well behind the 41% average for the date. The agency also rated wheat condition as 10% poor to very poor, 32% in fair shape, and 58% in good to excellent condition. Growers have also seeded about 41% of their corn acreage, behind the 51% that is normally in the ground by this time. Planting of soybean and sorghum crops in Kansas is just getting underway, with progress at or near the average.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign is capitalizing on a fellow Republican’s attack, selling “Cocaine Mitch” shirts on his campaign’s website. The shirts appear to have been hot sellers. The Kentucky Republican’s campaign Twitter account said Wednesday that McConnell was closing in on one of his biggest fundraising days of the year and thanked people who chipped in by purchasing shirts. The shirt shows a faceless figure with a sprinkling of cocaine on the side. It says “Mitch” on the front and “cartel member” on the back. The Senate leader’s campaign is laughing off an attack by ex-coal executive and failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship, who called him “Cocaine Mitch” after a magazine article alleged drugs were found aboard a cargo ship owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to exempt diapers and tampons from the state sales tax stalled Wednesday in the Senate, only to be revived later in a different form and successfully sent to the House for debate. Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, proposed a constitutional change to remove the 4.45% state sales tax from diapers and feminine hygiene products starting in 2021. Senators refused to include that exemption in the state constitution. The Senate voted 21-12 for the measure, but it needed 26 votes to pass because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote. But later in the day, after stymieing the constitutional change, senators agreed to include the tax break in statute. That law change passed in a 29-5 vote, moving to the House for consideration. Morrell said the items are essential to women and children, in line with prescription drugs, which are exempt from sales tax.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor is bringing back the state’s Children’s Cabinet in hopes of reducing youth drop-out, recidivism and incarceration rates. Gov. Janet Mills says in a Thursday announcement that she wants to focus on helping Maine children succeed in school, enter the workforce and live healthy lives. The governor says 37 towns of the top 50 with the highest poverty rates in New England in 2010 were located in Maine. She says 1 in 6 Maine children is living in poverty. The Children’s Cabinet dates back to 1996 and last met in 2010. The cabinet has urged Maine to expand quality and accessible early child care and education. Mills also wants to address the number of children suffering substantiated child abuse, which is up 25% from 2017 to 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Some Marylanders are at risk of having their driver’s licenses or identification cards recalled next month if they don’t soon satisfy document requirements that are part of the federally mandated Real ID process, according to a state agency. Some residents who have the new Real ID card still must bring in certain documentation to comply with the federal REAL ID requirement, according to a Thursday news release from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The overall deadline for obtaining a Real ID is Oct. 1, 2020, but more than 66,300 people with a new Real ID star license or identification card have not yet filed the required documents, the release says. Without action, MVA says, administrators will start flagging the affected driver’s licenses and identification cards in June as “recalled,” which would result in confiscation if drivers get pulled over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDartmouth: The federal government says a program that sells scallops to pay for marine science will include a study of how shellfish harvesting affects sea turtles in this year’s projects. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside will help pay for 13 projects in 2019 and 2020. Regulators use the program to set aside more than a million pounds of scallops, generating millions of dollars for the science projects. Fishermen and scientists collaborate on the program. This year’s awards include a pair to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to use underwater cameras to get a better handle on East Coast scallop population health. The award to study sea turtles is slated to go to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and Roger Williams University.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: There’s one more sign a riverfront concert venue has been renamed after Aretha Franklin. Workers on Thursday were taking down the Chene Park sign outside the venue and putting up one reflecting the name change. It features a stylized signature of the Queen of Soul’s first name. Mayor Mike Duggan told mourners at Franklin’s funeral in August that the name would be changed to Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre, saying that “when Aretha Franklin sang, it sounded like the voice of Detroit.” Days later, City Council unanimously approved it. The facility is known for its outdoor stage and summer concerts, and it hosted a Franklin tribute show last summer. She performed at Chene Park in 2015 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The 2019 season starts in June. Franklin died Aug. 16 at 76.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Lawmakers are trying to get their hands around skyrocketing drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices. Bills are moving to tackle the problem, from anti-price gouging efforts to new reporting requirements for drug companies when prices spike. Minnesota Public Radio reports that nearly all those bills have been tucked into House and Senate budget bills and are heading into final negotiations. The bipartisan push has been fueled by personal stories. Nicole Smith-Holt has been a regular around the Capitol, talking about her son Alec Smith, a diabetic who died at age 26 because he was rationing insulin that he couldn’t afford. Both the House and Senate health and human services budgets include assistance for emergency insulin supplies, but their different approaches need to be reconciled.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A police officer helped a driver out of a wrecked sports car and told the man he was “lucky to be alive.” Less than an hour later, the officer was killed by another person who walked up and shot him outside the police station. Biloxi police records show Patrolman Robert McKeithen responded to a crash Sunday night and then returned to the station because he had gotten a flat tire. The driver, Damon Corrigan, 22, told the Sun Herald that McKeithen also accompanied him to a hospital. He says he was shocked to learn the officer had been killed. “The only thing I remember him telling me was that I was so lucky to be alive,” Corrigan told the newspaper. “He was so nice. I felt so bad.” McKeithen, 57, had worked for Biloxi Police Department for almost 24 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republicans in the state House are backing away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the country illegally. The GOP-led House on Thursday voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy and the proposed state budget for public colleges and universities. Missouri schools currently face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Bipartisan Senate and House negotiators earlier this week agreed to end that policy. But opposition from House Republicans could unravel the deal. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass the budget.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill to continue the state’s Medicaid expansion program for another six years, as long as federal funding continues. He was joined at Thursday’s signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The program provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. Buttrey’s bill adds work requirements, strengthens an asset test and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. Bullock on Thursday also vetoed a bill that sought to give regulatory backing to insurance companies so they could negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Bullock argued the legislation could lead to higher costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge is considering his verdict in a lawsuit that says six convenience stores along Interstate 80 in the state posted misleading signs about prices. A nonjury trial was held last in week in Lincoln in a February 2017 lawsuit filed by several individuals and the Coalition for Ethical Petroleum Marketing. It accuses North Platte-based Wilkinson Development of violating the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act. Wilkinson is accused of advertising low prices to attract travelers to its Fat Dog stores but then selling gas at those prices only at a limited number of pumps, intentionally hoping travelers accidentally filled up with more expensive fuel. The company president has denied the accusation.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An unusually wet stretch of showers and thunderstorms may help Sin City surpass its yearly average for rainfall this week. And it’s not even monsoon season yet. Since January, the National Weather Service has logged 3.8 inches of rainfall in Las Vegas – a few thimbles away from the yearly average of 4.19 inches. “Getting over (4.19 inches) isn’t impossible,” says meteorologist Kate Guillet. “We’re just going to have to wait and see.” The National Weather Service estimates a quarter to a half an inch of rain could fall on the Las Vegas Valley between Thursday and Sunday – and higher amounts are possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: As some states and communities have slowly begun to acknowledge their often purposeful erasure of Native Americans from the dominant narrative, the voices, cultures and histories of the Abenaki and Wabanaki peoples were recently given a rightful home in the oldest “neighborhood” settled by Europeans in what’s now the state of New Hampshire. “People of the Dawnland,” an exhibit at the Jones House Family Discover Center in the 1600s Puddle Dock neighborhood, opens this month. The neighborhood, now known as the outdoor Strawbery Banke Museum, did in fact have remnants of indigenous people, such as pottery, projectile points and tent holes, discovered by archaeologists, but the museum has previously largely focused its efforts on the colonial aspects of the early settlement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s beaches, casinos, forests and cities attracted tourists who spent nearly $45 billion last year. Gov. Phil Murphy says tourism spending in New Jersey has increased for nine years in a row. Speaking at a tourism conference Thursday in Trenton, Murphy said the tourism industry generated $5 billion in state and local taxes in 2018. He said about 111 million people visited the Garden State last year, up more than 7% from the previous year. Tourism is the state’s seventh-largest industry, supporting nearly 334,000 jobs. When indirect jobs, such as those that supply the industry, are included, the figure rises to more than 531,000 jobs. Food and beverages and lodging accounted for the largest share of tourism spending.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: World-premiere operas derived from the gender-bending Broadway hit “M. Butterfly” and from meditations on Victorian-era repression in Bram Stroker’s “Dracula” are coming to the Santa Fe Opera and its open-air stage in the high desert. Opera General Director Robert Meya on Wednesday announced upcoming productions for 2020 that include retooled staples such as “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (“The Barber of Seville”) and the revival of Tim Albery’s version of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”). In recent years, Santa Fe has been the backdrop for productions about the dawn of the nuclear age in 1940s New Mexico and a world premiere of a techno-infused opera about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been a regular visitor to performances in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and friends, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years behind bars. New York Judge Diane Kiesel said at the sentencing hearing that she was “stunned by the depth of the defendant’s deception” and turned down a request by Sorokin’s lawyers that she be sentenced to time she has already spent in jail awaiting trial. Sorkin, 28, was convicted last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services and has been in custody since her October 2017 arrest. Sorokin went by Anna Delvey when she defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrity circles into believing she had a fortune of about $67 million overseas that could cover her jet-setting lifestyle, high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMurphy: The U.S. Forest Service is proposing one of the largest timber sales in the nearly 100-year history of the Nantahala National Forest, and the public comment period ends Friday. The proposal, known as the Buck Project, is drawing concern from conservation groups worried about harmful effects of logging and road building in this “special place” of potential wilderness and old-growth areas. But it is being welcomed by others who say it will improve forest health and wildlife habitat in forest areas long overdue for a trim. The Buck Project, which includes a timber sale as well as forest restoration activities including prescribed burns and stream improvement projects, would take place in a 20,638-acre analysis area in southeastern Clay County, in the Tusquitee Ranger District of Nantahala, the state’s largest and most western forest.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner says lawmakers may be called back into session over legislation that limits the powers of the state auditor. The Legislature passed a measure late in the session that requires the auditor’s office to get lawmakers’ permission to conduct “performance audits.” The amendment was put in the auditor’s budget that passed unanimously in the Senate and by a large margin in the House. Wardner says he didn’t know the amendment had been put in the budget bill and thinks other senators didn’t, either. Wardner says he and House Minority Leader Chet Pollert will meet with Auditor Josh Gallion next week to discuss the issue and how it will affect the agency. Leaders can recall the Legislature if they haven’t used all their allotted days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters in the capital have agreed to let the city take on as much as $1 billion more in debt to pay for renovations to roads and bridges, underground utilities and other infrastructure. Near the top of spending among issues approved Tuesday is a new municipal courthouse, estimated to cost about $130 million. Voters also approved reserving $50 million for affordable housing as Columbus prepares for a regional plan to address what experts say is a 54,000-unit shortage. The Columbus Dispatch reports this is the largest bond package approved since 2008, when voters passed a $1.7 billion debt plan, mostly to pay for water and sewer projects. The projects won’t raise taxes, but the city could raise property taxes if it can’t repay the debt.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former U.S. soldier from the state who was pardoned this week for his 2009 conviction for killing an Iraqi prisoner says he initially didn’t answer the White House’s phone call to tell him of the pardon. Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna says he was on the phone with his father, retired FBI agent Scott Behenna, when the call came about 2:30 p.m. Monday as he was driving. He didn’t recognize the number and thought it might be a telemarketer, so he let it go to voicemail. After checking his messages, he returned the call and was told President Donald Trump was granting him a pardon and would call him back. When Behenna’s phone rang again, it was Trump’s office putting the president on the line so he could tell Behenna personally. He was convicted in 2009 of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone in the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur Mohamed, an unarmed Iraqi prisoner.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A bill to allow dentists in the state to administer vaccines to patients has been signed into law. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Oregon is the first state in the country to allow dentists to administer any vaccine available at a primary care doctor’s office. Most people may not get their measles, polio and tetanus shots from the dentist, but Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry Dean Phillip Marucha says they might want vaccines relevant to oral health such as HPV. He says a large percentage of new oral cancer diagnoses are linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Marucha said this law allows a dentist to educate patients about the value of the HPV vaccine and then administer it onsite.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The State Board of Education is giving its support to proposals by Gov. Tom Wolf to require students start schooling by age 6 and continue until they’re at least 18. The board voted unanimously Wednesday for the Democratic governor’s proposals that he unveiled in February. The Republican-controlled Legislature still must approve the proposals for them to take effect. The Wolf administration says lowering the mandatory start age from 8 to 6 would affect about 3,300 children. Officials say only one other state allows parents to keep children out of school until age 8, a policy Pennsylvania adopted in the late 19th century. Pennsylvania’s minimum age to drop out of school is currently 17. The administration says nearly 14,000 students drop out without graduating every year in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax “original and creative works” sold by writers, composers and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state’s taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not “original and creative works.” A Department of Revenue spokesman said in a statement that the department had not received notice of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has agreed to provide $120 million in tax breaks to the Carolina Panthers to move their practice fields and team headquarters out of North Carolina. The 27-15 vote Thursday came after contentious debate, with several senators questioning whether public money should be given to a billionaire NFL owner and saying the $3.8 billion proposed economic benefit of the new facility is wildly exaggerated. The bill, enthusiastically backed by Gov. Henry McMaster, would exempt the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. The team will continue to play games 15 miles north in Charlotte, North Carolina. McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The latest federal census of agriculture finds the number of farms in the state has dropped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2017 census, South Dakota’s farmland was worked by fewer farming operations from 2012 to 2017. The census is conducted every five years. Statewide, more than 43 million acres were operated as farms. But there were 2,000 fewer farming operations in the state in 2017 than in 2012. The Aberdeen News reports the biggest drop came from farms operating between 10 and 1,000 acres. That number dropped by 1,850 over those five years. Nate Franzen, president of the Ag Banking Division at First Dakota National Bank based in Yankton, cites several reasons why farming operations are going out of business, including retirement, financial struggles and other business opportunities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The National Civil Rights Museum is being honored by a federal agency that supports the nation’s museums. The Institute of Museum and Library Services said in a news release Tuesday that the Memphis-based museum is one of 10 recipients of National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Institute officials say the award honors museums and libraries that make exceptional contributions to their communities. Opened in 1991, the museum is built on the site of the former Lorraine Motel. Civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot while standing on the hotel’s balcony April 4, 1968. The museum chronicles the history of the U.S. civil rights movement and holds discussions and events related to civil and human rights issues.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Electricity demand is expected to hit record levels this summer, and with a thin margin of reserve power, the operator of the state’s grid says it may have to ask businesses and consumers to conserve. Officials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are not ruling out rolling blackouts, although they say other measures are more likely, including importing power from other grids. ERCOT predicted Wednesday that demand in the state will rise as high as 74,853 megawatts. That’s 1,300 megawatts higher than the record set last July 19. The grid operator predicts demand will grow at an above-normal rate of 2.5% to 3% every year through 2022. Demand is booming partly because of growing West Texas oil and gas operations and industrial development along the Gulf Coast.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A popular three-day music festival featuring the likes of rapper G-Eazy has been canceled after state officials refused to grant a liquor license. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the authorities cited past drug and alcohol-related violations in refusing to grant a permit for the Bonanza Campout, which was canceled Wednesday. The 4-year-old event had been scheduled for June 21-23 near Heber City, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City. It would have presented 36 artists, including electronic-music producer DJ Snake and Australian pop-rock duo Empire of the Sun. Organizers said in a statement that all ticket and lodging purchases for the event will be refunded and that they plan to have the festival again in 2020.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Lawmakers are considering steps to make it easier for prison inmates to reduce the length of their sentences through good behavior or acts of heroism. The previous “good time” system was repealed in 2005 because it was thought to be too complex. Corrections Commissioner Mike Touchette says Vermont is one of a handful of states that lacks a good time program. Currently only prison work-camp inmates can earn shorter sentences. The Legislature is considering a number of proposals. One would allow inmates and offenders on furlough to earn a five-day sentence reduction for every month without a major discipline violation. Touchette says providing incentives for good behavior and rewarding that good behavior is “much more effective” than pure punishment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam has proclaimed May “Second Chance Month” in a bid to focus attention on criminal justice reform and inmate re-entry programs. Northam said in a statement Wednesday that redemption is a “fundamental American value” and that his administration is committed to making sure that former inmates have the support they need to succeed. The governor’s proclamation comes a few months after he asked Virginians for a second chance following a blackface scandal that almost forced him from office. Northam has since prioritized efforts to address long-standing racial inequities, particularly those related to the criminal justice system. The Democratic governor was recently able to overcome strong opposition from key GOP lawmakers and eliminate the suspension of driver’s licenses for motorists with unpaid court fines and costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A state official says wolves should be removed from the federal endangered species list in the entirety of the state. Washington Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind in April wrote a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of the proposal to delist wolves in the Lower 48 states. Susewind calls the proposal “appropriate and timely” as wolves are recovering. Wolves in the eastern third of Washington are already delisted. The Center for Biological Diversity criticized the letter, saying the idea of stripping federal protections from wolves is “appalling.” The environmental group contends 72% of Washington residents want federal protection. The federal government has already delisted wolves in the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, as well as in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClay: A new rail trail is set to be built in the state. Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday that the state has signed a letter of intent to purchase land for the project. The trail will use 72 miles of existing rail lines in Clay and Kanawha counties, along the Elk River and Buffalo Creek. Justice says the tracks will be converted into trails for walking, hiking, biking or other recreational purposes. He says the project could become the second-longest rail trail east of the Mississippi. Justice says the he hopes portions of the trail will be up and running by summer 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWest Allis:A plate of eggs stole the attention of social media this week when the president’s favorite TV show, “Fox and Friends,” broadcast from a local diner. Johnny V’s says the plate of a whopping 10 sunny side up eggs that appeared in front of a man deriding politicians’ plans for “free this, free that” was actually part of its King of Johnny V’s breakfast special, which also includes eight huge pancakes, a pound of hash browns, three pieces of bacon, three pieces of sausage, a piece of ham and Texas toast. If a single person can finish it in an hour, they get the meal and a T-shirt free. They also get their picture posted on a wall. The staff was hoping the King challenge would get a shout-out from the Fox TV host, but time apparently didn’t allow for it.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: National forest managers in the western part of the state expect to see large numbers of mushroom hunters in the weeks ahead. Forests that have recently burned are prime places to look for tasty morel mushrooms. A large area of Bridger-Teton National Forest that burned in 2018 could be prime hunting grounds. Morels also like wet weather, and the region has received plenty of rain and snow this spring. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest officials have implemented a $300 fee for morel hunters who sell their finds. They will only allow commercial morel hunting in the northern part of the Roosevelt Fire burn area. Recreational morel hunters can hunt anywhere in the forest for free but may not collect more than 3 gallons of morels.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/outdoors/fishing/2017/07/07/goliath-groupers-stuart-ready-move-midwest/457578001/", "title": "Bass Pro Shops CEO catches Goliath groupers for aquarium | Video", "text": "BULL SHARK BARGE, STUART — Johnny Morris leaned back in the stand-up fishing harness, transferring all his might and weight into the stout rod in his hands. The big game angler, founder and chief executive officer of the Bass Pro Shops outdoor equipment and accessories mega-retailer, knew he was in a tug of war with a true giant of a fish.\n\nOn the other end of the line was a Goliath grouper that just wouldn't budge. A few minutes earlier, the grouper, half as large as a classic Volkswagen Bug, had eyed a bridled bonito dangled off a boat on the surface. The bonito looked so tasty, the grouper couldn't resist.\n\nWith a few swishes of its rounded tail fin — and for a Goliath grouper of this size, that's about as big as a manatee's — it quickly covered the 40 feet from the ocean floor to its lunch. But after it gulped in the whole bonito, the grouper chose to digest it back on the upside-down steel barge, regardless of what Morris and his friends had planned.\n\nThis wasn't going to be easy.\n\nGrouper gathering\n\nThe entire bout was taking place at a well-known fishing spot about 2 miles south-southeast of St. Lucie Inlet called Bull Shark Barge. The 196-foot-long barge sank in 45 feet of water because of a tug boat captain's error in December 1986. Since then, it has become habitat for a number of popular game and reef fishes including cobia, African pompano and kingfish.\n\nSince it offers about 9 feet of structure above the sandy sea floor, it often recruits schools of bait fish. For some reason, it also is a popular stopover for swarms of bull sharks in the summer months. It's why the spot formerly known by local anglers as The Upside Down Barge was later re-named Bull Shark Barge by late diver Kerry Dillon.\n\nBut the sharks aren't even the largest creatures temporarily living there. A few Goliath grouper, some estimated to weigh upwards of 400 pounds, also call this shallow, sunny spot home. In the summer and early fall, the grouper numbers swell. But researchers believe the gentle giants don't get together in spawning groups until the full moons in August and September. This month, there could be more than three or four dozen grouper larger than 150 pounds hanging around this one reef.\n\nCapt. Mike Murray, of Mattanza charters out of Pirates Cove Resort and Marina in Port Salerno, knows this. Last week, longtime friend and professional captain Terry Robinson called Murray to ask him if he was confident he could catch a few Goliath grouper. Murray laughed.\n\n\"How many do you want to catch?\" Murray said. Robinson told him four, but there was more to this excursion than just the typical catch and release fishing trip. These Goliath groupers had a rare ticket out of town.\n\nSave Goliath\n\nSince 1990, harvest of Goliath groupers has been prohibited in Florida and U.S. federal waters. Prior to that, the large fish was susceptible to overfishing by spearfishing divers who sold their catch. The population numbers of large Goliath grouper observed in areas frequented by hook-and-line fishermen has generated a call to state officials to consider opening the Goliath grouper fishery to some form of limited sustainable harvest.\n\nAnglers who fish for snook and snapper at nearshore reef sites throughout South Florida, including jetties such as Sebastian Inlet and Fort Pierce Inlet, have complained that the oversized opportunistic apex predator is taking too many of their catches off their fishing lines.\n\n\"We've had it happen where customers reeling in cobia, kingfish or mutton snapper — boy, do they love mutton snapper — will lose a fish to a Goliath grouper,\" Murray said. \"I'd be in favor of some sort of system where maybe we could purchase tags to harvest them. I would buy several each year up to $100 each and keep them on board in case I had a charter who wanted to take one home.\"\n\nMurray believes the state and federal protections offered the Goliath grouper were not only necessary in 1990, but also have enabled a strong recovery for the species.\n\n\"I think it's truly a success story how these fish have come back since then,\" Murray said. \"When I moved down here in the early 1990s, we didn't see any of these big Goliaths. Now, they're everywhere. I've found them 12 inches long in my crab trap behind my house, 10-pounders on the flats of the Indian River Lagoon, 40- to 50-pounders around the bridges in this area, and these behemoths out on just about every reef I know of off St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties.\"\n\nIn the coming months, the state will have workshops about Goliath grouper stocks to determine if there is justification to open a limited harvest.\n\nWonders of Wildlife\n\nMorris finally felt a bump. His grappling Goliath grouper started to give in.\n\nRobinson eased the throttle of the 41-foot Offshore Angler Mako while Morris held tight. They used the boat to \"pull\" the grouper away from the barge below, and into open water where the men had better control. Murray, aboard his boat Mattanza, awaited the signal before approaching too closely. Robinson told him the fish was now at the surface. Time to get to work.\n\nOn the wide deck of Mattanza's cockpit was a large blue poly pool about 8 feet in diameter. It was filled with saltwater, and standing alongside it were members of Morris' fish-collection team.\n\nAs the Goliath grouper on the end of Morris' line rolled on its side exhausted and with gases built up in its swim bladder, the men swung into action. They lifted a sling into the water by hand and encircled the girth of the rotund bottom-dweller. Working in careful unison, they lifted the fish (which weighed more than any of the men involved) over the railing of the Mattanza and eased it down into the pool.\n\nImmediately, biologists and aquarists began working to cautiously allow the gases to escape without injuring the fish. Murray pointed the bow toward the inlet and slowly motored back into the Manatee Pocket to deliver the precious cargo.\n\n\"Once we got back to the dock, all of us, including other captains around Pirates Cove, staff and whoever else was hanging around, all pitched in to help us lift the grouper into the back of the collection truck,\" he said.\n\nThe grouper, as well as others caught during the two-day collection trip July 3 and 4, will soon be headed by truck to a huge aquarium 1,200 miles away in Springfield, Missouri. They, and scores of other fish collected from Florida waters in the coming weeks, will become part of Wonders of Wildlife National Museum and Aquarium, a new attraction expected to open in September next door to the headquarters for Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World. It will also be the new home of the International Game Fish Association's Game Fish Museum, which is relocating from Dania Beach, where it has been for the past 15 years.\n\nMurray said the group caught all four Goliath grouper allowed by a Special Activity License permit for prohibited species collection issued in 2016 by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The Special Activity License permit cost is $25.\n\nAccording to an email from FWC public information specialist Amanda Nalley, Special Activity Licenses are issued for activities that require an exception to established marine fisheries regulations for purposes of scientific research, restoration/stock enhancement, education, exhibition, aquaculture broodstock collection, gear innovation and a few other activities. Wonders of Wildlife qualifies under the description for exhibition.\n\nJoining Morris during this collection trip was none other than fishing television personality Bill Dance. Murray said it was fantastic to work alongside fishing legends like Morris and Dance.\n\n\"It was so cool to see how much both of those guys were excited and how they truly love these fish and fishing,\" Murray said. \"They let my son, Brant, and first mate Alex Yates help out, which was so cool.\"\n\nMorris, Robinson and the collection team departed Stuart on Wednesday. Next stop was the Florida Keys, where the groupers will live in a quarantine for about a month before heading to Missouri. Murray said the team was on the water Thursday in the Keys working to collect more fish for the Wonders of Wildlife aquarium, such as tarpon, permit, bonefish, snook and a variety of snapper, grouper and much more.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/15/surfboard-proposal-duke-dorm-opossum-sky-bars-back-news-around-states/40617883/", "title": "Surfboard proposal, Duke dorm opossum: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGadsden: Hundreds of fish have been added to a creek as part of an ongoing effort to boost tourism. The Gadsden Times reports Black Creek was restocked Tuesday with about 1,100 pounds of trout above Noccalula Falls by the Rainbow Fly Fishing Club. The group also stocked 1,000 coppernose bluegill into the watershed in late March. Republican Rep. Craig Lipscomb, of Rainbow City, is a member of the fishing club and says its members are working with the city to fill a gap for activities at the falls in the winter months. Lipscomb says trout fishing in Georgia brings in tens of millions of dollars for the state, and Gadsden would benefit even from a fraction of that.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new FBI report says the state has the nation’s highest rate of sexual assault, and violent crime has increased. Alaska Public Media reports that the 2018 statistical analysis from the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program says Alaska does not conform to a general national decline in violent crime. The annual report uses statistics from law enforcement agencies to provide an analysis of crime at the national, state and municipal levels. The report says violent crime in Alaska increased by 3% from 2017 to 2018 while falling 3% nationally. It says Alaska saw an 11% increase in the number of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, while nationally there were 2.7% more assaults. The FBI says Alaskans reported four times more sexual assaults than the national rate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An increase of bald eagle breeding areas this year didn’t result in more nestlings in the state. Game and Fish Department officials say there were 71 eagle nestlings during the 2019 breeding season, down from 87 hatched last year. During the department’s annual bald eagle survey, raptor biologists counted a minimum of 74 occupied breeding areas statewide – up from the 69 counted last year. But the number of eggs laid dipped from 102 last year to 97 this year. The number of birds that made their first flight fell to 63 from the 70 recorded in 2018. Arizona’s bald eagle population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted within the state and the species was listed as endangered. There currently are an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Court records show a former lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribing three former state lawmakers will be sentenced this month. Rusty Cranford could face up to 10 years in federal prison for bribing Sen. Jon Woods, Rep. Hank Wilkins and Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Cranford had hoped to increase revenue for the Missouri-based nonprofit Preferred Family HealthCare. Cranford also confessed to embezzling from the nonprofit where he worked. His attorney declined to comment. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports court records posted Tuesday show he’ll be sentenced Nov. 25. A federal grand jury in Missouri indicted Cranford on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of accepting bribes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: A Northern California brewery owner upset with devastating fires sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric power lines is producing a beer he named “F--- PG&E,” and the brew has sparked a backlash. Steve Doty, owner of Shady Oak brewery in Santa Rosa, announced the new beer last week on a Facebook post. Doty tells SFGate he meant to draw attention to the negligence of PG&E executives and was stunned by the onslaught of critical comments by people who said they are related to utility employees. Others have attacked Shady Oak by giving it one-star reviews on Yelp and Google or calling the taproom with violent threats. Doty posted an apology to those upset by the beer name but says he is still standing by the name.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after an arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game. Gazella Bensreiti said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office Nov. 5. Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care. After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside. The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident. Arena owner Kroenke Sports & Entertainment called the encounter a misunderstanding and said the guard didn’t recognize that Bensreiti was wearing a hijab.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Republicans in the state Senate are unveiling an alternative transportation plan they say doesn’t rely on tolls or tax increases. Thursday’s plan from the minority party in Connecticut’s Senate comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont pitched his 10-year, $21.3 billion initiative to Senate Democrats. While the Democrats liked projects in Lamont’s proposal, they didn’t like how it includes 14 tolls on bridges across the state. It’s unclear whether the GOP’s plan will ultimately lay the groundwork for a compromise on an issue that has vexed the state for years. Like Lamont’s plan, the 10-year, nearly $18 billion Senate Republican plan also relies on low-cost borrowing from the federal government. Instead of using toll money to pay off the loans, it banks on money from the state’s dedicated transportation fund.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s birding community is mourning the loss of Wilmington resident William “Bill” Stewart Jr., who died Tuesday after battling cancer, while celebrating his legacy of conservation and determination. Stewart, 67, was a well-known birder, conservationist, educator and former gymnastics coach who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to permanently preserve nearly 2,000 acres of land for future generations of birders and Delawareans through the Delaware Bird-A-Thon program he started in 2006. He helped put the First State on the birding map by showing visitors and locals the state’s beauty and international role in shorebird migrations. The Bird-A-Thon effort has raised more than $400,000, which has helped protect properties and start a hawk watch program in northern Delaware, as well as a science education grant for researchers. A celebration of life for Stewart will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at the Delaware Nature Society’s Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A landlord in the district is being forced to pay $1.1 million in rent payments to former residents who homes were plagued by pests, mold and raw sewage and violated housing and fire codes. The Washington Post reports D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that Sanford Capital LLC will pay the settlement to 155 former residents “forced to live in squalor.” Racine’s office had sued the Bethesda, Maryland-based company for violating consumer protection laws. For years, tenants struggled with unsanitary and poor conditions that left many without heat in winter months. Prosecutors said some residents also lacked working toilets, stoves or refrigerators. They say Sanford refused to fix some broken locks and didn’t maintain fire extinguishers, a move made even more dangerous by missing or broken smoke detectors.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s light and bright in all the merriest of ways at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom this holiday season. For the first time since the park opened in 1998, there’ll be holiday-themed entertainment and decor throughout the 500-acre park, with twinklers lining rooftops and other new seasonal touches at the park, now Central Florida’s second most popular theme park, behind Magic Kingdom. At DinoLand, Donald’s Dino-Bash, the dance party is complemented by holiday decorations chosen by Donald Duck’s pals, with all kinds of holiday merch available for sale at the gift shop. Diwali, India’s festival of lights, is celebrated over in Asia, while in Africa, African celebrations blend with Western traditions, making a stroll through Harame for food and shopping a colorful mix of tastes and treats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock downtown ahead of a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park. The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000. CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone, not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it. The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely. The Democratic debate will be Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man was surfing with his girlfriend when – instead of hanging 10 – he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reports Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment. Luckily, he had a spare. Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Brigham Young University-Idaho has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage, forcing full-time students to buy a university-backed plan. University officials say health plans could be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family. Officials say a student form used to opt out of the school health plan was updated this month reflecting the change in policy. Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1. State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state. Students say a reason for the change has not been disclosed. Some students argue the plan is expensive and has limited coverage. The university declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A copy of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address that was handwritten by the 16th president himself is going on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum for two weeks. In a news release, the museum says it will display the copy – one of only five surviving copies written by Lincoln – from Thursday through Dec. 2. The display coincides with the anniversary of Lincoln’s delivery of the brief speech Nov. 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. The document that stays in a climate-controlled space most of the time to protect it from light and humidity will be housed in the museum’s Treasures Gallery. The address that begins famously with the words: “Four score and seven years ago … ” is handwritten on plain white paper.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb isn’t promising any quick action on the call for further boosting teacher pay that thousands of educators will be making at the Statehouse next week. Teacher unions say at least 107 school districts with more than 40% of Indiana’s students will be closed Tuesday while their teachers attend the rally. Holcomb didn’t criticize school districts for closing the day of the union-organized rally, saying it was a local decision. The Republican governor said Thursday that he applauds teachers for expressing their concerns, but he’s waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed to make recommendations by the end of next year. The rally dubbed “Red for Ed Action Day” will happen on the day legislators are gathering for organization meetings ahead of their 2020 session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse has a new home downtown. The haunted attraction, which has become a staple in Iowa, has begun moving to the old Bank of America building. To break in the new digs, set to open fully next September, Slaughterhouse will host a Krampus Krawl. The event will begin Dec. 7 with an all-age photo op before the crawl to four Full Court Press establishments. Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as “half-goat, half-demon” in Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore. During the Christmas season, Krampus punishes children who have misbehaved, as opposed to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved children with gifts. Tickets are available online. General admission tickets include a Glow Stein for one free pour at each of the four Full Court Press stops.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has approved a public financing package worth about $35.5 million to subsidize the creation of a medical school. The Wichita Eagle reports the package approved Tuesday will help create a campus for training osteopathic physicians. Called the Kansas Health Science Center, the new school will be built in the former Finney State Office Building. Once the center of state government in Wichita, the building was abandoned in favor of leasing privately owned office space across the city. Plans also call for three other buildings to be transformed – one into student housing, another into a dining hall and culinary center, and the third into a boutique hotel. The bulk of the money for the development will come from tax abatements.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal court is allowing a man to personalize a license plate with the phrase “IM GOD” after a three-year legal battle over the custom engraving. Court documents show Ben Hart, a self-identified atheist, set out to get the Kentucky plate in 2016. But Hart’s request was denied by the state transportation department on the basis it violated antidiscrimination guidelines. News outlets report similar plates had been approved before, including “TRYGOD” and “NOGOD.” Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved to help Hart challenge the decision. In an opinion Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in Frankfort, the judge ruled that “vanity plates” are private speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state had violated Hart’s rights by denying him the plate.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A legislative auditor says 18 cities, towns and villages may be close to reaching bankruptcy or may have the inability to provide basic services to residents in the future based on the municipalities’ most recent financial information. The Monroe News Star reports Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera compiled a list of “fiscally distressed municipalities” and added it the auditor’s website. The municipalities range from small villages like Epps in northeastern Louisiana to larger towns like Winnsboro in central Louisiana. Purpera says the list is a way to alert the public and officials of the problems so they can be easily addressed. The list includes concerns for each municipality, including incomplete or inaccurate financial information, insufficient utility rates, debt and rural water infrastructure problems.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: The town wants the Navy to protect the clam flats as part of its remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The Harpswell Conservation Commission has argued the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former Navy base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove should be extended. The commission told the environmental coordinator for the closure process that the Navy has an obligation to investigate the impact of the stormwater system. The Times Record reports that an investigation of the pond system had found several heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium that could potentially reach nearby clam flats. Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster, says the Harpswell side of the Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has reached 300 homicides in a year for the fifth year in a row. Detective Donny Moses told WBAL-AM the total reached 300 Thursday morning with the shooting deaths of a man and a woman. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is on track to see one of its most violent years on record. The city recorded 309 homicides last year and 342 the year before. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young addressed the homicide rate at a news conference Wednesday. He said the city is working to reduce the crime rate, and leaders aren’t to blame. Young took over as mayor this spring after Democrat Catherine Pugh resigned amid investigations into her business dealings. He’s running for reelection in 2020 against a dozen challengers, some of whom criticized his comments Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSudbury: The Sky Bar, the multiflavored chocolate bar divided into four sections, is back on the market after a yearlong hiatus. The Boston Globe reports that production of the confection has resumed at a suburban gourmet shop less than a year after the owner bought rights to the brand in an online auction. The Sky Bar made its debut in 1938 but was discontinued last year when the New England Confectionery Co., also known as Necco, went out of business. Louise Mawhinney, owner of Duck Soup in Sudbury, bought the rights to the Sky Bar in January. The candy bar, divided into caramel, vanilla, peanut and fudge sections, is available in the store and online for $1.98. After the holidays, Mawhinney plans to get a wholesale license and ramp up operations.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A museum at a former southern Michigan prison is closing at the end of December. Cell Block 7 in Jackson allows visitors to step into the cells and walk the corridors of what was once the largest walled institution in the world. The museum’s website invites people to “spend some time on the inside” during a self-guided tour. The museum opened five years ago under an agreement between the state of Michigan and the Ella Sharp Museum, also in Jackson. Ella Sharp director Diane Gutenkauf says the costs are too high. Gutenkauf says some artifacts from the prison museum will be available at the Sharp museum, including oral histories of people who worked there or were inmates. The last day at the prison museum will be Dec. 29.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The battle over the name of a popular Minneapolis lake has landed before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justices heard arguments Wednesday on whether the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to change the name of Lake Calhoun to its original Dakota name, Bde Maka Ska. The state Court of Appeals ruled in April that the agency overstepped its authority in January 2018 when it changed the name. It said authority to change the name rested with the Legislature under statutes governing lake and other place names. KARE-TV reports Save Lake Calhoun attorney Erick Kaardal argued the legislature enacted a policy that says lake names that have been used more than 40 years cannot be changed without lawmakers granting additional authority. It could take the court months to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nRolling Fork: The state is naming a stretch of land in the south Delta in honor of the two-term governor who is leaving office in January. Officials gathered Wednesday to dedicate the Phil Bryant Wildlife Management Area. The 18,000-acre site in Warren and Issaquena counties is made up of bayous, cypress sloughs and bottomland hardwoods. Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Director Sam Polles says the area is divided into four tracts that will offer different types of hunting, including group hunts in a primitive setting. The department worked with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to buy the land in 2018 from Anderson-Tully Company. Republican Bryant said during the dedication ceremony that he looks forward to bringing his grandchildren hunting on the land.\n\nMissouri\n\nJackson: A rescued puppy is attracting a lot of attention because of his resemblance to a unicorn. The nearly 10-week-old puppy, named Narwhal, has a tail-like appendage growing from his forehead. Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs. Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it. Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fish hatchery will be locked at night and begin using security cameras after vandals mutilated several fish. The Montana Standard reports the perpetrators killed about 20 rainbow trout, broke windows and tossed items into water channels at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the Oct. 27 vandalism at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facility about 88 miles southeast of Butte. Sheriff Phil Fortner says a witness saw a yellow ATV near the hatchery, but no suspects have been identified. Hatchery Manager Ron Hopper says the fish were cut with garden hoes, ice choppers or other tools. Hopper says that for the previous 80 years, the hatchery was left unlocked for after-hours visitors.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Transportation Department is offering to produce and emplace roadside memorials as a way to keep highways free of roadside safety hazards. The new departmental policy announced Wednesday says each sign will display the name of the person being memorialized and include one of five safety messages: “Please Drive Safely,” “Seat Belts Save Lives,” “Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Don’t Text and Drive” or “Don’t Drive Impaired.” The sign will be placed as near to the accident site as possible. Family members who have placed private memorials alongside state highways are encouraged to contact their local department offices to discuss disposition of the memorials and get information on the state installing new signs. The department’s Jeni Campana says the state-produced signs would be of a familiar design and would pose less of a safety hazard than the irregular appearance of private memorials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elon Musk’s Boring Co. will begin drilling an underground tunnel Friday for the Las Vegas Convention Center’s forthcoming people mover. To officially kick off the tunneling phase of the company’s first commercial project, the boring machine will be turned on 40 feet below ground. The $52.5 million underground people mover will allow convention attendees to travel the expanse of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s 200-acre campus in approximately one minute, according to officials. The transportation system will include three passenger stations that connect the convention center’s 3.2 million-square-foot space with the 1.4 million-square-foot West hall that is now under construction. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials say plans call for the expansion project to be completed by January 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: After facing criticism over its prior annual holiday celebrations, the town is making some tweaks, planning a “Frost Fest” without a tree-lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa. WMUR-TV reports in past years Durham’s held a tree-lighting ceremony. But after some concerns that the event was too focused on Christmas, a working group was formed to make changes, such as not hanging wreaths on light posts. The Frost Fest is billed as a “winter celebration” with a bonfire, cookie decorating, ice sculpting, crafts and activities. Last year, town officials were under fire for denying a menorah to be displayed next to the tree decorated annually at a local park. The officials cited vandalism concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state has drumsticked up a plan to deal with flocks of wild turkeys that are ruffling some feathers in a Jersey Shore neighborhood. And it doesn’t involve them winding up on dinner plates in two weeks. The state Department of Environmental Protection will trap scores of turkeys that have descended on a retirement community in Toms River and relocate them. The move comes as some residents say large flocks of turkeys have invaded the area, pecking at cars – and at some people who venture too close. Others say they give the birds a wide berth and haven’t experienced any problems. Toms River residents who have run a-fowl of the birds include former New York Yankees and Mets baseball player Todd Frazier, whose SUV was covered by turkeys recently.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal and state officials have reached an agreement they say will strengthen their relationship as they work to improve forest conditions in the state. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen signed the so-called shared stewardship agreement during a gathering Thursday in Santa Fe. The agreement has been a work in progress over years and will address issues such as wildfires, drought and invasive species. Officials say the challenges faced by land managers transcend boundaries and affect people beyond the jurisdiction of any single organization, so they have to find new ways of working together and doing business at a greater pace and scale. Under the agreement, the state and national forests plan to evaluate opportunities, threats and alternatives for risk management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It’s an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation’s largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city’s youth. The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years­long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles’ fingerprints. Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday that it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely. The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: An opossum has illegally taken up residence in the ceiling of a Duke University dorm, where students have been complaining about being bitten by fleas. The school’s assistant vice president of student affairs, Joe Gonzalez, told reporters Wednesday that the school has yet to catch the elusive opossum about which students first complained in October. He says the creature has escaped custody partly because it appears to be splitting its time between the Few Quad dorm and somewhere else. Reports of fleas also began to surface last month, prompting the school to put students up in another dorm while they fumigated the place. Gonzalez says the opossum may have brought the fleas, but that’s unconfirmed. Irritated students are questioning why they’re dealing with such conditions at a $78,608-per-year school.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials have given an estimate on how much oil was spilled from a pipeline leak in Williams County last month. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality says an estimated 12,432 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline operated by Hiland Crude about a mile northeast of McGregor on Oct. 17. The department says the oil leaked onto cropland. Department staff have inspected the site and say they will continue to monitor remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A traveling exhibit celebrating the service and heroism of military working dogs and the sacrifices they make during battle is being displayed at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The exhibit titled “Canine Warriors – Courage and Sacrifice, Always Beside You” features wooden sculptures of eight Wounded Warrior Dogs and four Canine War Dogs and is now on display at the museum in Dayton. Ohio craftsman James Mellick designed the exhibit to be symbolic of the wounds suffered by military dogs in battle and to raise awareness of their needs. The exhibit also features art depicting working military dogs from the Air Force Art Program. It will remain at the museum through Jan. 31.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: District attorneys are raising concerns about a proposed new ballot measure aimed at further reducing the state’s prison population. In a statement late Tuesday, Oklahoma District Attorneys Association President Jason Hicks says one problem is that crimes like child trafficking, aggravated assault and battery, and domestic abuse aren’t technically violent crimes under state law. The proposed state question filed Tuesday would prohibit prosecutors from using previous nonviolent felony convictions to enhance prison sentences. Hicks says state prosecutors are still examining the proposal, but there are already elements that would be “detrimental, if not catastrophic, for public safety.” District Attorney Angela Marsee says ignoring past convictions of repeat offenders is “detrimental to our mission.”\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Traditional Christmas feasts featuring Dungeness crab may not be in the cards this year, as officials have delayed the commercial crabbing season due to the small size of the crustaceans. The Mail Tribune reports the season had been set to start Dec. 1 for Oregon’s most lucrative commercial fishery, but now crabbing has been postponed until at least Dec. 16. It’s the sixth straight year the season has been delayed to allow the crabs a chance to fatten up to meet industry standards. Dungeness crabs off the coasts of Washington and California also have low meat levels in their shells, prompting similar delays in those states. Tests planned for late November or early December will determine whether commercial crabbers can start plying the Pacific beginning Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The FBI has begun a corruption investigation into how Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration came to issue permits for construction on a multibillion-dollar pipeline project to carry highly volatile natural gas liquids across the state. FBI agents have interviewed current or former state employees in recent weeks about the Mariner East project and the construction permits, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus of the agents’ questions involves the permitting of the pipeline, whether Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits, and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, those people say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal judge has sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls after they challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said in a ruling Thursday that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. Attorneys for the cities said in a statement that they are pleased the court “found DOJ’s attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Bars throughout downtown in this college town are now signed on to the Angel Shot program, offering patrons a way to request help when they don’t feel safe. The simple order – “one Angel Shot, please” – is meant to be a simple solution to combat sexual violence and assault in the university’s entertainment district. An “Angel Shot” is not an actual drink. It is a code word that signals to a bartender or barback that a customer feels unsafe, typically from a potential perpetrator of sexual violence. From there, the bar’s staff will find that customer safe passage out of the bar and home. The Angel Shot program was implemented in every bar downtown this fall semester by Clemson University Student Government, which partnered with Pickens County Advocacy Center, Clemson City Police Department and Clemson’s Healthy Campus for the initiative.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A man sentenced to 90 years in prison for killing his stepfather has petitioned the court in Minnehaha County to change his name because he wants a fresh start. Thirty-five-year-old Daniel Charles was 14 when he was sent to prison in 2000 for first-degree murder in Meade County. He was accused of putting a rifle to his stepfather’s head and pulling the trigger at a ranch near Opal. He told law enforcement at the time that he didn’t know the gun was loaded. Charles’ petition says he wants to change his name to Rameus Tiberius Aryada to start a new life with an adult identity. The South Dakota Department of Corrections lists Charles’ earliest parole eligibility as March 2045.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public. The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website. Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families. Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries and community groups.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: With help from Nueces County Public Libraries, county Judge Barbara Canales led local students on a “bear hunt” at Oscar O. Ortiz Park on Wednesday evening. Despite the biting cold, Canales gamely led the students down a path to read from “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen. The county unveiled StoryWalk, a new feature at the park in which pages of picture books are displayed in wooden stands along paths so residents can read while they walk. It’s an effort to promote literacy and physical activity, and the county plans to implement StoryWalk at more parks. Canales and the kids read aloud together as the characters braved tall grass, a deep river, a forest and mud along their search for a bear. Canales called out to the students to stomp in big strides, run and tip-toe like the characters to bring the story to life.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Thursday announced his 2020 candidacy for the Republican nomination for the office that he held from 2005 to 2009 before leaving to serve as a U.S. ambassador. Huntsman announced his candidacy in a statement before a scheduled kickoff swing Thursday and Friday to Cedar City and St. George in southern Utah. Incumbent Republican Gov. Gary Herbert is not running for reelection, and Huntsman has said he was considering a run for governor. Huntsman served as U.S. ambassador to China in the Obama administration and as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Trump administration. Other Republicans in the 2020 race include Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, Utah County businessman Jeff Burningham and Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Five groups are sharing more than $1 million to use phosphorus recovery technologies as the state works to reduce algae-causing phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain and other waterways. It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in the state. Officials estimate about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land. Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday that the state received 21 applicants for the funds. The finalists include Agrilab Technologies of Enosburg Falls. The governor’s office says the group will use existing phosphorus recovery technologies, composting and drying equipment to create a series of sites for phosphorus processing in Franklin, Addison, Lamoille and Caledonia counties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A task force has been created to come up with ways to help mitigate and prevent evictions in the city. The group will include affordable housing and social justice advocates, youth and family homelessness specialists, public housing residents and property management professionals. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a news release that the group will work with the city’s Eviction Diversion Program, which began last month to provide rental assistance, free legal help, financial counseling and supportive service referrals to residents who are facing eviction. Stoney said the task force will explore steps the city can take to better understand the root causes of evictions. A research group at Princeton University found that Richmond and four other Virginia cities have some of the highest eviction rates in the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A weeklong hearing will help determine whether a small American Indian tribe from the northwest corner of Washington state can once again hunt whales. The Makah Tribe conducted its last legal hunt in 1999, when its crew harpooned a gray whale from a cedar canoe. A U.S. appeals court later revoked permission for the hunts, saying the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The tribe has been trying to obtain the waiver since 2005, a process that has been repeatedly stalled by scientific reviews. The hearing beginning Thursday will focus on whether the tribe meets the requirements for the waiver. Animal rights groups oppose the effort. Whatever the outcome, the matter is likely to end up in federal court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Board of Education will give the public 60 days to comment on a proposal on charter schools, double the normal allotted time. The board put the policy proposal up for comment Thursday. Legislation signed by Gov. Jim Justice authorizes a staggered implementation of public charter schools, limiting the state to three charters until 2023, then three more every three years after that. The legislation was part of a broader education bill that included teacher pay raises. The West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia chapter of the American Federation of Teachers have lambasted the bill, saying it shut out teachers’ voices and violates the state Constitution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is asking the Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee to release $3.7 million a year in funding to pay for programs designed to help homeless people. Evers sent a letter Thursday to the committee cochairs, urging them to make available the funding that has been pending for four months. Evers is seeking action now before winter sets in. He says with cold temperatures and snow across the state already, “my concern has only grown.” The funding would go toward such things as grants to help low-income people with housing costs, help fund emergency shelters and pay for support to help homeless people get into permanent housing. The Assembly passed bills to approve the funding, but they’ve stalled in the Senate.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The National Park Service says snowy weather last month likely cut down on visitors to Yellowstone during October. The agency recorded just over 170,000 visitors during the month, a 22% decrease from October 2018. So far in 2019, the park has hosted over 3.9 million visitors, which is down 2.5% from the same period last year. Yellowstone is entering its winter season, when visits to the park are typically the lowest of the year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/11/invasive-species-in-florida/72119813007/", "title": "Florida's next invasive species threat is a crab-eating monkey: Report", "text": "Florida has at least 40 more invasive species to worry about with some unexpected creatures topping the list, according to a recent \"horizon-scanning study.\"\n\nLed by University of Florida scientists, the study assessed 460 species that had not yet been recorded in Florida for their potential harm should they be introduced.\n\nThe state is already known for an infestation of Burmese pythons, which have caused such devastation in the Everglades that the state will pay you to hunt them. The study hopes to get ahead of those devastating effects by identifying ecological threats for conservation officials.\n\nAmong the species identified as the most likely invaders were the alewife, zebra mussel and red swamp crayfish. All species studied were ranked based on the likeliness they could arrive, the likeliness they could spread and establish, and the severity of their impact on the surrounding ecology if they did, according to Deah Lieurance, a co-author of the study.\n\nThe fourth species that topped the list surprised even Lieurance: the crab-eating macaque, a type of monkey.\n\n\"Looking at the potential impacts, you know, that's what really alarmed me,\" Lieurance said in an interview last week. She explained, in addition to ecological damage, they could have a human-impact as well. The species' relative the Rhesus macaque is already established in Florida and carries a deadly strain of herpes that the crab-eating macaque could become carriers for. Further, the crab-eating macaque are already in the state for biological testing.\n\n\"Say there's a, you know, Category Five hurricane that might breach wherever they're being held captive,\" Lieurance said. \"There could be a potential introduction there.\"\n\nFlorida a hotbed for invasive species\n\nIn a UF blog post about the study, director of the UF/IFAS Invasion Science Research Initiative Matthew Thomas called Florida \"ground-zero\" for invasions in the U.S.\n\nLieurance attributes this to the following factors:\n\nFlorida has 35 international ports of entry\n\n120 million tourists visit Florida every year\n\n85% of all nonnative plant species that arrive in the U.S. do so through Florida\n\nFlorida has a tropical, subtropical and temperate climate\n\nThe tropical and subtropical climates overlap with some of the more biodiverse regions in the world\n\nLieurance said Florida, California and Hawaii rank highest for invasive species.\n\nWild Florida monkey adept swimmer carrying deadly strain of herpes\n\nThe rhesus macaque, a relative of the potentially invasive crab-eating macaque, was first recorded in Florida when a commercial river boat captain released them on a river island south of Gainesville to attract more tourists, according to a post by the Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Department, UF/IFAS Extension.\n\nThe monkeys are \"excellent swimmers\" and immediately got to the forest and began breeding, according to UF. Subsequent populations were introduced in the Florida Keys and Titusville from a breeding lab and an amusement park.\n\nAccording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the monkeys in the state have tested positive for herpes B, which can cause severe brain damage or even death. They can also carry rabies.\n\nThe population continued to grow before the monkeys were trapped in a controversial move to control the population, the UF post states.\n\nThe Florida FWC declined to comment further on the current rhesus macaque population and current population control efforts. However, credible sightings are tracked online. There have been 230 reports going back to 1959 with the majority of entries falling between 2007 and November 2023.\n\nCrab-eating macaque live in Florida for animal testing\n\nThe Florida FWC told USA TODAY in an emailed statement that crab-eating macaques are not established in Florida.\n\nHowever, researchers involved with the study confirmed with Lieurance that they are being bread by Primate Products at a facility in Hendry County near Fort Myers. Additional facilities in Labelle (part of Hendry) and Homestead, south of Miami, contain the crab-eating macaque. The Associated Press reported in 2015 that three facilities in Hendry county house thousands of these primates in total.\n\nThe Florida FWC declined an interview on the matter, and did not comment on conservation efforts to prevent the crab-eating macaque from being introduced. Instead, they issued the following statement:\n\n\"Crab-eating macaques are not established in Florida. Monkeys are not native to Florida, and wild populations may have negative impacts on native wildlife, ecosystems and agriculture...If you encounter wild monkeys in Florida, it is important to keep a safe distance and never feed wild monkeys. To help prevent injuries and the spread of disease to people, feeding wild monkeys is illegal in Florida (Rule 68A-4.001). Members of the public can report monkey sightings to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission online at IveGot1.org.\"\n\nStudy identifies 3 other species at high risk for invading\n\nLieurance said many of the species they assessed did not yield enough data to make conservation recommendations on the species.\n\nForty species demonstrated enough risk to be put on a \"watchlist,\" as Lieurance described it, though she still recommended the species receive further individual risk assessments.\n\nThe three that joined the crab-eating macaque in the top ranked for the most likely invaders were:\n\nAlewife - a sleek, silvery species of herring that grows to about 15 inches.\n\nZebra mussel - established in the Great Lakes, they arrived in ballast water released by boats scientists believe. The mussels are an expensive nuisance and hurt the environment.\n\nRed swamp crayfish - lobster-looking creatures\n\nLieurance said looking at potential threats holistically could help make preventative measures more efficient. For example, several other crayfish that were identified on the watchlist share the same pathway into the state. If officials focus on monitoring the pathway, they could monitor several potentially dangerous species at a time.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, invasive species cost the world $423 billion every year. And once an invasive species arrives, humans are already behind in managing them, Lieurance said.\n\n\"We spend about 25 times less on prevention efforts than we do management,\" Lieurance said. \"So that's where this horizon scanning kind of fits in. Not only can we preserve habitat, and biodiversity, but we can also save money.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/04/21/michigan-invasive-species-asian-carp-sea-lamprey-zebra-quagga-mussels/7227536002/", "title": "Michigan's invasive species: How they got here, why they're a problem", "text": "They've changed life in Michigan almost everywhere you look — irrevocably in some cases.\n\nInvasive species cost tens of millions of dollars per year in control efforts in Michigan, and untold millions more in impacts on property values, lost recreational opportunities and damage to roads, ditches, pipes and other infrastructure.

They were all wearing huge smiles and No. 12 or Kelly Tough T-shirts, holding out their hands so he could move through their path of love and support and give them each a high five.\n\nKelly's wife, Jill, filmed the precious life moment from behind to preserve it.\n\nThat scene is as indelible in Kelly's mind as any touchdown pass he ever threw, any heroic last-minute game-winning drive he engineered, or any AFC Championship Game victory celebration he enjoyed with his beloved teammates. It is a moment that will stay with him for the rest of what he hopes is a lengthy life.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting it,\" Kelly said the other day in an exclusive interview with the Democrat and Chronicle, recalling the overwhelming joy and spiritual uplift that act of kindness provided him. \"It was a surprise. It was my last radiation treatment, so I figured go out and get in my car and go home, and I walk out there and they set me up. That was a point that made me feel that people really do care. I mean, I knew that they did, but to have some of those people come out, and not know they would be there, it was nice.\"\n\nFour months have passed since that day when Kelly received the last of 35 radiation treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, which were interspersed throughout his two-month treatment regimen with three chemotherapy treatments to fight the cancer that infested his upper jaw, cheekbone and nasal cavity. In late August, he received the news he was hoping to hear, that all the suffering was worth it and the cancer no longer present. At least for now.\n\nPressing forward\n\nDuring the epoch between hearing that news and that day outside the medical building in Cheektowaga when he gave a tearful, impromptu speech thanking everyone who had come to say goodbye, he did not know what his future held. Yes, the treatments were done, but doctors needed to wait more than two months before they could run tests to determine whether the cancerous cells had been eviscerated. So Kelly did the only thing he knows how to do: He got on with his life, because that's what he has always done, no matter how adverse the situation.\n\nHe showed up at end of the Bills mini-camp and gave the team a pep talk before it broke for pre-training camp vacation. He couldn't make it to his annual charity golf tournament, but he was there for his youth football camp in Buffalo, and the one-day camp he holds at St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, teaching the kids the basics of football, and thanking everyone for their remarkable support.\n\nHe went to Canton to celebrate Andre Reed's Hall of Fame induction, and when he threw one last pass to Reed on the stage inside Fawcett Stadium at the end of Reed's induction speech, it was the highlight of a wonderful weekend. Life has dealt the 54-year-old Kelly some tremendous pain and unimaginable heartache, yet he somehow remains upbeat, even when death was seemingly knocking at his door just a few short months ago.\n\n\"One thing about me that I'm pretty good at is being able to forget things and focus my attention on something else,\" Kelly said Wednesday following his latest visit to the doctor.\n\nWidely considered by anyone who played with him or against him to be the toughest quarterback there ever was, Kelly is no longer the same man physically. He is gaunt, weakened by the loss of 51 pounds, sometimes cloudy because of the side effects that come from radiation and chemotherapy, and hindered by the pain that still occasionally rages inside his head, not to mention the pain he has long dealt with throughout the rest of his body from a lifetime of playing football.\n\nBut this is a man who, despite it all, is now perhaps stronger than he ever was.\n\nKelly Tough?\n\nThe man who coined the phrase and has lived by that credo never truly knew what it meant until this ordeal when, in his darkest moments in a New York City hospital bed, he thought he was going to die.\n\n\"Kelly Tough, to me at the beginning, was being physically strong, being able to bounce back from injury, being able to bounce back from something that some people may not be able to; just tough it out,\" Kelly explained. \"But I found out Kelly Tough is more than just the physical part, it's the mental part. Being mentally tough is probably just as important, if not more important.\"\n\nKelly was originally diagnosed with oral cancer in June 2013. He underwent surgery at Erie County Medical Center to remove his jaw and most of his teeth. Three weeks later he had been fitted with a prosthetic jaw and false teeth. His doctors told him the procedure had eradicated the cancer.\n\nThey were wrong. Several months later, Kelly began to suffer from horrible headaches, and the pain was unlike anything he'd ever experienced. \"Pain has been part of my life,\" he said. \"I don't complain about much. When you grow up with six boys you can't show your pain, and if you do, they'll give you another piece of pain.\"\n\nHe went through bottle after bottle of Advil to manage the discomfort, but it was rarely enough. Finally, in March, he told his brother, Dan, that something had to be wrong. So he went in for tests, and it turned out he was right. The cancer had returned, and it was dangerously aggressive.\n\n\"I've never had a migraine, but I've heard how painful those are, and I can only relate it to that from what people have told me,\" he said. \"It brought tears to my eyes. If I wasn't on medication I wouldn't have been able to handle it, it was that bad.\"\n\nKeeping the faith\n\nThe news was devastating. How much could one man, one family endure? Jim and Jill had watched their son, Hunter, suffer every day of the remarkable 8 1/2 years he lived before finally succumbing to Krabbe disease in August 2005. And now the Lord that they have given their life to was testing them again.\n\n\"I think our family has already experienced the most traumatic thing,\" said Jill, a magnificently strong and resilient woman who turned 45 last week. \"What we went through with Hunter and his life, and his going to heaven, that entire experience of losing a child and watching him suffer every day of his life, that was so traumatic. So this, although it was very, very, very difficult, we've been through so much already that it was just another thing to face. It's not even a 'Why, God?' question, it's a 'How, God?' How do we get through this?\"\n\nThe answer to Jim and Jill was simple: Have faith, and they have an abundance of it.\n\nJill became a Christian shortly after Hunter was diagnosed with his fatal neurological disease just four months after his Valentine's Day 1997 birth, which happened to be Jim's 37th birthday. It took a while for Jim to join her.\n\nMuch has been documented in the book Jill wrote in 2010, Without A Word, about the marital troubles the couple had and the incredible heartache they suffered throughout Hunter's struggle. Jim did not want to share specifics — it's there to read — but in explaining his decision to become a Christian in 2009, he simply said that he realized he was not the man he wanted to be, and he had to stop hurting Jill and his daughters.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure after I was out of town, I could walk through my front door and (my girls could) look at their daddy with respect,\" he said. \"I knew I was losing a lot of that and as a father, you need to accept that responsibility for your kids. And I wanted to make sure that I will see Hunter again, hopefully later than sooner; I was losing all that. I was losing a woman who took care of my son, raising two kids, and I knew I needed to change my life, and thank God I did.\"\n\nA better man\n\nHe looks back at that decision as the definitive turning point of his life. Yes, he was a football hero, the big man on campus, an NFL star whose celebrity transcended the gridiron, a guy who lived a life that many of us would envy. And yet, he learned that he was hollow, a man without a true purpose, until he turned to God.\n\n\"I'm 10 times the man I ever was before, a lot better husband, a lot better father, and a lot better person,\" he said. \"When I decided to become a Christian and decided to change my life and just totally quit screwing up, it was like, 'Wow, why didn't I do this before?' No hiding anything, I just felt so much better, not only about myself, but my future, my family. It was awesome, and it didn't take me long to realize that.\"\n\nWithout his faith, the fight for his life that he is now engaged in would have been so much more difficult.\n\n\"Little did I know how brutally he would be attacked by this disease,\" Jill said. \"He wasn't going to pull this off with and of his own strength.\"\n\nKelly began his stay at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City in early April. He was there for six weeks, and when he went back to Buffalo — to the Cancer Care center — to complete his treatment, he thought he'd only been in New York a couple of weeks. That's how draining it was.\n\n\"I don't remember some of the people who visited me, I was on so many different medications, I had 8-10 bags hanging around me and those were gloomy, dark days,\" he said. \"Thank God I had family around me, and friends.\"\n\n'I couldn't have done it without her'\n\nMost importantly, he had Jill. If he's the toughest quarterback there ever was, then she's in the running for toughest woman there ever was.\n\n\"I couldn't have done it without her,\" he said. \"She's been through so much. If there's anybody out there who deserves a medal, it's her. Eight and a half years with Hunter, going through the mental part of your son dying in front of you, and all the things that he went through. Then a short period of time after, all the things I'm going through now, she's been a trouper.\"\n\nThe parade of visitors in New York was constant. Family, friends, old teammates such as Andre Reed, Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith and Steve Tasker, even old foes like Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason. But then, when it was time for everyone to leave, and he lay there in that bed alone, those were the toughest moments. So Kelly did what he has always done, whether it was rehabbing an injury, or licking his wounds from one of four straight Super Bowl losses: He tried to think positively, even though the stakes were far more daunting.\n\n\"If I would have laid there in the bed and thought about all the things that were happening to me and that I was dying, yeah, it would have been tough. But I tried not to. I tried to think of positive things, or I'd watch hunting shows, just to keep my mind off of what I was going through and what my family was going through. How do I turn that negative into a positive? How do I get people around me to think positive? I've always been good at refocusing my attention away from something that was bringing me down.\"\n\nThe pain remains. His strength wavers, depending on the day. There is still concern because with cancer, he said, \"There's always a but.\" But his spirits are good, and Sunday, he will do what he has always done since showing up in Buffalo in 1986 as the cockiest damn quarterback the city had ever seen, hellbent on bringing a championship to a fan base that was starved for one: He'll be at Ralph Wilson Stadium, watching his beloved Bills take on those hated Miami Dolphins.\n\nThrough all that he's been through, his life is vivid, it's rich, it's rewarding, and it's filled with people who love him deeply — and that's not just his family, but his old teammates, coaches, and fans across western New York and even the country.\n\nHe knows only God knows what's in store for his future, and he's prepared to accept whatever the verdict will be. But rest assured, he's not ready for his life to end, and he's going to fight the same way he always has.\n\n\"I still have a lot more things to go through, I'm not out of the dark by any means, but it's a step in the right direction,\" he said of his latest victory over cancer. \"I just take it day by day and I hope one day I can say I feel good, not just be cancer free, but just feel good. I'm just living every day to the fullest, I enjoy myself, I have fun, and I pray every day that it doesn't come back.\"\n\nA shared struggle\n\nAs he did during his career, Jim Kelly had fans during his disease.\n\nMembers of an oral, head and neck cancer support group at the UR Medicine Wilmot Cancer Institute sent the former quarterback a card during his recovery. Individuals wrote their own messages and signed their names.\n\nRita Goodman, a social worker with the Wilmot Cancer Institute, said that seeing a famous person dealing with cancer helps others, particularly those with the same form.\n\n\"It promotes awareness,\" she said. \"He had oral, head and neck cancer. That diagnosis is not commonly talked about in the community. It just brings that to the forefront for other patients and survivors in regard to it can affect anybody.\"\n\nGoodman said members of the group talked about Kelly's battle. \"Not only did survivors themselves identify with him, the caregivers identified with his wife and what she's going through as well.\"\n\nGoodman said that cancer or any serious illness has a way of leveling the playing field between those who are famous and those known only to their family and friends.\n\n\"When he finished his treatment, I talked about it with patients,\" she said. \"It really lifted their spirits that he was able to be successful. They recognized the disease didn't take ahold of him. He was able to control his life.\"\n\nShe gave his post-treatment public appearances as examples. \"It demonstrates to other people going through treatment and who have been through treatment that there is more to look forward to in life.\"\n\n— Patti Singer\n\nSteve Tasker remembered going to visit Jim Kelly during his hospital stay in New York City, and the thought that stuck with him as he looked at his dear, suffering friend was, \"He went from being Jim Kelly to being a cancer patient.\"\n\nIt was jarring, to say the least, seeing the once-vibrant Kelly laying there in that bed, so weak, so vulnerable, hooked up to tubes, his face contorted in pain, medicated to the point where it was tough to communicate.\n\n\"It's pretty rough,\" Tasker said. \"We all know him as being Jim, and his public persona, but you go through that treatment and it knocks the crap out of you.\"\n\nNot everyone who knows Jim, or cares about him, or is just a fan of his, could visit him. So Jim's wife, Jill, brought him to us using social media. She continually posted updates on her Facebook page and Twitter account, and sent out photos and videos of Jim sharing moments with his daughters Erin and Camryn, or welcoming ex-teammates for visits, because she wanted people to know what Jim was going through, and how he was dealing with it.\n\nWhy, you wonder, would Kelly's wife want to open the door on such a terrible time in his life and reveal so many of the details of his life-threatening battle with oral cancer?\n\nThree reasons:\n\nShe wanted everyone to remember where he was so that they could pray for Jim. \"In sharing, I was in awe by how people rallied in prayer and it wasn't just Bills fans, or people we met through Hunter's Hope (the Kelly's foundation named in honor of their late son). We're talking like Dolphins fans, the Saints and Packers team sending videos, and just the NFL in general.\"\n\nShe wanted a detailed record of everything he went through so their family could look back and remember. \"I wanted to be able to remind him, do you remember what you went through and how God pulled you through? You can't forget that you've walked through this.\"\n\nAnd, she wanted others who are suffering from cancer or any disease to draw strength from Jim's tough-minded fighting spirit. \"We're going to be able to encourage someone who has to go through it,\" she said. \"I felt it was very important to share moments of adversity, and our trials, to encourage someone else.\"\n\nJill admitted that at first, Jim was not thrilled that she was going to be sharing so much, but he eventually came to understand Jill's strategic reasons for doing so.\n\n\"Jim struggled with this at the beginning; he didn't want anyone to know the details,\" she said. \"But we weren't mindless when we shared things. We believe that we were very strategic with how we shared what Jim was going through.\"\n\nSome of the pictures were sad, Jim appearing to be in so much discomfort. Others were poignant, such as the ones where Erin and Camryn would snuggle with him in his hospital bed. Others were uplifting because you could see his spirit rise when Thurman Thomas or Andre Reed or Dan Marino would come to visit.\n\nJill's work behind the video camera also resulted in a wonderfully executed mini-documentary about his fight that aired on ESPN Aug. 3, the morning after Reed was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nJill gave ESPN much of the video that she shot of Jim receiving treatment, seeing friends, spending tender moments with the girls, and if you saw the final product, you may have cried your eyes out. At the very least, you dabbed them.\n\nJim looks back on those weeks when he was vomiting almost every day, was being fed through a tube in his stomach, wondering if he was going to walk out of the hospital alive, and he can't thank enough the people who, as Jill said, fed him with encouragement.\n\n\"I was blessed to have friends and family come see me, but there were people in the hospital who hadn't had anyone see them for a week and a half, and that's what makes you appreciate what I have, the people I have,\" Jim said. \"And not only the people who came to see me, but the cards, the emails, the letters I got from all around the country, those are things that kept me smiling.\"\n\nJill looks back on those weeks, and she is convinced that pulling back the veil of privacy was the right thing to do because she saw in Jim's eyes what it meant to him knowing everyone was pulling for him.\n\n\"Jim has always been touted as tough, and he is,\" she said. \"But you find out in a situation like this that you're weak, too, and you can find strength in God. That's humbling, and this has been very humbling. He got to a point where he didn't think he was going to pull this off, and it was going to have to be God and people around him praying him through and feeding him. He had to rely on others, and that's hard for a man in general, but for Jim, it has made him stronger.\"\n\nFrom a very young age, when Jim Kelly was first formulating his dream of someday becoming a National Football League star, he recognized one thing about his hometown of East Brady, Pa.\n\n\"Basically, what you do in East Brady - although I'm proud to claim it as my hometown - is try to make a better life for yourself,\" Kelly once said.\n\nSo Kelly did, and now he is the most famous person to have ever called East Brady home, and there likely won't be anyone who comes along to bump him off the mountain.\n\nThe town sits along the Allegheny River, some 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. There aren't -- nor were there ever -- stop lights in East Brady, just stop signs. If you wanted to grab a burger at McDonalds, that was a 30-mile ride. Shopping at a mall? Twenty-five miles.\n\nIn East Brady, you made do with what you had, and in the Kelly household -- where Joe and Alice Kelly raised six sons -- there was an abundant supply of love and not much in the way of materialism. Joe Kelly grew up in an orphanage, raised by nuns after his parents had both passed away by the time he was 2. He joined the Navy when he was 17, did a four-year hitch, then came home, met Alice McGinn, married her, and they moved to East Brady to start their family.\n\nJoe worked as a machinist at Daman Industries, and he did odd jobs around town such as carpentry work because feeding six rambunctious boys created a hefty grocery bill.\n\nAlice Kelly maintained the house. Saint Alice they called her, taking care of those boys - oldest to youngest, Pat, Ed, Ray, Jim, and twins Kevin and Danny. In a town where Iron City beer was consumed like water, there was nothing quite like the Kelly six-pack. \"We managed to bring her to tears two or three times a week,\" Kelly wrote in his autobiography, Armed and Dangerous. \"It's a wonder she didn't have a nervous breakdown. She always tells people now, 'I wouldn't trade my boys for the world, but there were days I would have gladly given them away.'\"\n\nJim played every sport you could imagine as a kid, and some that a few of the boys from East Brady invented, like jumping off a steel bridge into the Allegheny. From the top, it was 75 feet to the water, which was about 20 feet deep. The winner was the kid who not only survived, but entered the water with the least amount of splash. \"Not the smartest thing we've ever done,\" Kelly said.\n\nBy the time he was 7 or 8, Jim was enamored with a far less dangerous pursuit -- football. He played in the county midget league, and when Joe realized the kid had some talent, he became his de facto coach. Jim would come home from school for lunch, and Joe -- also on his lunch break -- had him outside throwing footballs through a tire, and punting and kicking. When Joe was satisfied, then Jim could gobble down a couple of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, his favorite food.\n\n\"All my boys were good athletes, but there was something special about Jimmy,'' Joe Kelly once said. \"He had a gift and I didn't want him to waste it. I told him that nothing comes to you unless you work hard at it and pay a price.\"\n\nWhen Jim was 10, he made it to the national semifinals of the Punt, Pass and Kick competition, and representing his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers, he flew to San Diego -- a world away from East Brady -- where he finished second in his age group.\n\nThe next year, he won the area title again, was invited to Three Rivers Stadium, and there he met his boyhood hero, Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Kelly shook his hand and said, \"I'm going to take your job away, Mr. Bradshaw.\"\n\nWhen Kelly entered East Brady High School, he followed in the footsteps of his three older brothers, and eventually, every Kelly wore the Bulldog uniform -- though not as gloriously as Jim.\n\nThe oldest, Pat, played at the University of Richmond, and made it to the NFL, drafted in the 15th round in 1974 by the Baltimore Colts where he was a backup linebacker, later moving on briefly to the Detroit Lions, with a stop in the World Football League with Birmingham in between. His career ended just as Jim's legendary epoch was closing at East Brady High, and there was little doubt which Kelly brother was going to likely be the most successful pro.\n\nThe Bulldogs went 26-2-1 during Jim's time playing quarterback, punter, placekicker and various positions on defense. Wearing No. 11 -- which the school later retired -- Jim led the team to one conference championship, a share of another, and threw for 3,915 yards and 44 touchdowns. He was an all-state selection as a senior, and became the first player in his conference's history to be chosen to play in Pennsylvania's iconic Big 33 state all-star game.\n\nFun Fact\n\nJim Kelly's hometown of East Brady, Pa., is named after Captain Samuel Brady (1756-1795), who fought against Native Americans at that location.\n\nGrowing up in a small town like East Brady, Kelly often worried that no one would ever see him play, and maybe he wouldn't get the opportunity to be offered a scholarship to play football in college. And he knew that without a scholarship, it would be difficult for him to go to college given the Kelly family's financial situation.\n\nIn truth, the only place he really wanted to go was Penn State. He couldn't have cared less if other schools sent recruiters to East Brady; he was only interested in playing for the Nittany Lions of Joe Paterno.\n\nWell, it's a good thing other schools were eager to have Kelly sign a letter of intent, because Paterno broke Jim's heart. On his official visit to campus, he informed Jim that he wasn't being recruited as a quarterback but rather, a linebacker, and as Kelly said, \"it wasn't exactly music to my ears.\"\n\nFor most boys, that wouldn't have been such terrible news. At the time, Penn State was known for its long line of star linebackers, even earning the nickname Linebacker U. It was a badge of honor to carry on that tradition in State College, and several had gone on to play in the NFL, but Kelly -- certainly as tough as any linebacker -- wanted nothing to do with that. He was a quarterback, plain and simple, and that's what he told Joe Pa, thanking the legend for being up front with him before he signed on the dotted line.\n\nPittsburgh knew all about Kelly's quarterbacking skills and coach Jackie Sherrill was prepared to give him a scholarship, but all his life Kelly had been a Penn State fan which meant hating Pitt, and he couldn't put that aside.\n\nSo playing in his home state was out, but thankfully he had other choices, among them football factories like Tennessee and Notre Dame.\n\nIn the end, the University of Miami's Lou Saban -- who had served two stints as coach of the Bills, the first in the mid-1960s when Buffalo won back-to-back AFL championships, the second in the mid-1970s when Saban helped turned O.J. Simpson into a superstar -- won the Kelly sweepstakes.\n\nPhotos: Jim Kelly through the years\n\nSaban personally came to East Brady, braving a terrible snowstorm, to make his pitch. He reminded Jim to look out the window and think about what the weather was like down in South Florida at that very moment. More importantly, Saban told Kelly he'd be quarterbacking a pro-style offense which was predicated on drop-back, pocket passing, not some of the run-oriented offenses that were popular in the late 1970s.\n\nAnother key factor was Saban's contention that Kelly could be the centerpiece of a football revival in Coral Gables. The Hurricanes had been languishing for a decade with just one winning season, but Saban felt Kelly was just the right man to get the program back on track.\n\nKelly verbally committed that day, but soon took his official visit to Tennessee and was blown away by everything in Knoxville. Big-time program, huge stadium where attendance was never down, great campus, and lots of pretty co-eds.\n\nHe was torn until he made his visit to South Florida, and those palm trees, those temperatures, and, yes, even more pretty co-eds, convinced him that Miami was the place to be.\n\nHowever, that first year, fall of 1978, Kelly was thinking he'd made a huge mistake. Saban, come to find out, wasn't running a pro-style offense but a veer which relied heavily on a mobile quarterback primarily handing off, pitching out, or keeping the ball and running. Kelly was furious, though it didn't matter much because he redshirted as a freshman and didn't play. \"Mr. Everything at East Brady to Mr. Nobody at Miami\" is how Kelly described what that felt like.\n\nAfter the 1978 season, Saban -- as Saban was wont to do during his long and nomadic coaching career -- quit Miami to take the job at Army. Kelly wasn't sure if this was a good thing or a bad thing because he really liked Saban, but he wasn't happy with the veer offense, so he considered transferring to Tennessee.\n\nAnd then Miami hired Howard Schnellenberger, most recently the offensive coordinator of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, who brought Earl Morrall, a former NFL quarterback, along with him to tutor Kelly and the other quarterbacks. Kelly knew right then things were going to change for the better.\n\nIt took half the season, but with starter Mike Rodrigue struggling, and the Hurricanes treading water at 3-3, Schnellenberger turned to Kelly during the third quarter of the team's seventh game and told him to get on the field. As it so happened, the Hurricanes were playing Syracuse, and the game was at Kelly's future home, Rich Stadium, because the Orange's new Carrier Dome was under construction back in Syracuse.\n\nThat day Kelly entered a game Miami was losing 25-7 and would ultimately lose 25-15, he threw for 130 yards and one touchdown, and Kelly was never a backup again. The following week he made his first start against none other than Joe Paterno and 19th-ranked Penn State, right there in Happy Valley, and if there was ever a sweeter victory in Kelly's life, good luck finding it.\n\nFun Fact\n\nThough Kelly missed much of his senior season at University of Miami due to a separated shoulder, he finished his career having thrown for 5,228 yards, 376 completions, and 31 touchdowns, then all Miami records, with a mark of 22-8 in games he started.\n\nDid you know?\n\nJim Kelly was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1992 and his name was added to Miami's Ring of Honor in 2008.\n\nBefore Bills fans came to love Jim Kelly, they first hated him.\n\nAfter making the NFL playoffs in 1980 and 1981, the Bills failed to qualify for the postseason tournament in the strike-shortened season of 1982. With two first-round picks in the 1983 draft, though, there was hope the Bills could quickly add some key pieces and get back on track.\n\nThey used the first of those picks, No. 12 overall, on tight end Tony Hunter, a productive player who it was thought would give the Bills a true passing game threat at a position where they'd never really had one. With the second pick, No. 14 overall, they drafted Kelly to be the heir apparent to quarterback Joe Ferguson, who would be entering his 11th NFL season and was nearing the end.\n\nBills fans were ecstatic. Everyone knew the 1983 draft was loaded with potential star quarterbacks led by the likes of Kelly, John Elway and Dan Marino, and the Bills had managed to draft one of them. Sure enough, those three went on to enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nKelly wasn't so ecstatic. In fact, he was miserable. Thus, unlike Elway and Marino, who began their NFL careers later that fall, Kelly defected to the upstart United States Football League because he simply had no desire to ever step foot in Buffalo, let alone play in what was long considered the snow-belt capital of the world.\n\nThe fledgling USFL had opened for business that spring, and the Chicago Blitz had already selected Kelly in the inaugural draft the first week of January. Whereas Kelly was the 14th overall pick of the first round in the NFL, he was picked by Chicago in the 14th round, primarily because it was assumed he'd never agree to play in the league.\n\nSurprise, surprise. When Kelly informed his agents, who were somewhat shocked, that he would consider playing in the USFL if the money was right, they went to work and came up with a dandy of a deal.\n\nWith an offer of $2.1 million over four years on the table from the Bills -- nothing to sneeze at back then -- Kelly was prepared to suck it up and sign. But on the day he was in team president Patrick McGroder's office ready to do so, Bruce Allen -- son of former NFL coach George Allen, who was now the general manager of the Blitz -- called One Bills Drive asking to speak to Kelly. Not knowing how damaging it would be to the immediate future of the Bills, the unknowing secretary put the call through, and when Kelly and his agents heard what was on the table, they walked out of McGroder's office and told him they'd get back to him.\n\nKelly never did.\n\nThe USFL was so desperate to get stars like Kelly into the league that Allen said he would gladly give up his rights to Kelly, and allow the quarterback to pick the team he wanted to play for.\n\nTampa Bay looked inviting, so did Jacksonville, and so did Houston, even though that franchise wouldn't start playing until the 1984 season, which meant sitting out 1983. Kelly flew down to meet with Gamblers owner Jerry Argovitz, and he was blown away by the offer -- $3.5 million over five years, with $1 million up front guaranteed.\n\nThat was that. Kelly was going to Houston, Buffalo was soon on its way to back-to-back 2-14 seasons, and if Kelly ever ventured into Erie County, he'd probably be wise to bring a few bodyguards with him.\n\nDid you know?\n\nTony Hunter, the player chosen two picks ahead of Kelly, played two seasons with Buffalo. He caught 69 passes, including five touchdowns, in 24 games before being traded to the Rams in 1985 for quarterback Vince Ferragamo and a third-round draft choice.\n\nIn 1984, his second year in the NFL, Dan Marino put together one of the greatest seasons by a quarterback in NFL history in leading the Miami Dolphins to the AFC championship. Marino became the first to top 5,000 yards in one season, a feat no one accomplished again until Drew Brees in 2008. Marino also threw a record 48 touchdown passes, a standard that stood until Peyton Manning threw one more in 2004, and still ranks as the fourth-highest total of all time.\n\nAll of that rendered what Kelly was doing in the USFL largely irrelevant, even though his numbers were even more staggering, because try as they may, the USFL could never compete with the NFL for the nation's attention. Even in a nation that was starved for football.\n\nIn his first professional season, Kelly guided the expansion Houston Gamblers to first place in their division with a 13-5 record, and on his way to winning both the rookie of the year and league MVP awards, he completed 370 passes for 5,219 yards (which remained the highest total in pro football history until 2011, when both Brees and Tom Brady surpassed it) and 44 touchdowns, all USFL records that were never broken.\n\nThe following year, Kelly sat out the final four regular-season games with a knee injury, but still managed to lead the league in yards passing (4,623), completions (360) and touchdowns (39) while authoring what remains the most prolific single game in pro history, a 574-yard, five-touchdown performance against Steve Young and the Los Angeles Express. That yardage total broke the still-standing NFL record of 554 passing yards set by Norm Van Brocklin in 1950.\n\nIt's true that Kelly was playing in an offensive system -- the run-and-shoot which was later made popular in the NFL by Warren Moon and the Houston Oilers -- that was pass first, pass second, and usually pass third. Further, Kelly wasn't going against NFL defenses. There were many excellent players in the USFL who, like Kelly, migrated to the NFL, but top to bottom the rosters weren't nearly as talented, so a player of Kelly's stature could dominate.\n\nStill, Kelly was brilliant, and if they were paying attention -- and you know they were -- Bills fans were seething. During the 1984 and '85 seasons when Kelly was putting up pinball-type numbers, Bills fans were stuck watching in horror the likes of an aging Ferguson, and then Joe Dufek, Matt Kofler, Vince Ferragamo and Bruce Mathison combine for 6,583 yards passing with 27 touchdowns and 61 interceptions as the Bills won four of 32 games.\n\nIt was during the 1985 season, though, that Bills fans were offered a glimmer of hope. Thinking they had established a footprint on the sports landscape, the USFL owners made a decision that to this day can only be termed calamitous. They voted to scrap their spring schedule in 1986 and go head-to-head with the all-powerful NFL in the fall. Also, they announced they were filing an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL. In effect, this served as a one-two knockout punch that ended the USFL's outlaw existence.\n\nWhen a judge ruled in favor of the USFL at trial, but awarded the league just $1 in damages -- trebled to $3 -- the league folded, and just like that all of those players were looking for work, hopefully in the NFL. As for Kelly, per NFL rules, the Bills still had a grip on negotiating rights, and it didn't take long for Kelly to realize it was time to get over his displeasure for playing in the cold weather and sign up to become the savior of a floundering franchise.\n\nForgive and forget? You betcha. As soon as news broke that Kelly was coming to Buffalo -- for $8 million over five years, then the richest contract in NFL history -- Bills fans suddenly developed a case of amnesia. They welcomed Kelly to town in such a profoundly enthusiastic way that he has never forgotten it, and a love affair between player and city was born.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Kelly recalled years later. \"Not really knowing how people were going to accept me, to a certain point you knew they were excited because they did need a winner here, they needed to start somewhere.\"\n\nThere were fans on virtually all of the overpasses across the Kensington Expressway that took Kelly from the Buffalo airport to a downtown hotel for a press conference the size and scope of which the city had never seen.\n\n\"I'm not sure the pope would have got the welcome he got,\" said the late Kent Hull, a USFL refugee who signed with the Bills the same day Kelly did under far less glamorous circumstances and was Kelly's center all 11 years they played together in Buffalo. \"He brought the franchise out of the gutter. At the time that he came to Buffalo, they were needing a central figure to rally around, everybody, and here comes the savior. He really personified the whole franchise, the whole town. Buffalo was a steel town, half of it was shut down, and he came in there and wasn't very successful the first year, but he had enough of that cockiness and arrogance running around in there, and then he got some people around him. All of a sudden we're confident, now I'm going to show you something, and he did.\"\n\nDid you know?\n\nKelly appeared on the July 21, 1986 cover of Sports Illustrated wearing a New Jersey Generals uniform. The headline read, \"Look out Marino, Montana and Fouts: The USFL's Jim Kelly is ready to prove he's pro football's top gun.\" Kelly signed with the Bills less than a month later.\n\nWhen Kelly joined the team, already in their second years were wide receiver Andre Reed and defensive end Bruce Smith, two cornerstone-type players who had been drafted by general manager Bill Polian; Hull and tackle Will Wolford, a 1986 first-round pick, joined an offensive line that included solid pros Jim Ritcher and Joe Devlin; Pete Metzelaars was an up-and-coming tight end and Greg Bell a productive running back; and joining Smith on defense were nose tackle Fred Smerlas, linebackers Darryl Talley and Eugene Marve, and defensive backs Charley Romes and Steve Freeman. Then, nine games into that season came the coach, Marv Levy, who replaced the woeful Hank Bullough.\n\nThe Bills finished that first year of the Kelly Era a lowly 4-12, but as Hull said, \"We were losing, but he still looked good, so there was always promise with Jim. Then all of a sudden things started getting better, we started getting more people. That stuff is contagious, and it all started with the gunslinger.\"\n\nLinebacker Shane Conlan and cornerback Nate Odomes were drafted in 1987, Steve Tasker -- who signed the same week that Levy was hired -- began to establish himself as a special teams terror, linebacker Cornelius Bennett was obtained in a blockbuster Halloween night trade, and suddenly the Bills were on the rise. They were in contention in the AFC East until December, finishing 7-8 (one game was lost to the NFL strike), and when running back Thurman Thomas was drafted in 1988, he became the final piece in Polian's masterful rebuild.\n\nThe Bills won the first of the six AFC East titles in Kelly's tenure in 1988 and advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost in Cincinnati, 21-10.\n\nIn 1989, Kelly was knocked out of a Week 5 game in Indianapolis when right tackle Howard Ballard missed a block. The next day he publicly chastised the young player, and it created a storm of controversy that never subsided the rest of that year.\n\nThe Bickering Bills battled each other in the press, yet were still good enough to win the AFC East again with a so-so 9-7 record, then were knocked out of the playoffs by Cleveland in a 34-30 shootout which, as it turned out, proved to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nThat day, offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda unveiled a version of a no-huddle offense, and Kelly threw for 404 yards, his all-time high in the NFL. Kelly was masterful at the breakneck pace, calling his own plays as he flung passes all over the place while the Browns breathlessly tried to keep pace. If not for Ronnie Harmon's clear-cut drop of a sure touchdown pass in the waning seconds, the Bills would have won that game. Instead, they headed into 1990 poised to tear up the NFL.\n\nIt didn't happen right away as they mothballed the no-huddle because there was no need to unleash it. They won nine of their first 11 games and were cruising to a third straight division crown. But with Buddy Ryan's defensive monsters from Philadelphia visiting Rich Stadium on the first Sunday in December, Levy gave the go-ahead to use the no-huddle full-time. The Bills scored 24 points in the first quarter on the way to a 30-23 victory, and a revolution was on the way.\n\nThey finished the schedule 13-3, then recorded two remarkable home playoff victories over archrival Miami (44-34) and the Raiders (51-3) as Kelly threw for a combined 639 yards and five touchdowns, and would you believe it, the Buffalo Bills were going to the Super Bowl.\n\nDid you know?\n\nRich Stadium (now Ralph Wilson Stadium) opened in 1973 and did not host a playoff game until Jan. 1, 1989, the day Kelly and the Bills defeated Warren Moon and the Houston Oilers 17-10. Kelly had an 8-1 playoff record as a starting quarterback in Orchard Park, with the lone blemish coming against Jacksonville on Dec. 28, 1996 – the final game of his career.\n\n\"Serial Killers of the Super Bowl.\"\n\nThat was what New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica called the Bills on the eve of their fourth consecutive appearance in the Super Bowl. Harsh, for sure, but there wasn't much to argue when the Bills proceeded to lose Super Bowl XXVIII to Dallas 30-13 at the Georgia Dome on Jan. 30, 1994.\n\nThere's a very good chance that Buffalo's streak of four consecutive AFC conference championships will never be matched, and if it is, it seems almost impossible that the Bills' gut-wrenching streak of four consecutive Super Bowl losses would be duplicated.\n\n\"There are a lot of guys who played this game who never reached the Super Bowl,\" linebacker Darryl Talley said. \"I was fortunate to have four bites of the apple, though I didn't eat the whole thing. It doesn't bother me that bad anymore.\"\n\nHis teammates feel the same way. Of course it's unfortunate that the Bills never won one, but as the years go by, football experts and fans are recognizing just how remarkable that feat was.\n\n\"We're getting so much respect for that now, because it's so hard to do,\" wide receiver Andre Reed said. \"Our team was all about character and what Marv preached with resiliency, and we teach that to our kids and go on in our own lives and we inspire people because of that stuff that happened. If we'd have won four, it would be the same, the only difference would be that we won four. But that didn't happen.\"\n\nThe Bills' best chance, of course, came in the first one, No. XXV in Tampa, when Scott Norwood's last-second 47-yard field goal sailed wide right, enabling the Giants to escape with a 20-19 victory.\n\n\"It was something that every one us had dreamed about ever since we were little kids,\" Kelly said, recalling that initial visit to the NFL's grandest stage. \"And there we were. Me and (Tasker) always walked out (of the locker room and down the tunnel) together, and we're walking down there and it was like dominoes. We walked out and by the time we got down to the end of the tunnel we had every single person looking at us. Then we get into the stadium and words can't describe the feeling you get knowing that you worked all your life to get that opportunity to play in the Super Bowl and here we were. And then Whitney Houston sang the national anthem and I'll tell you, if I wasn't playing I probably would have cried. It was pretty emotional. At that time I would have rather been a linebacker than a quarterback because I was so pumped up. I almost felt like I could rip someone's head off.\"\n\nUnfazed by that heartbreaking defeat, the Bills were even better in 1991. This was Kelly's greatest season, as he worked almost exclusively in the no-huddle and set the franchise record for passing yards with 3,844 and threw 25 touchdowns in leading the Bills to a second straight 13-3 record and a fourth straight AFC East title.\n\nThat year, the Bills set team records for points (458), touchdowns (58), first downs (359) and total yards (6,252) that remain unbroken, but after sailing past Kansas City (37-14) and Denver (10-7) in the playoffs, they met up with Washington in Super Bowl XXVI and the Redskins wiped the Bills off the Metrodome field, 37-24 -- a game that wasn't even as close as the 13-point final margin.\n\nIt was a miserable day for Kelly as he threw four interceptions. \"You only get so many chances,\" he said afterward. \"I'll be 32 next month. Time's running out on me. From the neck down, the whole second half is kind of fuzzy to me. I can remember part of the game, but not all of it. The part I can remember, I didn't like. This is hard to take because we have such a good team. We've come a long way. You hate to say, 'There's always next year.' You get tired of saying that.\"\n\nSadly, they would say it at the end of 1992 as well. This time, the Bills had to work a little harder to qualify for a third straight Super Bowl, a feat previously accomplished only by the 1972-74 Miami Dolphins. They failed to win the AFC East for the first time since 1987, losing out to the Dolphins. And in the AFC wild-card game at home against Houston, with Kelly on the sidelines recovering from a knee injury, the Bills fell behind 35-3 early in the fourth quarter.\n\nYou know what happened next. The Bills pulled off the greatest comeback in NFL history and won that game behind backup Frank Reich, 41-38 in overtime, then went into Pittsburgh, where the defense played superbly in a 24-3 pounding of the Steelers. Kelly was able to return in time for the AFC Championship Game at Miami, and while he wasn't great, he was good enough to get Steve Christie in position for five field goals and the Bills rolled, 29-10.\n\nRiding such a wave of momentum, the Bills thought they had a great chance against the Cowboys at the Rose Bowl in Super Bowl XXVII. Maybe they would have had they not turned the ball over a record nine times in an embarrassing 52-17 debacle. Kelly was knocked out of the game in the second quarter with the Bills trailing only 14-7, and it all fell apart from there.\n\n\"Why me, why me?\" Kelly asked afterward. \"I said early in the week it would come down to turnovers. Unfortunately, I was right. We couldn't beat a college team with that many turnovers. This loss hurts the most because we had worked so hard and overcome so much to get here. Somebody's got to win and somebody's got to lose, I just wish we could see what it feels like to win.\"\n\nThere would be one more chance. Another AFC East title in 1993 with a 12-4 record, a come-from-behind divisional playoff victory over the Raiders, and a 30-13 whacking of Joe Montana and the Chiefs in the AFC championship game sent the Bills to the Georgia Dome for a rematch with the Cowboys. But, after taking a 13-6 halftime lead, Thurman Thomas lost a fumble early in the third quarter that was returned for a touchdown, and the Cowboys soared to a 30-13 victory, completing Buffalo's golden sombrero of Super Bowl losses.\n\n\"We have a lot to be proud of, but we have to figure out what it's going to take to win one,\" Kelly said. \"We're going to keep going until we get it right. What else can you say?\"\n\nThere was nothing more to say, and there was never a chance to finally get it right.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Bills' 20-19 loss to the Giants in Super Bowl XXV is the only Super Bowl to be decided by a single point. Six other Super Bowls, including all three of New England's victories, have been decided by three points.\n\nThe Bills' streak of making the playoffs six years in a row ended in 1994, with Kelly unable to finish the season due to a knee injury, but they bounced back in 1995 to win the sixth and final division crown of Kelly's tenure.\n\nWith a 10-6 record, the Bills had to play in the AFC wild-card round, and during a 37-22 thrashing of Miami in Don Shula's final game, the Bills set a new AFC playoff record with 341 rushing yards. This game, as it turned out, has proven to be the last playoff victory for Buffalo.\n\nThe following week, Kelly returned home to western Pennsylvania for a matchup with the Steelers, and the Bills were no match for the eventual AFC champions, losing 40-21 in a game that Bruce Smith missed due to the flu, and Kelly threw for just 135 yards and three interceptions.\n\nWhen the 1996 season began, everyone knew Kelly was in the final year of his most-recently signed contract, and his future was uncertain. He had clearly begun to decline, as had the team, but there was enough left in the tank to squeeze out another playoff qualification, this time as a 10-6 wild-card team as Drew Bledsoe and the Patriots won the division.\n\nKelly threw for 2,810 yards, the second-lowest total of his career, and the offense had sputtered throughout the year, yet there wasn't a whole lot of concern heading into the game against Jacksonville, a second-year expansion team that shocked the football world by making the playoffs. The Bills had never lost a postseason game at Rich Stadium, but with the game tied 27-27, Kelly was knocked out of the game with a concussion, and he lost a fumble on the play. The Jaguars pounced on that turnover and turned it into a game-winning field goal by Mike Hollis with 3:07 left to play.\n\nAfter all he had accomplished in Buffalo, it couldn't have been a worse way for Kelly's career to have ended, losing a playoff game at home to a heavy underdog, and leaving the field on a cart, unable to finish the game.\n\nA little more than a month later, Kelly made it official: He was done, announcing his retirement in a lavish press conference held inside the team's practice facility, televised live on local TV as well as ESPN.\n\nSeveral years later, he reflected on what it meant to be the quarterback of the Bills.\n\n\"I always knew, and I was always brought up believing, that you can't do things alone,\" Kelly said. \"I know I was a key ingredient because of the position I played, and I knew that in order for the Bills to go anywhere they had to have a top quarterback. But I also take great pride in knowing that I was one of our leaders on the team. Early on I made mistakes, just like most people do. There were things I wish I could take back that I can't. I've always been taught that it's what you do about the negatives, never dwell on them, learn from them, and move on. I was able to get people to not so much follow me, but join me, and I had enough people to join me.\"\n\nDid you know?\n\nKelly owns the Bills career records for passing completions (2,874), attempts (4,780), yards (35,467), touchdowns (237), average yard per attempt (7.42) and 300-yard games (26).\n\nAt the height of his football celebrity Jim Kelly was one of the most eligible bachelors in Buffalo and could have had almost any woman he wanted. Jill Waggoner, just 21 years old in the summer of 1991, was the one he wanted.\n\nIn her book Without A Word, Jill wrote about the circumstances that led to her and Kelly meeting, falling in love, having a child, and marrying.\n\nKelly lived in a huge house in the affluent Hillsboro neighborhood of Orchard Park, a short ride away from Rich Stadium, and it became party central on Sunday nights following Bills home games. The team would gather there along with anyone else who had been able to wrangle an invitation, and if you didn't have one, you weren't getting past the doorman, Kelly's good buddy and bodyguard Big Ed. The parties became legendary as famous athletes and beautiful women talked, drank, danced and, well, you get the picture.\n\nOne night Jill and a girlfriend had been invited by friends of Jim's, and she couldn't believe the scene when she walked through the doors and saw her future husband -- \"a notorious partier,\" as she described him in her book -- in action. Eventually, someone introduced Kelly to the two young girls, and Jill described him as being \"very gracious and polite\" and recalled his complimenting her on her \"beautiful green eyes.\" Jill figured that would be the extent of her meet and greet with the famous host, but she said he flirted with her the rest of the night and, at the end, asked for her phone number.\n\nShe said no, but about a week later, the industrious Kelly put one of his people on it and tracked her down at her place of work, asked her out on a date, and she agreed.\n\nFrom that moment on, they were a couple, and a lengthy courting began. After a year and a half Jill moved to south Florida to pursue a career in television marketing and production, but being in a long-distance relationship wasn't working for either of them, and she made the decision to move back to western New York and into Kelly's home in May of 1994.\n\nWithin a few months Jill was pregnant with their first child, Erin Marie, and she feared that Kelly would be upset by the news. Instead, he was thrilled, and a few months before Erin was born, Kelly asked Jill to marry him while the two dined in a private room at Ilio DiPaolo's restaurant in Blasdell. The three-carat diamond ring was presented to Jill on the top of a heart-shaped cake made personally by Dennis DiPaolo that read \"Will You Marry Me?\"\n\nErin was born in early 1995, and her parents were married on May 18, 1996, a wedding that was the social event of the year in Buffalo. More than 600 guests were present inside St. Christopher's in suburban Buffalo, hundreds of others were outside the church trying to catch a glimpse, and then the reception was held at the New York State Armory in the heart of the city where guests were required to present a numbered invitation to gain entrance.\n\nJill wrote in her book that the marriage did not get off to a great start because in cleaning out the house in the summer months after the wedding, she stumbled across upsetting remnants of Jim's bachelor life. Also, Jim seemed uninterested in his new life as a husband and father and spent most of the time before the 1996 season -- his first as a married man and his last as an NFL quarterback -- on the road making appearances or just getting together with buddies for golf or fishing trips.\n\nShe hoped that news of a second pregnancy -- which the doctors determined had occurred while the Kellys were honeymooning in Italy -- might reel Jim back in, but she had her doubts.\n\nHunter James Kelly was born on Jim's 37th birthday, Feb. 14, 1997. And before he was four months old, the Kellys learned the terrible news that he was suffering from Krabbe Leukodystrophy, an inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal enzyme disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems that typically kills its victims in the first 13 months.\n\nNothing in Jim and Jill's life would ever be the same again after the diagnosis. It was a devastating day, and for the next eight-plus years, as Hunter demanded constant medical assistance from an army of caregivers, the Kellys' marriage faded to the background, and Jill wrote that she often doubted whether Jim truly loved her, and questioned her own love and commitment to him.\n\nWhat the Kellys endured in these years tugs at the heartstrings, and while there were certainly some happy times -- topped by the healthy birth of their third child, Camryn, in June 1999 -- there were also tremendously difficult and sad times as they felt powerless to help Hunter while always living in fear that he could die at any moment.\n\nJill turned to Jesus Christ in 1998, and by becoming a devout Christian, she found peace and strength and hope that carried her through the toughest times. After initially resisting, Jim saw the light and he, too, dedicated his life to Christ after confessing to Jill that throughout their marriage he had been unfaithful to her almost from the beginning. When Jim turned to Christianity, it was probably a shock to most of those who knew him as the swashbuckling quarterback with the larger-than-life personality and celebrity lifestyle, but he admits now that the moment he decided to do it, \"I felt forgiven, I felt free.\"\n\nThree years after Hunter passed away in 2005, Jim and Jill renewed their wedding vows, and it was as if he had pushed the reset button on his life. It is their faith that guides them today as Jim battles the toughest opponent he's ever faced: Cancer.\n\nDid you know?\n\nJill Kelly grew up in Attica, Wyoming County, and is a 1987 graduate of Notre Dame High School in Batavia.\n\nJim Kelly and toughness go together about as well as peanut butter and jelly, his sandwich of choice as a youngster growing up in tiny East Brady, Pa. The majestic spirals that he threw, so powerful that they seemed to cut through the bitingly cold Orchard Park air with a smile, will never be forgotten. Nor will the sight of Kelly, after every touchdown pass he tossed at Rich Stadium, pointing up to his luxury box where his family sat every Sunday and giving them a heartfelt salute.\n\nHe was brash. He had swagger. He had an absolute confidence in himself, mistaken at first as arrogance when he first blew into Buffalo in the summer of 1986 and was charged with rejuvenating not only a sad-sack football franchise but a sagging city. But more than anything, it was Kelly's toughness that set him apart from almost every quarterback who ever played the game.\n\nHis Bills coach, Marv Levy, has said he was \"the toughest player I ever coached.\"\n\nOh, Kelly was tough, there's no denying it. But he had nothing on his son, Hunter, a little boy who raised the toughness meter to astronomical standards, and Kelly made sure everyone knew that on the afternoon in 2002 that he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\"It has been written throughout my career that toughness is my trademark,\" Kelly said of Hunter, then 5 1/2 years old. \"Well, the toughest person I've ever met in my life is my hero, my soldier, my son, Hunter.''\n\nHunter was born on Valentine's Day 1997, a seemingly healthy 7-pound, 14-ounce boy. He was supposed to have died somewhere around Valentine's Day 1998. Instead, serving as the ultimate definition of what it means to be Kelly Tough, Hunter graced the world with his presence until August of 2005. You want to talk about tough? Hunter endured an unfathomable existence, yet he fought like a Kelly, and when the miracle that was his life finally ended, he had lived longer than any child born with the disease that afflicts one out of every 100,000 live births.\n\nThe news of Hunter's plight not only rocked the Kellys, it affected the entire community. Jim was a hero, Buffalo's connection to the big time, the Hall of Famer, Mr. Buffalo Bill. If he was hurting, so, too, were western New Yorkers, and millions of tears were shed during the epoch that was Hunter's life. The Kellys were always very public regarding Hunter in the hope that, as Jill said, \"putting a face on this horrible disease\" would help increase efforts to find a cure. They appeared on Oprah and the Today show, People magazine did a huge spread, and so did several other publications, and their fundraising efforts through the Hunter's Hope foundation that they established in 1997 have been the stuff of legend.\n\nIt was all rather amazing how this little boy, this soldier, his father's hero, had such an impact and left such a lasting impression on everyone who came in contact with him, and even those who never knew him, because his story was so powerful, so heart-wrenching.\n\nHunter never spoke, he never smiled, he never walked, he never threw the football around in the backyard with his famous father who had long dreamt of doing that if he was so fortunate to have a son. But Hunter lived, and he inspired, and he meant more to his father than anything Jim -- the toughest football player of his generation and many others -- ever accomplished on the gridiron.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Hunter's Hope Foundation was founded by Jim and Jill Kelly in 1997, shortly after their son, Hunter, was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy. For more information on Hunter's Hope, go to huntershope.org.\n\nJim Kelly's football achievements, as magnificent as they were, also pale in comparison to the tireless work he and his wife Jill have done with their foundation, Hunter's Hope, which they established in 1997 as a way to raise money for research to find a cure for the horrible disease which afflicted, and later took the life of, their son.\n\nBut long before Hunter was born and Hunter's Hope became a lifelong commitment, Kelly was fully aware of the responsibilities he would shoulder as the team's star quarterback. When he landed in Buffalo in August of 1986, he knew his main priority was to help turn the sagging Bills franchise into a winner, and with that machine gun of an arm -- yes, remember the Machine Gun Kelly poster? -- he was well-equipped to do that. But being a professional athlete, especially one at the top end of the pay scale, is about so much more than production on the field. When you become the face of a franchise, as Kelly did, you have an inherent obligation to become a pillar of the community you represent, and not only give back what you can to the people who help to pay your salary, but to help those less fortunate.\n\nSome athletes never get this. Kelly got it from day one. Almost as soon as that limo whisked him from the airport to his introductory press conference where he signed his five-year, $8 million contract, he established his Kelly For Kids Foundation, defining the mission statement as follows: To serve disadvantaged and disabled youth in western New York through a variety of grants raised through the year. Now coming up on three decades of existence, Kelly For Kids has distributed more than $5 million to local charities, though the main beneficiary now is Hunter's Hope.\n\nHunter's life could not be saved, but the Kelly's fervent wish is that Hunter's Hope can help save the lives of other children by advocating mandatory universal newborn screening in every state, and to fund research efforts that will identify new treatments, therapies, and ultimately a cure for Krabbe disease and other leukodystrophies. The foundation also provides monetary gifts for families to partially cover travel expenses related to treatment, and it helps cover the cost of Hunter's Homes, three homes near Duke Medical Center in Durham, N.C., where families stay free of charge while going through the Cord Blood Transplant process.\n\nAll of this takes money, and the Jim Kelly Celebrity Golf Classic, which was held for the 28th consecutive year in early June 2014, is the primary fundraiser for Kelly For Kids. Originally played at Brierwood Country Club outside Buffalo, it has been held since 2006 at Terry Hills Golf Course in Batavia.\n\nThe event begins with the Sunday night VIP Gala dinner at the Adams Mark Hotel in downtown Buffalo, typically attended by about a thousand people, one of the biggest charity events of the year in western New York.\n\nOn Monday, everyone heads to the golf course for a long day of golf, food, raffles and camaraderie. Each foursome -- of which there were nearly 50 this year -- is joined by a celebrity from sports or entertainment, and the list through the years is impressive. Among the tournament alumni are former Bills' greats Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed, Joe DeLamielleure, Fred Smerlas and Steve Tasker; former NFL stars Dan Marino, Bernie Kosar, Archie Manning, Anthony Munoz and Doug Flutie; actors Daniel Baldwin, Chris McDonald and Jamie Farr; and ESPN's Chris Berman.\n\nAnother key component under the vast umbrella of Kelly For Kids is the Jim Kelly Football Camp, which not only raises money but also provides young aspiring football players the chance to learn from a man who was a hero to many of their fathers, maybe even a few grandfathers.\n\nThe football camp was first held in 1988 with 325 campers on hand listening intently to the then young quarterback of the up-and-coming Bills teach them lessons about football, family, health and nutrition, drug awareness, sportsmanship and teamwork. Each year the camp has grown and today, approximately 500 campers per year take part, and Kelly has never missed one -- even in July 2014, when he was barely three weeks removed from his last chemotherapy and radiation treatments. In the last few years, the camp has been held in the Buffalo area, but Kelly has conducted a special one-day camp at St. John Fisher College, home of the Bills' annual training camp since 2000.\n\nKelly has also benefited from his fame on the field as a businessman off the field. During his playing days he opened a nightclub in downtown Buffalo called Network, along with an adjoining sports bar called the Sports City Bar & Grill, that were popular hangouts in the early- to mid-1990s. However, they didn't last long, and when they were going out of business, the companies that operated the restaurants filed for bankruptcy, leaving creditors unpaid, and Kelly was vilified for this. Outside of the long lines one had to stand in to get into the clubs when they were first opened, the most memorable thing that happened there was a 1994 brawl that saw six members of the Hartford Whalers NHL team -- Chris Pronger, Pat Verbeek, Geoff Sanderson, Marc Potvin, Mark Janssen and Todd Harkins, and assistant coach Kevin McCarthy -- get arrested.\n\nAt one time he was a pitchman for Wegmans -- remember the WPOP commercials? -- and he also did ads for Toys R Us, The United Way, and several other companies. More recently, he founded Jim Kelly Inc., a company which produces the MyFanClip line of all-purpose clips bearing team logos. The company has procured licensing agreements with the NFL, MLB, NHL, NASCAR, and several NCAA institutions, with proceeds earmarked to benefit the Hunter's Hope Foundation.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAt one point in 2001, Kelly had a relationship with supermarkets Tops and Wegmans at the same time. He had a personal relationship with Tops and, because Wegmans was a training camp and team sponsor of the Bills, was involved with a ticket sales campaign through Wegmans.\n\nWhere else would you rather be than right here, right now? That was one of Marv Levy's favorite axioms, and on the afternoon of Aug. 3, 2002, there was no place Levy would have rather been than at Fawcett Stadium in Canton, Ohio to present the greatest quarterback in Bills history for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThere had been many great days in the town that gave birth to the NFL, but the 2002 enshrinement ceremony certainly ranks as one of the greatest. When it was announced in late January that Kelly had been voted into the Hall in his first year on the ballot, the folks at Kelly Enterprises informed Canton officials that, to borrow a phrase from a famous movie about a shark, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\"\n\nSince the induction of the first class in 1963, the ceremony was held on the steps leading to the front door of the Hall, and the spectators congregated in the area out front. But with Kelly in the class, Canton was going to be inundated with Bills fans, and there was no way they were all going to fit.\n\nThus, the ceremony was moved next door to Fawcett Stadium where the annual Hall of Fame game was played, and it was a good thing because there were tens of thousands of blue-shirted Bills fans there to fete their favorite son. It has remained there ever since.\n\n\"Is there anyone here from Buffalo today?\" Levy said as he stepped to the podium, producing a titanic roar. \"Is there anyone back in Buffalo today?\"\n\nLevy, who had been enshrined just a year earlier, then delivered an ever-eloquent speech.\n\n\"You know, in order to win in the NFL you've got to have ability and sometimes you gotta have some luck, too,\" Levy said. \"Well, Jim Kelly had ability and much more. I was the one who had the luck because from the very first day I became coach of the Buffalo Bills I was keenly aware of what a special player, and what a special person Jim Kelly was. How lucky can a guy get?\"\n\nLevy went on to add, \"If you ask this specific coach who he wants to line up at quarterback for his team, I'd answer by pointing, right there, No. 12, Jim Kelly. Never mind his eye-popping statistics, he never cared about them anyway. Jim cared about winning, and he was a winner. He cared about his team and about his teammates. He cared about his wonderful family, and about our loyal and enthusiastic Buffalo Bills fans. He cared about his community, and he showed it. Never mind about his arm, it was great, but what was really noteworthy about Jim was his heart. Jim Kelly's heart was as stout as a nose tackle's butt.\"\n\nBy the time Kelly stepped up, the crowd was primed, and Kelly delivered a speech commensurate with the thrilling touchdown drives he once directed for the Bills. First, it took a minute for the crowd to stop cheering, and Kelly quipped, \"C'mon now, I only have seven minutes to give my speech!\"\n\nHe then knocked it out of the park with the way he delivered the speech, and the points that he made throughout. Early, he began with, \"Boy, my life has been a series of crossing patterns involving family and football and I can't remember a time when football hasn't been a part of my life. But, I can tell you I would have never made it this far without the constant love, support and dedication of my family, my friends and you, the Buffalo Bill fans, the greatest in the NFL.\"\n\nHe systematically thanked his parents, his five brothers, and some of his coaches along the way, before getting to the Buffalo portion of his life.\n\n\"And then, I made the greatest decision of my life; I became a Buffalo Bill,\" he said. \"I can't think of a better owner to play for than Ralph Wilson, and his place in this Hall is waiting (which turned out to be prophetic). He guaranteed me that he would provide the weapons for the Bills to be a Super Bowl team, and boy did he ever.\"\n\nKelly then went through the list, mentioning Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, Andre Reed, James Lofton, Steve Tasker, Darryl Talley, Jim Ritcher, Will Wolford, Pete Metzelaars, Don Beebe, Kenny Davis, Frank Reich, Kent Hull, Alex Van Pelt and Ruben Brown.\n\nHe thanked Levy, several assistant coaches, general managers Bill Polian and John Butler, many members of the Bills' administrative staff, and he even gave a shout out to long-time Buffalo News columnist Larry Felser, who made the case for Kelly -- not that one really needed to be made -- for his induction in the Hall of Fame voting room.\n\nFinally, his family, who he addressed as they sat in the warm sunshine in the front row, his wife, Jill, their daughters Erin and Camryn, and their son Hunter. At this point, Hunter was five, and Jim and Jill knew that he understood where he was, and what was happening. They also knew they had been blessed that Hunter had beaten the odds and lived this long, four years longer than the doctors originally thought he would.\n\n\"Since the day I was selected (in January 2002), I prayed to God that my son would be here with me today,\" Kelly said. \"God has granted me that blessing. It has been written throughout my career that toughness is my trademark. Well, the toughest person I've ever met in my life is my hero, my soldier, my son, Hunter. I love you, buddy. Thank you, Canton, thank you Buffalo and God bless.\"\n\nThere were cheers, yes. And there were tears, Many of them. What a special day it was, indeed.\n\nDid you know?\n\nJim Kelly is one of 10 members of the Buffalo Bills family to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The others are: Joe DeLamielleure; Marv Levy; James Lofton; Andre Reed; Billy Shaw; O.J. Simpson; Bruce Smith; Thurman Thomas and Ralph Wilson Jr.\n\nThe headaches were becoming unbearable, and for a man who was so used to dealing with pain and shrugging it off like it was nothing, it was newsworthy that Jim Kelly felt the need to have tests done to discover the cause of the terrible discomfort he was dealing with in the spring of 2014.\n\nNever mind 11 years of violence in the NFL. This is a guy who had survived a single-prop plane crash into the Bering Sea while on a hunting trip in Alaska. Headaches were knocking him to his knees?\n\nKelly has endured countless surgeries due to all the football injuries he suffered -- part of the roll call including two plates and 10 screws in his back, another plate and six screws in his neck. His knees, ankles and shoulders all have surgical scars, as does his abdomen, where he had a double hernia. He's had broken fingers, several concussions and pulled muscles.\n\nThat was all before things really got tough for him, when he was diagnosed with oral cancer in May of 2013. He underwent a procedure where part of his upper jaw and several teeth were removed, which doctors believed eradicated the cancer, and he was fitted with a prosthetic jaw complete with six false teeth. In the aftermath, he underwent six root canals on the teeth that are still his originals, as doctors tried to piece the inside of his mouth back together.\n\nKelly took on the big 'C' exactly as you would expect - with bravery, confidence, toughness, and faith. \"We are all faced with challenges and unfortunately I've gone through more than the average person, but oh well,\" Kelly said. \"Ups and downs, that's my life. But it's what you do about it that matters. No matter what I did in football, my family life, you never give up. ... You move on and make tomorrow a little better than today.\"\n\nHe said fighting cancer was just \"another river to cross\", a nod to the Super Bowl years when Bill Polian used to say that about the Bills as they marched through obstacles season after AFC championship season. And just like he did so often on the field, it seemed Kelly was winning. Within three weeks of his surgery, doctors told Kelly he was cancer free, and a collective sigh could be heard blowing through western New York. Their guy was going to be OK.\n\nBut on the road to apparent recovery, those rivers were getting deeper to negotiate. The headaches throughout the late fall and winter into 2014 - worse than a migraine, he said - were an indication to him that all was not well, and finally, he couldn't take it anymore. He went through a battery of tests, and the news was not good. The cancer was back in the form of microscopic tumors inside his face, having taken root in the maxillary sinus cavity and adjacent tissues, and now spreading dangerously up his infraorbital nerve, close to the carotid artery.\n\nAt first, doctors thought they could surgically remove the tumors, but they opted instead to treat the cancer with radiation and chemotherapy. He spent six weeks at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, and then concluded his treatment at the Cancer Care of Western New York in Cheektowaga. When the process ended in early June, he had lost 51 pounds, and into August he still could not eat, his nourishment coming via a feeding tube in his stomach.\n\nYet Kelly wasn't going to let cancer prevent him from doing the things he covets. He showed up at the end of the Bills' mini-camp and gave the team a pep talk before they broke for pre-training camp vacation. He couldn't make it to his golf tournament, but he was there for his youth football camp, teaching the kids the basics of football, and thanking everyone for their remarkable support. He went to Canton to celebrate Andre Reed's Hall of Fame induction, and he was on the sidelines when the Bills played their first preseason game at renovated Ralph Wilson Stadium, days after learning that the chemo and radiation treatments had worked, and there was no sign of the cancerous tumors.\n\nWhen you have cancer, there isn't a day that goes by when you don't think about it. Cancer came back once to Kelly, and who knows what the future holds because this disease is so unpredictable. But for now, Kelly's bustling life continues on, and while cancer has proved to be his toughest opponent, perhaps cancer is learning that Kelly Tough is one of its toughest opponents, too.\n\nDid you know?\n\nJill Kelly has used social media extensively during her husband's battle with cancer, using Instagram, Twitter (with popular hashtags #PrayersforJK and #KellyTough) and Facebook to share updates, pictures and messages of faith.\n\nFeb. 14, 1960: James Edward Kelly was born in East Brady, Pa., one of his six Kelly sons born to Joe and Alice Kelly.\n\nSept. 1974 through March 1978: Kelly starred for East Brady High School, throwing for 3,915 yards and 44 touchdowns and leading the Bulldogs to a 26-2-1 record during his three years as the starting varsity quarterback. He also averaged 23 points and 20 rebounds in basketball as a senior.\n\nAugust 1978: Heads to the University of Miami after accepting a scholarship from Hurricanes coach Lou Saban, the former coach of the Bills. He red-shirted that first year and never played for Saban, who stepped down after the season to take the head coaching job at Army.\n\nOct. 27, 1979: With the new Carrier Dome under construction in Syracuse, the Orangemen played one of their \"home\" games at Rich Stadium in Orchard Park and defeated the University of Miami, 25-15, in front of only about 8,000 fans. Kelly entered the game in the third quarter and threw for one TD and passed for a two-point conversion. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 130 yards in the first extended action of his collegiate career.\n\nNov. 3, 1979: In the first start of his college career, Kelly led the Hurricanes to a 26-10 victory over Penn State at Beaver Stadium in State College, Pa. It was a sweet day for Kelly because Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno had recruited Kelly heavily, but as a linebacker, thinking Kelly couldn't play quarterback at the Division I level. Kelly threw for 280 yards and 3 TDs.\n\nOct. 31, 1981: Kelly did it again to Paterno. The No. 1-ranked Nittany Lions traveled to the Orange Bowl and Kelly led the Hurricanes to a 17-14 upset victory, throwing an 80-yard TD pass in the process.\n\nSept. 18, 1982: Kelly's college career came to an end when he suffered a serious shoulder injury in a game at Virginia Tech.\n\nApril 26, 1983: With the second of their first-round draft picks, the Bills selected Kelly No. 14 overall, two picks after they'd chosen Notre Dame tight end Tony Hunter. Watching the draft on ESPN with his parents at the Akron, Ohio, home of attorney Ken Weinberger, Kelly wasn't too thrilled with being picked by the Bills.\n\nJune 9, 1983: Ending a couple months of intrigue, Kelly decided to spurn the Bills and signed with the Houston Gamblers of the USFL. Owner Jerry Argovitz signed Kelly to a four-year contract that was reportedly worth between $4 and $5 million, making him the league's second-highest player behind Herschel Walker. \"There are risks in doing what I'm doing, but I made up my mind,\" Kelly said. \"Everybody has to take a risk once in a while. I'm happy I did it and I won't regret it. I always wanted to play in the NFL, but right now, the USFL is the same as the NFL. It's a business now.\"\n\nJuly 2, 1984: Was named the USFL's player of the year after throwing for 5,219 yards and a single-season pro football record 44 touchdowns for the Gamblers. Upon receiving the award, Kelly said: \"I cried when Buffalo drafted me (in the 1983 draft). Well, maybe I didn't cry, but it wasn't one of the greatest things that happened in my life. You can't be a great quarterback in snow and 30 mph winds.\" Bills management wasn't pleased by his statements. \"I think it's unfortunate that a moment of considerable personal triumph for him turned into a little bit of an unfortunate statement,\" said Bills general manager Terry Bledsoe.\n\nFeb. 1, 1985: Interviewed in Houston, Kelly reiterated his disdain for playing in Buffalo. \"If Buffalo were my last option, I would go there, but every quarterback wants to play in warm weather,\" he said. \"Of all the places that should have a domed stadium, it's Buffalo. If Buffalo plans on getting anybody, if you ever want a chance of having a winning team, tell Ralph Wilson he's going to have to spend some money.\"\n\nMay 27, 1985: Suffered a season-ending knee injury playing for the Houston Gamblers in the USFL. That ended any speculation that he could join the Bills for the 1985 season.\n\nJuly 21, 1986: In a Sports Illustrated story, Kelly said that with the merger of the Gamblers and New Jersey Generals, thus pairing him with Herschel Walker, the new Generals' offense would be unstoppable. \"With my receivers and Herschel, we could score 35 points on the Chicago Bears. No question,\" Kelly said.\n\nAug. 18, 1986: With the collapse of the USFL, Kelly signed a five-year, $8 million contract with the Bills after intense negotiations in Houston, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. Kelly flew to Buffalo and received an incredible hero's welcome from the city. Fans lined the route from the airport to downtown waving at his limo and holding signs welcoming him. During a huge press conference at the Buffalo Hilton — which was televised live locally — Kelly received a call from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Kelly said: \"Who knows? Maybe I'll be able to take this team to the Super Bowl and get a call from the President next.\" He then told the gathering: \"I can't promise you a Super Bowl, because you're only as good as the people they put around you. If I can get some help, I definitely think we can take this team to a championship.\"\n\nSept. 7, 1986: Before a sellout crowd of 79,951 at Rich Stadium, the Kelly Era began and while the Bills lost to the Jets, 28-24, Kelly showed that the Bills would be much-improved.

I've had calls inquiring about being a quarterback coach, and one thing I was sure I did not want to do was be a coach.\"\n\nMay 27, 1997: Kelly's son, Hunter, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

He has also experienced more than his share of heartache.\n\nAs quarterback of the Buffalo Bills, he sparked a resurgence in a struggling NFL franchise that saw the football team experience the euphoria of an unprecedented four consecutive AFC championships and the disappointment of four straight Super Bowl losses.\n\nThe resiliency Kelly and his teammates showed endeared them to football fans across the region — and the country — and the relationship goes beyond football. Bills fans cheered Kelly when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and have shed tears for him and his wife Jill as they endured the unimaginable pain of losing their son Hunter at age 8 to a rare disease.\n\nKelly and his family (wife Jill and daughters Erin and Camryn) stayed in the Buffalo area and continue to give back through their charity work with the Hunter's Hope and Kelly for Kids foundations and his annual football camp.\n\nThe connection between the former quarterback and the western New York community has never been stronger than the past several months after Kelly learned that the cancer he had been diagnosed with in 2013 had returned.\n\nThe treatment was intense. Kelly, with the unwavering support of his family and friends, took it on the same way he did any opponent — head on. They stood by their faith and the world watched and prayed with them.\n\nEarlier this month, biopsy results confirmed what many had hoped for — Kelly was cancer-free again.\n\nIn celebration of the season's home opener and the man behind the franchise, we present Kelly Tough, a print and digital project that celebrates Kelly's spirit.\n\nGo to DemocratandChronicle.com/jimkelly to see more stories, photos and sports pages from the Democrat and Chronicle archives.

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/history/2015/05/15/125-republic-anniversary-climate-fry-bread-reasons-love-arizona/27240867/", "title": "Arizona's birthday: Arizona became a state on Valentine's Day ...", "text": "Scott Craven, Kerry Lengel, Weldon B. Johnson, Karen Fernau and Connie Cone Sexton\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThis list was originally published May 18, 2015, to celebrate 125 years of The Arizona Republic. We've brought it back to help mark Arizona's 106th birthday!\n\nThere are endless reasons to love Arizona, from the universal (diverse scenery, great weather) to deeply personal (met your romantic partner here).\n\nRegardless of whether you're a native or a recent transplant, here are our top 25 reasons -- plus 100 more -- to love Arizona.\n\n1. Grand Canyon\n\nThis is the Grand Canyon State, and we have the license plates to prove it. Mention \"Grand Canyon\" in any corner of the Earth and people will likely say, \"Arizona.\" (If they say \"Las Vegas,\" straighten them out.) Any Arizona-based list has to start with one of the greatest natural wonders.\n\n2. Native American culture\n\nThe state is blessed with museums, villages and natural wonders that reflect the lives and cultures of people who have lived here for centuries. It's a shame \"casinos\" come readily to mind.\n\n3. Sedona\n\nWith red-rock formations rarely found outside Mars, Sedona would be voted \"Best Landscape\" in most states, but not in one featuring the Grand Canyon. Still, Sedona is a beautiful runner-up.\n\n4. Xeriscaping\n\nIt's just another word for trees and shrubs that require comparatively little care. Combine gravel with drought-tolerant plants and you've just freed up a few weekend hours to watch TV instead of mowing and pruning. Unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\n5. Sunrise, sunset\n\nThe hues to be seen when the sun says hello and goodbye are almost always Instagram-worthy. Sure, some of the most incredible -rises and -sets are the result of pollutants, but if you are going to breathe air you can see, it might as well look like this.\n\n6. Decent amount of water for a desert\n\nWhat with all the lakes, pools and water parks in and around the Valley, the ability to escape the heat is never far away. And based on the number of state residents who descend on San Diego each summer, Arizona could probably annex Mission and Pacific beaches.\n\n7. Unpretentiousness\n\nWith a lack of scientific research to prove otherwise, we say Arizona is one of the 10 most easygoing, modest states (excluding time spent in trendy Scottsdale clubs). Shorts, T-shirts and a friendly vibe dominate among people who rarely take themselves too seriously (unless they're trying to be trendy in a Scottsdale club).\n\n8. Pro sports\n\nThe Phoenix metropolitan area boasts teams in seven professional sports — baseball, basketball, football, hockey, women's basketball, arena football and soccer. You know who doesn't have all these options? San Diego. Los Angeles. San Francisco. Seattle. Ha!\n\n9. Climate diversity\n\nArizona is in a continental sweet spot featuring everything from low desert to alpine meadows. We can enjoy a vast carpet of wildflowers in the spring, and a leafy canopy of golds and oranges in the fall. A different weather pattern is always just a couple of hours away. You know what's a couple of hours away during a Northeast winter? More snow.\n\n10. Birdwatching\n\nThose who visit southeast Arizona will be greeted by a bevy of birds, from sandhill cranes to all kinds of hawks, robins and sparrows. Not only is the area home to native species, but it sits along a migratory path that's often busier than Interstate 10, only with chirping, not road rage.\n\n11. Monument Valley\n\nThe Western landscape does not get more iconic than this. Name one other place that's equally associated with John Wayne and the Roadrunner. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park straddles the Utah state line, but the visitor center, scenic drive and View Hotel are all in Arizona.\n\n12. Predictable politics\n\nClose races in which opposing parties nearly split seats can lead to ineffectiveness (case in point: the federal government). That doesn't happen here, where an \"R\" by a name all but guarantees victory. It's so much easier to pass laws without any opposing views getting in the way.\n\n13. Brief state history\n\nArizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912, and is the youngest of the 48 contiguous states. Imagine being a high school student in, say, Virginia, where the state history encompasses nearly 240 years. That's going to take several semesters. Arizona's history can be wrapped up in one, leaving other semesters for photography and culinary arts.\n\n14. Counties bigger than states\n\nArizona's largest county by area (Coconino) is bigger than nine states. Maricopa County is larger than eight states. Even Arizona's smallest county, Santa Cruz, is larger than Rhode Island.\n\n15. Hispanic roots\n\nArizona's culture and history are richer for the strong ties to Mexico and Central America. From art to food to fashion, Latino traditions have given the state much to honor and celebrate.\n\n16. Frank Lloyd Wright\n\nHomes and structures built or inspired by the famed architect draw attention and tourists. Taliesin West in Scottsdale is a mecca for fans and students, and it stands out in a region where tile and stucco are so omnipresent that you'd expect to find the materials on the state emblem.\n\n17. Old West image\n\nTourists, especially those from overseas, still expect to see gun-toting cowboys on horseback rounding up cattle on a cactus-studded plain. And dude ranches offer just that. As well as air-conditioned cabins and Wi-Fi. Even the Old West has to keep up with the times.\n\n18. Pope scope\n\nThe Vatican loves to look to the heavens as much as anyone, and its Observatory Research Group is hosted by Steward Observatory on the University of Arizona campus. The state's weather lends itself to optimal nighttime viewing.\n\n19. Hoover Dam\n\nRetaining as much water as it does puns, this dam landmark is a monument to man's hubris toward nature. Take the dam tour to hear about the dam history, dam power generation and other dam facts. So many dam puns. (Note: Hoover straddles the Nevada state line, but the cool activities are in Arizona.)\n\n20. Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nThe former U.S. Supreme Court Justice is the embodiment of Arizona's pioneering spirit. Her strength and determination made her a force in the male-dominated legal profession, and her name fittingly graces Arizona State University's law school.\n\n21. John McCain\n\nOne of the nation's leading conservative voices, the Republican U.S. senator is synonymous with Arizona. With frequent appearances on national TV talk shows, his authoritative voice is more familiar than most political leaders'. Sure, there was that little slip with Sarah Palin, but all is forgiven.\n\n22. London Bridge\n\nThe British may laugh at how chain-saw tycoon Robert McCullough paid $2.4 million for a sinking bridge (shipping not included) and reassembled it in a small lakeside town. Now the bridge stars in every \"You won't believe what's in Arizona\" list, bringing more than $2.4 million worth of tourist attention to Lake Havasu City. Now who's laughing?\n\n23. Fry bread\n\nKeep your cronuts and your doughscuits and your cup-pies. The simple deliciousness of fry bread is far more satisfying than any trendy pastry hybrid. Sprinkled with powdered sugar or drizzled with honey, fry bread is the perfect dessert. By the way, there are no such things as cup-pies. Yet.\n\n24. Personalized license plates\n\nHave an opinion or cause you want to support on your bumper? There's a personalized plate for you. Arizona offers 51, from Alternative Fuel to Women Veterans. In the unlikely event that you are a veteran who enjoys watching the Phoenix Suns and has kids in the Boy and Girl Scouts who love pets and the Thunderbird School of Global Management, you have six plates to choose from. Decisions, decisions.\n\n25. No daylight-saving time\n\nWhile America springs forward and falls back, Arizona sticks to its time guns. We like our sunrises and sunsets right where they are on the clock, so you can keep your time ambivalence.\n\nExploring\n\nHere are some reasons to love exploring Arizona.\n\n26. Apache Trail\n\nThis winding road into the Superstition Mountains was built in the early 1900s to move workers and supplies to the Roosevelt Dam construction site. It is still unpaved for many miles. You'll pass desert vistas, three lakes and the Old West-style town of Tortilla Flat. In 1911, President Theodore Roosevelt noted the route's beauty: \"The Apache Trail combines the grandeur of the Alps, the glory of the Rockies, the magnificence of the Grand Canyon and then adds an indefinable something that none of the others have.\"\n\n27. Saguaro National Park\n\nYou expect cactus. What you might not expect are ponderosa pines, aspens and fir trees. Yet they all exist in the 92,000-acre park that straddles Tucson like saddlebags. Elevation ranges from 2,300 feet on the west side to 8,482 feet at the summit of Rincon Peak on the east side. Take your pick of scenic drives and hiking trails. There's plenty for cyclists and equestrians to like, too.\n\n28. Antelope Canyon\n\nWho hasn't admired a photo of this canyon, where ethereal light teases rich reds, bright yellows and warm oranges into mind-bending shapes and patterns? The canyon, about 3 miles southeast of Page, has upper and lower portions, with tours available for both. The upper section is a short, flat walk; ladders get you into and out of the lower portion.\n\n29. Schnebly Hill Road\n\nIn a state packed with scenic drives, how do you narrow the choices? If your wish list includes huge views, red-rock scenery and a twisty dirt road, head for Schnebly Hill Road in Sedona. For maximum thrills, start at the top. Snake your way down, stopping at the overlooks so the driver can get a break from concentrating. If you don't want to beat up your vehicle, several companies in Sedona offer four-wheel-drive tours.\n\n30. Prescott lakes\n\nThe otherworldly rock formations of the Granite Dells make Watson Lake one of the coolest day trips you can take from the Valley. Rent a canoe or a kayak to explore the coves, or just sit on a rock at sunset. Nearby Willow Lake has the same attractions. Goldwater Lake, nestled in the pines just south of Prescott, also has a playground, volleyball court, horseshoe pits and picnic ramadas.\n\n31. Wupatki/Sunset Crater Volcano\n\nIt would be impossible to drive the 36-mile road that links these national monuments north of Flagstaff and not imagine what it must have been like when the volcano blew. The impressive Wupatki Pueblo and other ruins indicate that this was a thriving community. The eerie Bonito Lava Flow shows the power of the eruption of Sunset Crater nearly 1,000 years ago.\n\n32. Mogollon Rim scenic drive\n\nForest Road 300 meanders nearly 45 miles atop the Mogollon Rim between State Route 87 and Woods Canyon Lake, providing vistas that range from nice to gorgeous to stunning. You'll pass meadows, thick stands of conifers and a few aspens. There's a good chance of spotting elk, deer and other wildlife. There are several trailheads along the way. FR 300 isn't paved, but it is in generally good shape. Drive with care and you won't need a high-clearance vehicle.\n\n33. Tombstone\n\nTombstone lures Old West buffs like the Louvre attracts art lovers. It is a pilgrimage that everyone who loves Western movies or history — they are seldom the same — needs to make. You can witness shootouts, ride a stagecoach, dress up like a gunfighter or saloon girl, take a Jeep tour into the Dragoon Mountains and listen to the voice of actor Vincent Price describe the origins of the town at the Historama.\n\n34. Japanese Friendship Garden\n\nJapanese Friendship Garden: It's near downtown Phoenix but you might drive right past this tranquil spot. The garden, named Ro Ho En, is designed to be an authentic Japanese Stroll Garden with tea garden and tea house. Set among 3.5 acres near 3rd Avenue and Roosevelt Street, the site offers more than 1,500 tons of hand-picked rock, stone footbridges, lanterns and dozens of varieties of plants. Take a walk, and you'll go past flowing streams, a 12-foot waterfall, and a Koi pond with more than 300 colorful Koi fish.\n\n35. Pipe Spring National Monument\n\nPerched in the desolation of the Arizona Strip, this monument is an intriguing window into pioneer life. Pipe Spring is a water source used by humans for thousands of years and the site of a cattle ranch established in 1870. Guided tours are offered through a ranch house known as Winsor Castle. A museum contains pioneer and Native American exhibits.\n\nArts and culture\n\nHere are 10 things we love about Arizona's arts and culture. Faves range from the Musical Instrument Museum to the acclaimed Childsplay theater troupe.\n\n36. Musical Instrument Museum\n\nSee more than 6,000 instruments from every corner of the globe, from South African guitars built of oil cans to a giant self-playing \"organ\" made of drums, accordions and saxophones. The Artist Gallery shows pop-culture icons ranging from a Vegas-era Elvis jumpsuit to the piano John Lennon used to compose \"Imagine.\" And you can hear music from around the world on Wi-Fi headphones that tune in to the nearest exhibit.\n\n37. Center for Creative Photography\n\nLocated in Tucson, the center aims to offer the \"finest academic art museums and study centers for the history of photography.'' The center opened in 1975 and began with the archives of five master photographers—Ansel Adams, Wynn Bullock, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, and Frederick Sommer. The collection has grown to include more than 230 archival collections. There are more than five million archival objects at the center, including negatives, work prints, contact sheets, albums, scrapbooks, correspondence, writings, audiovisual materials and memorabilia.\n\n38. ASU Gammage\n\nThis 50-year-old Tempe icon designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is the Valley's home to touring Broadway shows such as \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" \"Wicked\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" — all on the marquee in the coming months. The university-owned venue also hosts cutting-edge dance troupes and concerts by the likes of Philip Glass, who performed his cycle of piano etudes there this year.\n\n39. Ballet Arizona\n\nThe arrival in 2000 of artistic director Ib Andersen, one of the last proteges of the great choreographer George Balanchine, put Ballet Arizona on the national map. In addition to classic story ballets such as \"Swan Lake\" and \"Giselle,\" Andersen has earned acclaim for his annual program of Balanchine's modernist dance.\n\n40. Phoenix Chorale\n\nFormerly known as the Phoenix Bach Choir, the chorus has blossomed into one of the finest in the country under maestro Charles Bruffy. It won a 2009 Grammy Award for best small-ensemble performance for \"Spotless Rose: Hymns to the Virgin Mary,\" and its \"Northern Lights: Choral Works by Ola Gjeilo\" was named best classical vocal album of 2012 by iTunes.\n\n41. Phoenix Art Museum\n\nIt has hosted blockbuster exhibits ranging from Monet and Frida Kahlo to \"The Art of Video Games,\" but the best thing about this museum is the diversity of its offerings. It boasts a fashion-design gallery, an excellent collection of Asian art and a curatorial partnership with the University of Arizona's Center for Creative Photography. It also has a movie theater for screenings such as the National Theatre Live series, beamed over from London.\n\n42. Heard Museum\n\nOne of the Valley's top tourist attractions, the Heard showcases Native American art and culture of the Southwest, from historical relics to contemporary art. It hosts popular events such as the Hoop Dancing Championship, Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair & Market, Katsina Doll Marketplace and Christmas Ornament Marketplace.\n\n43. Childsplay\n\nTempe's professional theater for young audiences has made its name developing new works that have been produced by other companies around the country. Its most recent triumph was the dynamically staged heartbreaker \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,\" based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo. Because this company employs full-time actors, it draws its strength from its sense of ensemble — and company artists such as Jon Gentry, Debra K. Stevens and Katie McFadzen enjoy celebrity status among young theatergoers.\n\n44. 'Arizona Bold'\n\nArizona Opera's recently announced initiative aims to bring contemporary works that speak to Arizona's diverse audience. The series kicked off last year with the world's first mariachi opera, \"Cruzar la Cara de la Luna\" (\"To Cross the Face of the Moon\"), and continues in coming seasons with \"Arizona Lady,\" \"The Last Dream of Frida and Diego\" and the world premiere of \"Riders of the Purple Sage,\" adapted from the Zane Grey novel.\n\n45. Taliesin West\n\nArizona's most famous snowbird was the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who began building Taliesin West, his winter home (and a colony for his acolytes), in 1937. Now a National Historic Landmark, it offers guided tours that show how the desert inspired the design of the estate. A Lego model of Taliesin West was unveiled this year in the pavilion room, built of nearly 200,000 toy bricks worth more than $100,000.\n\nHistorical icons\n\nHere are 10 Arizona historical icons we love.\n\n46. El Tovar\n\nEl Tovar hotel at Grand Canyon opened in 1905. Architect Charles Whittlesey wanted to create a dramatic structure reminiscent of a Swiss chalet, then considered very elegant. The hotel was regarded as one of the finest west of the Mississippi. El Tovar has been updated since then, but the expansive porches are the same, and the log walls in the lobby and dining room feel timeless.\n\n47. Canyon de Chelly National Monument\n\nIn the 1800s, Navajos sought refuge from U.S. soldiers in the distant reaches of Canyon de Chelly in northeast Arizona. Pueblo structures still stand under red cliffs, while modern-day Navajos farm the bottomlands. Visitors can drive along the canyon rim and stop at overlooks or take a short hike to White House Ruin. Tours into the canyon, led by Navajo guides, give a better understanding of its past and present.\n\n48. Jerome\n\nThis town was built on the side of Cleopatra Hill during the copper boom in territorial days. Today, it is a funky, friendly place to explore. Don't miss Jerome State Historic Park — the mansion doesn't just tell the story of mining magnate James Stuart Douglas. It also describes the boomtown his mine created, how everything evaporated so quickly and how the city found new life.\n\n49. Tovrea Castle\n\nItalian immigrant Alessio Carraro built the Phoenix \"wedding cake\" castle from 1928 to 1930 with hopes of turning it into a hotel and housing subdivision. His dreams were short-lived; a feedlot expanded next door. Cattleman E.A. Tovrea purchased the castle in 1932 and moved in with his wife, Della. He died within a year but his widow lived there until 1969. The city bought it in 1993 and recently opened it for tours.\n\n50. Orpheum Theatre\n\nThe nearly 1,400-seat theater in downtown Phoenix started as part of the national Orpheum Circuit chain, which presented vaudeville acts. The theater, designed with Spanish medieval and Baroque touches, opened in 1929. Through the Great Depression and World War II, residents stayed up to date via newsreels shown at the theater. Later, it operated as a movie theater and then a venue for plays and musicals. The building fell into disrepair and demolition was considered until the city bought it in 1984. It underwent a 12-year, $14 million renovation and now hosts a variety of arts productions.\n\n51. Hubbell Trading Post\n\nPart museum, part art gallery and part grocery store, Hubbell Trading Post on the Navajo Reservation is a portal through time. High counters and shelves are stocked with everything from blankets and baskets to clothing and kitchen utensils. Wood floors creak delightfully with every step. The 160-acre national historic site also includes barns, corrals, farm machinery, wagons and animals, including Churro sheep and their prized wool.\n\n52. Whiskey Row\n\nThe heart of Prescott is bustling Courthouse Square, where the Old West's architecture and spirit are still intact. Whiskey Row makes up the square's western edge. Most of the buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1905, after a massive fire leveled the original block. Locals and visitors takes advantage of pub crawls, festivals and art walks nearly every weekend of the year.\n\n53. Bisbee\n\nThis southeast Arizona community, once a booming copper-mining town, has reinvented itself as a quirky arts community. Most of the lodging offerings are in cool historical buildings downtown or renovated homes and cottages on side streets.\n\n54. Pueblo Grande\n\nThis museum and archaeological site in Phoenix is home to a 1,500-year old Hohokam village. Walk the outdoor trail and explore the structures, and then learn about the Hohokam people in the main gallery. The museum features a gallery and museum store, and provides educational programs.\n\n55. Heritage Square\n\nThe square in downtown Phoenix dates to the late 1800s, shining a light on the city's Victorian past. The Rosson House Museum gives a glimpse of family life in those days. Also in the square are the famous Pizzeria Bianco, high-end Japanese restaurant Nobuo at Teeter House and the Rose & Crown Pub. Concerts, festivals and weddings regularly take place in the square.\n\nGetting out\n\nHere are some reasons to love getting out in Arizona.\n\n56. Phoenix Zoo\n\nVoted a top zoo for kids, the Phoenix Zoo features 125 acres of family-friendly entertainment. Visitors enjoy a variety of interactive experiences, from the Giraffe Encounter to Stingray Bay to the Monkey Village. The Safari Train circles the park as guides offer tips. The zoo also hosts such popular special events such as the ZooLights holiday display.\n\n57. Desert Botanical Garden\n\nLearn about Sonoran Desert plants, trees and flowers as you stroll pathways through cactuses and succulents. There's always something going on, such as the Music in the Garden series, art exhibits, plant sales, workshops and special events such as the holiday luminaria display. Gertrude's restaurant is popular.\n\n58. Pat's Run\n\nThis fundraiser started in a way that almost surely would have met with its namesake's approval — three friends kicking around ideas over beers. Pat Tillman's friends wanted to raise money for the foundation created after Tillman, the former Arizona State University and Arizona Cardinals defensive standout, was killed while serving with the Army Rangers in Afghanistan. Pat's Run now is the largest timed running event in the Southwest U.S. Nearly 30,000 people run and walk 4.2 miles each April to celebrate his spirit and remember his sacrifice.\n\n59. Deer Valley Rock Art Center\n\nMore than 1,500 petroglyphs are scattered around the center in north east Glendale, offering a multifaceted view of the past. The drawings, most made with stone tools thousands of years ago, are open to interpretation. The rock art symbols are found as you walk along the quarter-mile path, which has signs pointing out some of the symbols among the outcroppings of dark andesite.Rock art is a collective name for the types of images created on stone: petroglyphs and pictographs. Petroglyphs are pecked, engraved or polished designs on rock; pictographs are painted or drawn designs on rock.\n\n60. Downtown Phoenix arts scene\n\nThe First Friday art walk has been giving life to galleries and opportunity to artists since 1994. Phoenix's artsy neighborhoods are spread about in typical Valley fashion, with popular areas including the Phoenix Art Museum and Heard Museum; the Roosevelt Row Arts District; and the Lower Grand Avenue Arts and Small Business District. You also will find a vibrant Latino-art scene and skillful graffiti.\n\n61. Sahuaro Ranch\n\nDid you know date-palm trees can live for more than 100 years? They do, and you can see many fine specimens at the Sahuaro Ranch Park Historic Area in Glendale, which also features historical buildings, barnyard and fruit orchards. Tour the historic Main House Museum, built from 1891 to 1898, and learn about the history of the pioneers who lived there.\n\n62. Mystery Castle\n\nThe home at the base of South Mountain was built by Boyce Gulley in the 1930s. He moved from Seattle to Phoenix with a fond memory: building sand castles with his daughter, Mary Lou. He set out to build her a \"permanent sand castle\" using cheap and found materials, including salvaged rail tracks, telephone poles, adobe, automobile parts and stone. Gulley died in 1945; Mary Lou died in 2010. Tours are offered October through May.\n\n63. Scottsdale nightlife\n\nDowntown Scottsdale draws locals and tourists with its Western boutiques, great dining and walkable area. And when the sun goes down, it turns into a partier's paradise. You can drop into a Vegas-style pool club where a top international DJ is performing, walk a couple of doors down to a modern country bar owned by Dierks Bentley, hear a band at an old cowboy saloon, then play arcade games while drinking craft beer.\n\n64. Car auctions\n\nNumerous auctions draw big wheels to the Valley every January. The largest and best known is the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction, which brings in a diverse crowd ranging from international buyers to families looking for a fun day out. Other major auctions include Russo and Steele, Gooding & Co., Bonhams and RM.\n\n65. Waste Management Phoenix Open\n\nThis is the largest tournament on the PGA Tour and known for its rowdy atmosphere. Thousands of fans descend on TPC Scottsdale to sip beer in the sun, show off goofy golf attire and cheer or heckle at the infamous 16th hole. At night, visitors make their way to the Coors Light Birds Nest to party as top bands perform.\n\nHiking\n\nNeed more reasons to love this state? Check out these 10 hikes\n\n66. Camelback Mountain\n\nThe wildly popular Echo Canyon Trail is loved by locals and tourists alike. Any day of the week you can see fitness-minded hikers powering their way around those making their way up for a panoramic view of the Valley. It's a tough hike, with about 1,200 feet of elevation gain over 1.3 miles.\n\n67. Piestewa Peak\n\nThere are several trails in the Phoenix Mountains Park and Recreation Area. The most popular — and most difficult — is the Summit Trail up Piestewa Peak. It's about 1.2 miles to the top and an elevation gain of nearly 1,200 feet.\n\n68. Shoshone Point, Grand Canyon\n\nOn most days, this easy walk through the woods might be the most peaceful place on the South Rim. The flat hike is about a mile along an old Jeep road to a gobsmacking overlook. The small parking area is unmarked, so a lot of people don't realize the trail is there. The point can be reserved for weddings and other events, so if a group has reserved the site you might encounter a crowd.\n\n69. Humphreys Peak\n\nArizona's highest mountain — it tops out at 12,633 feet — offers a lung-searing, heart-pounding hike with amazing views. The trail to the summit winds up the aspen-covered mountain. The last mile, above tree line, is especially challenging as it grows windy, steeper and rockier.\n\n70. Thunder River-Deer Creek Loop, Grand Canyon\n\nThis 28-mile North Rim trek has it all. First, a leisurely walk through the woods and then a skid down a steep gravel slope. Then — ahh — the flat, otherwordly rockscape of the Esplanade. Then — ugh — the Redwall descent. Then Surprise Valley, another reasonably flat and pleasing stretch. Then more downhill until you reach Thunder River, where the water roars out of the Canyon wall and creates a lush microclimate. Soak your feet, because there's still another mile of grinding downhill to the Upper Tapeats campsite. From here to the Colorado River you'll cross Tapeats Creek several times, scramble across a stretch of trail with a sheer drop-off, then pick your way down a rock fall. Good times. The next day it's a few easy miles to Deer Creek Narrows, a fantastic slot canyon. You hike along a ledge near the top of the slot, so watch your step. And get a good rest. Because it's all uphill from here.\n\n71. Aravaipa Canyon\n\nThis peaceful getaway southeast of Globe shows how fertile the desert can be when you add water. A creek waters a canopy of trees, creating a cool, shady ecosystem. Trails vanish into thickets, pushing hikers into the creek. To keep the canyon special, the Bureau of Land Management limits visitation and requires a permit.\n\n72. Superstition Mountains\n\nGrisly murders, strange disappearances and legends of lost mines have given the Superstition Mountains an ominous reputation. But the 160,000-acre wilderness holds some of the best hiking in Arizona, with everything from jagged cliffs and deeply shadowed canyons to rolling, pine-covered hills and seasonal creeks. And its 200 miles of interconnecting trails make it easy to plan a hike for every skill and adventure level.\n\n73. Cathedral Rock\n\nAs you approach Sedona from the south, this dramatic cream- and salmon-colored formation stands as a sort of gateway to the backcountry marvels beyond. See for yourself by hiking the Cathedral Rock Trail up to the base of the cliffs and pillars at the center of the formation. Although it's only about three-quarters of a mile long, the trail gains more than 700 feet of elevation.\n\n74. Wind Cave Trail\n\nThis trail begins in Usery Mountain Regional Park and enters Tonto National Forest. The wide, sandy trail zigzags through lush desert, steadily gaining elevation. As it steepens, it leads along the base of lichen-stained cliffs to the cave. A handful of plants cling to the ceiling, where water seeps through the rock.\n\n75. Arizona Trail\n\nThe Arizona National Scenic Trail is like an 800-mile sampler of everything Arizona has to offer. The trail's 43 \"passages\" range in length from 8.3 miles to 36 miles and link the Mexican border south of Parker Lake in the Huachuca Mountains to the Utah state line beyond the Grand Canyon. They traverse mountain ranges, grasslands, desert, forests, wilderness areas and canyons.\n\nWeather\n\nFrom summer storms to fair winters, here are 10 reasons to love Arizona weather.\n\n76. Beauty in the skies\n\nWhile summer storms can be dangerous (and should be viewed from indoors), there is beauty there, too. Monsoon clouds appear heavenly and white as they build over the eastern mountains, then transform to dark and menacing with angry flashes of lightning that paints electrifying pictures across the summer sky. And then, when the night sky clears, you don't have to travel far from the Valley for breathtaking views of the heavens.\n\n77. Dining al fresco in winter\n\nDuring the heat of summer, most Valley residents want to spend as much time in air-conditioned spaces as possible. But during the rest of the year, conditions are great for dining outdoors. Metro Phoenix has a great variety of eating establishments small and large that feature outdoor dining, some with incredible city, mountain and desert vistas.\n\n78. Experiencing all 4 seasons\n\nArizona residents can experience all four seasons, sometimes in just a few hours. Traveling from the desert floor to Arizona's \"sky islands\" can take you from searing heat to snowy peak in the time it takes to drive to Flagstaff, which is the place to be for vibrant fall colors as well as snowball fights in the winter. In spring, the wildflowers near Picacho Peak can't be beat, but if it's summer you want, well, welcome to Arizona, because we've got plenty of that.\n\n79. Fall and winter festivals\n\nDuring the fall, winter and early spring, Arizonans like to get outdoors to participate in fairs, festivals and other special events. Nearly every weekend during the cooler months features some sort of outdoor event, whether its food, or music or even medieval jousting at the Renaissance Faire.\n\n80. Creosote bush\n\nRepublic columnist Clay Thompson was once asked about the \"pleasantly sweet smell\" that comes from the desert after a rain. His guess was the Creosote bush. Its stems and leaves are covered with a waxy substance that includes naphthalene, which protects the plant from ultraviolet rays and helps it hold in water. \"Moisture activates the waxy coating and produces that wonderful smell,\" he explained.\n\n81. 90 degrees\n\nHave you ever noticed how 90 degrees in the summer doesn't feel the same as 90 degrees in spring? After suffering through temperatures of 105-plus during July and August, it's almost blissful when the day comes that it only gets as high as 90. But head from winter into spring with temperatures suddenly spiking to 90 degrees and, it's starting to feel pretty warm.\n\n82. It really is a dry heat\n\nThen again, so is a sauna. Still, it's nice to be able to hang your laundry on the line and have it dry in 20 minutes.\n\n83. Skiing\n\nWater. Downhill. Cross-country. You can do all three kinds of skiiing in Arizona, sometimes on the same day if you're willing to do a little driving. Arizona Snowbowl and Sunrise Park Resort are popular ski destinations, along with Mount Lemmon Ski Valley near Tucson. You can cross-country ski along the Mogollon Rim near Payson, and the major lakes on the Salt and Verde rivers offer water skiing year-round.\n\n84. Swimming season never ends\n\nDespite the way it may look when you fly into Sky Harbor International Airport, everyone in Arizona does not have a swimming pool. But they probably know someone who does. If not, they can take advantage of the dozens of resort pools that are open year-round or splash in one of the Valley's famous water parks. Back in the old days, kids used to swim in the canals that provide water to the Valley, but these days that's frowned upon. Still, if you can't find a cool place for a dip on a summer day, you're not trying very hard.\n\n85. Backdrop for big events\n\nPleasant fall and winter temperatures draw people to Arizona from across the world. That climate is also an important lure for big-time sporting events such as the Super Bowl or the Phoenix Open professional golf tournament and spring-training baseball.\n\nEating and drinking\n\nThe Arizona Republic has been helping Arizonans for the past 125 know where and what to eat and drink.\n\nHere are 10 reasons worth toasting:\n\n86. Mexican food\n\nThere's no need to travel south of the border for authentic Mexican food. We serve it right here. For decades, Arizona restaurants have been dishing up Mexico's signature dishes.

Yet a devoted band of farmers is turning swatches of desert into bountiful gardens, proving that, yes, locally grown fruits and vegetables are better. Our farmers sell their harvest to chefs and at nearly 30 farmers markets Valley-wide. Here are three operations hard at work:\n\n•McClendon's Select, 15888 N. 77th Ave., Peoria. 623-979-5279, mcclendonsselect.com.\n\n•Maya's Farm, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix. 480-236-7097, mayasfarm.com.\n\n•Singh Farms, 8900 E.

Today, we're loaded with talented chefs. As proof, check out the eight Arizona chefs who have won the James Beard best chef-Southwest award, the culinary version of an Academy Award.\n\nThe chefs are: Chris Bianco, Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, 2003; Nobuo Fukuda, Nobuo at Teeter House in Phoenix, 2007; Christopher Gross, Christopher's of Christopher's Restaurant & Crush Lounge in Phoenix, 1995; Vincent Guerithault, Vincent on Camelback in Phoenix, 1993; RoxSand Scocos McCreary, formerly of RoxSand Restaurant in Phoenix, 1999; Robert McGrath, formerly of Roaring Fork in Scottsdale, 2001; Bradford Thompson, formerly of Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician in Phoenix, 2006; Janos Wilder, Janos, Tucson, 2000.\n\n89. Craft beer\n\nMove over citrus, copper and cotton. There's a new industry in the state, and it's booming. Arizona has more than 60 licensed craft breweries, ringing up an estimated $650 million in sales a year, according to the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild.

Wine\n\nArizona's wine industry was small and sleepy — until 2001. Since then, winemaking has soared. Production has increased nearly 700 percent in the past 14 years, well above the national average. At the same time, the state's reputation for quality wines has skyrocketed.\n\nThere are 75 licensed wineries in Arizona, many offering tasting rooms at the vineyards. Check out arizonawine.org for locations. Here are three top winemakers:\n\n•Arizona Stronghold Vineyards: 1023 N. Main St., Cottonwood. 928-639-2789.\n\n•Page Springs Cellars: 1500 N. Page Springs Road, Cornville. 928-639-3004.\n\n•Callaghan Vineyards: 336 Elgin Road, Elgin. 520-455-5322.\n\n91. Native American cuisine\n\nThe state's first cooks were Native Americans. Thankfully, a handful of restaurants are working hard to keep the cuisine of Native American forebears alive:\n\n•White Mountain Apache Tribe's Sunrise Park Resort: Chef Nephi Craig and his all-Native American kitchen staff host dinners to showcase the cuisine of their ancestors. Reservations for the indigenous-food chef-table dinner: 928-735-7669, ext. 2288.\n\n•Fry Bread House: Credit Army rations for Navajo fry bread. These flour-and-grease creations were created by enterprising Native American women in the 19th century with the rations the Army handed out to those relegated to reservations.

Cactus League baseball\n\nOn March 30, 1909, the Chicago White Stockings became the first major-league team to play a barnstorming game in Arizona. The concept of spring training here didn't really take off for another 40 or so years, but from those first roots blossomed an experience that includes half of Major League Baseball and sets annual attendance records across the Valley.\n\n97. The big four play here\n\nThe Phoenix area is home to all four men's major pro sports leagues, making us one of only a dozen markets in the country that can make that boast.\n\n98. You're covered\n\nThere is no such thing as a rainout or bad weather when it comes to our pro sports franchises. Domed stadiums, a necessity given Arizona's challenging summers, not only guarantee fan comfort but also that the games will go on. Added bonus: Fans don't have to get bundled up and trudge through snow to watch hockey here!\n\n99. Golf mecca\n\nClimate is one of the Five C's of Arizona that built our economy and why we are a year-round golfing destination. Try this formula as an example: 50 or so golf courses in Scottsdale and another 150 in the surrounding area, times 330 days of sunshine, equals an estimated 8.28 million rounds of golf per year on those tracks, per City of Scottsdale data.\n\n100. The great outdoors\n\nMuch of the Arizona sports experience doesn't take place in a stadium or arena, but happens all year long under our sunny skies. If you are a water enthusiast, pilot your boat on one of more than three dozen lakes and reservoirs, plus the Colorado River, or float in an inner tube down the Salt River. Hunters can go for game big or small in the deserts, mountains and forests; fishing opportunities are too numerous to mention here. And hiking and camping experiences offer plenty of diverse terrain, vistas and wildlife encounters.\n\n101. Mega events call Arizona home\n\nSuper Bowls. National championship football. All-star games. And now the Final Four around the corner. The Phoenix area, simply, is where America comes to put on its biggest sports events.\n\n102. Pickleball\n\nParticipants use paddles to hit a ball over a low net on a badminton-sized court. Pickleball is touted as one of the fasted growing sports in the country. The USA Pickleball Association, organized to promote the growth and development of the sport, has its home in Surprise. Although the sport has captured the hearts of those living in retirement communities and RV Parks, a younger crowd is getting in on the action.\n\n103. We're World Series champions\n\nArizona Diamondbacks win the 2001 World Series: The seven-game series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees included two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7, bases-loaded walk-off single from Luis Gonzalez. Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were co-MVPs.\n\n104. Weather, or not\n\nIf you have a hankering to play outside, you don't have to let a little thing like Mother Nature interfere. Valley residents enjoying 80-degree winter days can drive two hours to find snow skiing; Flagstaff-area folks can shake off the cold by driving two hours the other way to find a sunny golf course waiting.\n\n105. Go bowling\n\nSince 1971, there has been at least one college football bowl game in Arizona every season, with a second game added in 1989 and a third on Tucson's wish list. If that happens, the state will host four bowls this winter, capped by the second College Football Playoff title game in Glendale on Jan. 11.\n\nPeople and innovations\n\nMade in Arizona. From a young state isolated from the outside by mountain, canyon and desert have grown remarkable ideas, people and innovations.\n\nHere are 10 people and innovations to love that have come from Arizona.\n\n106. Carl Hayden\n\nHayden represented Arizona for 57 years in Congress, 42 of them as a senator. He was instrumental in passing landmark legislation, including a constitutional amendment assuring the right to vote for women and creation of Social Security.\n\n107. Pima cotton\n\nPima cotton, known for its elegance and durability, was developed on experimental farms near Sacaton. During World War I, the U.S. military liked Pima cotton because of its industrial strength: It was used in airplane wheels, uniforms and wing fabric, among other uses. Now Pima cotton is a go-to material for shirts, towels and sheets.\n\n108. John F. Long\n\nValley developer John F. Long created the affordable housing community, Maryvale, in the 1950s. Long donated land for schools, community centers and parks and had a profound effect on West Valley growth. He died Feb. 29, 2008 at age 87.\n\n109. Navajo Code Talkers\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese intelligence officers kept intercepting and deciphering coded messages, allowing enemy troops and sailors to anticipate attacks. The Pentagon turned to the Navajo Nation. Twenty-nine young men were recruited into the Marine Corps and developed a code using their native tongue, Diné. Its unusual syntax and rules of grammar baffled the Japanese, and America finally gained the advantage of surprise in combat.\n\n110. Active retirement communities\n\nThe new concept of a senior-living community and Arizona's reputation as a retirement haven were spurred by the opening of Sun City by the Del Webb Corp. in 1960. The new community was a hit from the start, as thousands thronged to tour model homes in a community with a host of recreational amenities that redefined the lifestyle of older Americans.\n\n111. Cesar Chavez\n\nBorn near Yuma, Chavez saw his family lose their farm when he was a young child. His parents became migrant workers, and he grew up to become co-founder of the United Farm Workers Union in 1962. Committed to non-violence, he organized boycotts and strikes of agricultural products to bring national attention to the cause of farmworkers' rights.\n\n112. Jet Skis\n\nNext time you're at the lake, take a moment to remember Clayton Jacobson II. In the 1960s, the man who spent many years living in Parker came up with the idea for a personal watercraft powered by internal pump jets. His invention would later be manufactured and trademarked as Sea-Doos and Jet Skis, with sit-down and stand-up models.\n\n113. Tree-ring dating\n\nShort of jumping in a time machine, in the 1800s there was no method to pinpoint dates in archaeology and paleontology — until an Arizona scientist got involved. Lowell Observatory astronomer A.E. Douglass began developing the system of dendrochronology — the science of using tree rings, the growth patterns formed in a cross-section of the trunk — in Flagstaff in the 1890s. Almost 50 years later, he founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Tree-ring dating is still used today, and has become a key tool in studying climate change.\n\n114. America West Airlines\n\nThis startup low-fare airline founded after industry deregulation began flights in 1983 with three aircraft, but its expansion was derailed by a 1991 bankruptcy. It was the first airline to apply for and receive a federal loan after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks. America West purchased carrier US Airways out of bankruptcy in 2005. The renamed US Airways completed a long-sought merger with American Airlines and moved its headquarters to Fort Worth in 2013.\n\n115. Star-gazing discoveries\n\nArizona has been at the forefront of space discoveries and NASA missions. Clear skies and low humidity make the state an ideal site for stargazing, drawing scientists and researchers from around the world. Kitt Peak National Observatory, which is 56 miles southwest of Tucson, has contributed to numerous scientific discoveries, including galaxy rotation curves, galaxy evolution and environment, and research about star formation. According to its website, KPNO has the world's largest collection of optical telescopes.\n\nPoints of Pride\n\nArizona can boast of many attractions, moments of pride and sons and daughters of accomplishment. Next time you want to exercise bragging rights, think Grand Canyon. That big hole in the ground drew more than 4.7 million visitors in 2014. As for manmade attractions, there's the mammoth Hoover Dam or that bridge from London that was torn apart and reassembled in Lake Havasu City. We have plenty of folks to admire, including one who spent decades on the Supreme Court.\n\nHere are 10 points of pride in Arizona:\n\n116. Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum\n\nThe 98-acre Desert Museum, which was founded in 1952, is billed as a fusion experience: zoo, botanical garden, art gallery, natural history museum, and aquarium. It is considered a model for innovative presentation and interpretation of native plants and animals in ecological exhibits. Visit and you can go along two miles of walking paths that take you through various desert habitats. At the museum, you may spot 230 animal species and 1,200 types of plants.\n\n117. Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center\n\nCutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center: From 1922 to 1949, this cluster of white buildings at First and Culver streets was home of Congregation Beth Israel. It then become Phoenix's first Chinese-speaking Christian church and then was sold to a Hispanic church. Today it is owned by the Arizona Jewish Historical Society, which operates it as a museum, gallery and cultural center.\n\n118. Miss Arizona becomes Miss America\n\nIt happened not once but twice. It was a banner front page headline on Sept. 11, 1949. A photo showed the winner, Jacque Mercer, with a parasol, her hoop dress puffed around her. Arizona won the 1965 Miss America title with Vonda Kay Van Dyke.\n\n119. Canal system\n\nDesert dwellers need water to survive, and the Valley might never have been created without the dedication of the Hohokam Indians. Salt River Project officials say the Hohokams set the groundwork for today's extensive canal system, which follows many of the same routes.\n\n120. London Bridge\n\nIn 1968, Lake Havasu City founder Robert P. McCulloch paid $2.4 million to buy the 137-year-old London Bridge, which was sinking and had to be replaced. The bridge was dismantled and shipped via the Panama Canal to California, then trucked to Lake Havasu City and reassembled.\n\n121. Arizona Highways magazine\n\nThe magazine was started in April 1925 to attract tourists. Over the years, the beauty and stories of Arizona have drawn tourists to discover in person what they found among the pages. It has more than 1 million readers today.\n\n122. Women's suffrage\n\nEight years before the nation, Arizona men voted to allow Arizona women the right to vote. The initiative won by a healthy margin and was decided in fall 1912, during the state's first election after obtaining statehood.\n\n123. Old Tucson\n\nIf you have a hankering to visit the old West, Old Tucson should be on your bucket list. Even if you've never been there in person, you may well have seen it in movie or television show. In 2014, the attraction celebrated its 75th anniversary of the building of the original Old Tucson sets in 1939 by Columbia Pictures for the movie, \"Arizona.\" Over the years, millions of people have come to wander into the general merchantile store and other businesses in town, catch a gunfight on the dusty streets and or watch a can-can or two in the saloon.\n\n124. Buffalo Soldiers\n\nIn 1913, a fort in the Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona became home to the Army's 10th Cavalry, one of two African-American cavalry units Native Americans referred to as Buffalo Soldiers. The units were formed in 1866, while the Army was segregated, to help control the frontier.\n\n125. Mission San Xavier del Bac\n\nIf you are headed to Tucson, why not include in your visit, this mission. It's just 9 miles south of downtown Tucson. Another plus: no admission charge but many people will leave a donation after seeing what some say is the finest example of Spanish Colonial architecture in the United States. The mission, which is designated a National Historic Landmark, was founded as a Catholic mission by Father Eusebio Kino in 1692. Construction of the current church began in 1783 and was completed in 1797. Its interior is filled with original statuary and mural paintings. Today, it continues to minister to the religious needs of its parishioners.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/14/convention-fight-great-white-isolation-island-news-around-states/112226300/", "title": "Convention fight, Great White: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Republican leader of the state Senate said he used a poor choice of words when he suggested he wanted more people to get infected with the new coronavirus. “It was a poor choice of words on my end,” Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh told the Associated Press, saying he didn’t wish for anyone to become ill. Last week Marsh drew criticism after he suggested more infections meant the state was closer to herd immunity. “I’m not as concerned so much as the number of cases; in fact, quite honestly, I want to see more people because we start reaching an immunity as more people have it and get through it,” Marsh told news outlets. Herd immunity is when enough people have contracted a disease and developed immunity that the virus cannot spread easily. But doctors have cautioned that they don’t yet know if COVID-19 survivors have long-term immunity.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: There were 116 new COVID-19 cases reported across the state Sunday – its highest daily increase so far. There was one new hospitalization and no new deaths reported in Alaska, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The state Department of Health and Social Services said 93 of the new cases involved Alaska residents, and 23 involved nonresidents. The new cases reported Sunday break a previous record set the day before, when the state reported 77 cases. The reason for Sunday’s increase was not immediately clear. It was not known if patients were showing symptoms or how sick they were at the time of testing. Alaska has reported 1,774 cases of COVID-19 statewide, with 847 active cases. There have been 86 people hospitalized as a result of the virus since March, and 17 residents have died.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: More than 60 firefighters with the Phoenix Fire Department have tested positive for the coronavirus. “We have had multiple positive cases in the past week, a truly alarming amount,” P.J. Dean, a spokesman for United Phoenix Firefighters Association, told Phoenix radio station KTAR FM. Phoenix Fire is the nation’s fifth-largest fire department with 60 fire stations serving Arizona’s largest city. As of Tuesday, the department had reported 62 positive COVID-19 cases among firefighters. Another 100 members out of 1,585 are currently quarantined during the testing process, awaiting their results, and seven civilian members have also tested positive. “It’s challenging. In my 25 years of experience, I’ve never seen anything like this,” Dean said. Every third day, city firefighters report to duty for at least 24 hours and share a fire station with a variety of people while sleeping, eating and living together.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 503 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and eight additional deaths related to the new coronavirus. State health officials said the total number of confirmed cases climbed to 28,367. The death toll for the outbreak, which officials began tracking in early March, was 321 on Sunday. The true number of cases in Arkansas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Arkansas’ virus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses to reopen. As of Sunday, there were more than 6,400 active cases in the state, and nearly 21,600 people who had contracted COVID-19 have recovered, according to health officials.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A heat wave brought crowds to the state’s beaches, where people mostly heeded warnings to keep a safe distance from each other as the state grappled with a spike in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations. “It’s a busy day at the beach, but people are spread out, for the most part,” said Chief Jason Young with Orange County Lifeguards. Temperatures soared into the 90s over the weekend in many areas from San Diego north to the San Francisco Bay Area. The rural community of Paicines inland from Monterey recorded a high of 102, the National Weather Service said. Young said lifeguards were educating the public on guidelines to stay about 6 feet apart to help curb the spread of the virus. In Santa Monica, Mercedes Benns said she was relieved to see the majority of people wearing masks in the beachside city. “People are keeping away from each other as best they can,” Benns said. “Everyone’s being respectful.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: UCHealth expects to begin recruiting 1,000 patients at high risk of contracting COVID-19 to participate in a vaccine trial in the next few weeks. Researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and UCHealth on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver will be testing the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine to establish its efficacy and safety. It is the first COVID-19 trial launched in Colorado and the first for UCHealth, spokeswoman Kelly Tracer said. Unlike traditional vaccines that expose participants to a small amount of virus, this vaccine focuses on the genetic code of the coronavirus and its spike protein, said Dr. Thomas Campbell, an infectious disease doctor at the CU School of Medicine and University of Colorado Hospital. The recruitment period will last about two months, and the call will go out through UCHealth’s My Health Connection patient portal.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Several state parks closed their gates before noon Sunday after quickly reaching their visitor limits. The state has reduced by half the number of people allowed in the parks during the coronavirus pandemic to allow for social distancing. By Sunday morning, at least eight parks, including Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme and Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, were already at capacity, NBC Connecticut reports. The state’s coronavirus transmission rate is among the lowest in the country, and the state has reported few virus deaths in recent days. At its peak April 20, Connecticut recorded 204 coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: A popular Rehoboth Beach deli has temporarily closed after two employees were possibly exposed to individuals who may have the coronavirus. Owner Warren S. Rosenfeld announced on Facebook on Monday afternoon that he would be closing Rosenfeld’s Jewish Deli for at least 10 days. He did not say in the post if the coronavirus exposure came from other employees, customers or friends or family of the staffers. “Two staff members may have been exposed to others exhibiting signs of COVID,” the post said. “The staff no longer feels comfortable there until COVID testing of all staff members is completed, and results received.” Rosenfeld said the restaurant was closing “even though those others have yet to receive definitive word on their condition.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has declared beekeepers to be essential workers during the coronavirus outbreak, WUSA-TV reports. Spring and summer is when beehives will “swarm,” meaning a queen will take half the hive to make a new hive. If the swarm isn’t collected by a beekeeper, the new hive can come to settle in residential backyards, attics, crawlspaces or other potentially ruinous areas. And that can create a stinging, scary nuisance. Beekeepers respond to swarms and carefully transplant them to designated areas such as community gardens, rooftops and even embassies in Washington. American honeybee colonies have bounced back after a bad year, an annual beekeeping survey finds. Beekeepers only lost 22.2% of their colonies this past winter, lower than the average of 28.6%, according to the Bee Informed Partnership’s annual survey of thousands of beekeepers. It was the second-smallest winter loss in 14 years of surveying.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Officials shut down two strip clubs as part of a statewide crackdown on violators of an emergency order that forced bars to close in the face of rising coronavirus cases. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation suspended the licenses of Le Palace Otown in Orlando and Show N Tail The Legend in Panama City Beach, saying patrons didn’t observe social distancing guidelines. In both cases, the orders said DBPR had the authority to suspend a license if there is an “immediate health to the public health, safety or welfare.” In the case of Le Palace Otown, state regulators said, the bar was in violation of the terms of both the governor’s executive order for Phase 2 as well as the DBPR emergency order two weeks ago shutting bars back down. The business failed to observe social distancing guidelines, the order said. Show N Tail required customers to pay a cover charge, which entitled them to a “free” alcoholic beverage and to “observe any adult entertainment,” according to its suspension order.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of people in Georgia who have died after contracting the coronavirus has reached 3,001, according to data released Sunday by the state Department of Public Health. Confirmed cases and hospitalizations have been rising sharply in the state over the past few weeks. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has been locked in a battle with local officials over whether they have the power to implement virus restrictions that go beyond his orders. Kemp says no, but local governments across the state are doing it anyway, with several cities including Atlanta implementing mask requirements and other restrictions. More than 2,500 new confirmed cases of the virus were reported Sunday, according to the health department. That brings the total number of confirmed cases to nearly 117,000, though experts say official counts likely only capture a fraction of those who have been infected. As of Sunday, 2,512 people with the virus were hospitalized in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials organizing events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II say the coronavirus has not derailed the plans. Planners expect to follow through with the schedule of Victory over Japan Day, or V-J Day, events Aug. 29 through Sept. 2 as uncertainty remains about COVID-19 health restrictions, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The theme of the events is “Salute Their Service, Honor Their Hope,” and the schedule includes several warplane flyovers and a ceremony on or next to the battleship Missouri, on which the U.S. accepted Japan’s unconditional surrender Sept. 2, 1945. Tony Vericella, executive director of the 75th World War II Commemoration Committee in Hawaii, said that as of last week, more than 30 World War II veterans from outside Hawaii and their family members had committed to attending the events in Oahu. Vericella said the participation of veterans and others from the continental U.S. relies on the state lifting a 14-day self-quarantine for out-of-state travelers, which would be replaced with a mandate for visitors to undergo COVID-19 screening tests prior to arriving.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling rejecting his request to put on hold a court order forcing the state to count online signatures for an initiative backers hope to get on the November ballot. The Republican governor announced the decision not long after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his request last week. “We will continue our efforts to preserve the integrity of Idaho’s duly enacted laws and to prevent the disruption to our upcoming elections that this decision will cause,” Little said in a statement. Reclaim Idaho, a group that backs initiatives, in the lawsuit filed last month said that Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March due to the coronavirus pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature gathering.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Health officials have put a mobile COVID-19 testing station outside a suburban Chicago high school as the area sees an uptick in cases among younger residents, a trend that has happened elsewhere in the country. The site, outside Lake Zurich High School’s Performing Arts Center, operated Sunday and will be open next weekend, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Lake County Health Department said there’s been a spike in coronavirus cases of people under age 30 while cases among the general population remained steady. Multiple cases were reported among participants attending the first day of a sports camp at Lake Zurich High School and other recent social gatherings. On Sunday, Illinois public health officials announced 954 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 20 deaths across the state. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 153,916 cases and 7,187 deaths. The state reported 38,894 tests Sunday with an average seven-day positive rate of 3%.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After announcing plans to reopen as scheduled, Washington Township Schools said Monday that it will not bring students back into classrooms to start the new school year due to an increasing number of coronavirus cases. The school district’s board voted Monday to continue with virtual classes, “while coronavirus indicators increase.” Washington Township serves more than 11,000 students on Indianapolis’ northside. Just last week, the board had approved a plan that would reopen its classrooms for in-person instruction with requirements for masks, social distancing and other safety measures. Then, cases in Indiana started to increase. At the end of last week, the state saw the highest numbers of new coronavirus cases since early May and increases in the percent of COVID-19 tests coming back positive. In a statement released Monday, the board said it had to do what it believed was best for its students and staff members.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s gross domestic product fell 3.5% in the first quarter, led by a hurting arts and entertainment sector of the economy, according to a new report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Iowa City’s Englert Theatre – one of the oldest entertainment venues in the state – estimated a loss of $385,213 between March through May, a figure that represents approximately 20% of the nonprofit’s typical gross annual revenues, as the coronavirus outbreak forced venues and other businesses to shut their doors. In response, the Englert joined the National Independent Venue Association, a collection of roughly 2,000 performance venues across the nation created to urge Congress to give more support to the ailing industry. NIVA representatives say they expect to see as much as 90% of businesses within its membership close permanently by the end of the year.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The Kansas State Fair Board voted Monday to cancel this year’s fair amid the coronavirus pandemic. Its reversal came a week after the board initially voted to continue with the fair, sparking concern from vendors and the community about the COVID-19 pandemic. “We appreciate the thoughtful consideration you gave to open the fair as safely as possible. After that, we heard from a number of vendors who were genuinely concerned,” Kansas State Fair general manager Robin Jennison said. About half the vendors had canceled amid worries about delays with travel quarantines, difficulties in putting crews together and cancellations of other fairs. Jennison said last week that it was beginning to appear the fair would be financially worse off going forward than not having it. The organization cannot operate in the red. The board is still interested in finding a way to safely hold livestock and 4H events.\n\nKentucky\n\nLeitchfield: Grayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins has a message for the rest of the Bluegrass State: Wear a mask. You don’t want to go through what he’s going through. Chaffins had been in bed for the past six days, he wrote in a lengthy Facebook post published Sunday, after contracting COVID-19 recently. He’s still fighting to recover, he wrote. “I consider myself a tough guy,” Chaffins wrote. “But I am telling you that It brought me down QUICK and there is nothing I can do about it.” Two of his family members have had mild symptoms, he said, but he was hit harder. The family returned to Leitchfield on July 4 after a vacation out west, where he believes he contracted the virus, and while it started with just a mild fever, Chaffins said his symptoms worsened as the week went on. Chaffins said his sheriff’s department isn’t going to enforce Gov. Andy Beshear’s mask mandate, but those in the community should still wear masks as a courtesy to others.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: The state’s public school students, teachers and adults in grades three through 12 will be required to wear masks as part of the Department of Education’s minimum safety standards it will present to the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on Tuesday. The education department and BESE are required to produce the standards by a new law passed by the Legislature on June 30 and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said the new law provided BESE with the authority to enact mask mandates and other standards. “I really feel good about our plan,” Brumley said Saturday. “It’s something as a team we’ve spent countless hours to get right and hand in hand with the Louisiana Department of Health (and others). We wanted to give systems a road map, but at the same time we wanted to provide some degree of flexibility.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: An island that once served as a quarantine site during the Spanish flu is being marketed as a refuge from the coronavirus for a cool $250,000 a week, plus expenses. Portland entrepreneur Noah Gordon planned to host high-end weddings on the 12 acres he purchased for $4.5 million on House Island. Now he’s marketing it as a coronavirus-free safety zone. House Island sits just offshore, between South Portland and Peaks Island. And it’s a quick helicopter ride from the mainland. Staff at the island will follow health protocols ensuring a “safe haven bubble of privacy, safety and security where guests can socialize, party and play,” according to promotional materials. “It’s not that safety is the new luxury. Safety is luxury,” Gordon said. The island was the site of the city’s inspection and quarantine station between 1907 and 1937.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: More restaurants and bars are closing their doors as staffers continue to test positive for COVID-19. On Saturday, the Blu Crabhouse and Raw Bar announced it would close for business until further notice after a member of its staff contracted the disease. Buxy’s Salty Dog Saloon and Dry Dock 28 also shut down at 7 p.m. Saturday and will remain closed until Wednesday. The two are the latest Ocean City establishments to close down until further notice citing concerns of the virus spreading. On Friday, Fish Tales, the Longboard Cafe and the Purple Moose Saloon announced they would close with multiple staffers testing positive. The Original Crabcake Factory in Ocean City has also discontinued its bar and indoor dining services until further notice following a violation of social distancing and face mask policy. The Crab Bag and Bull on the Beach announced indoor dining will be discontinued.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gyms are welcoming back members and the iconic duck boat tours are rolling out again as the city enters the third phase of its coronavirus economic restart. Boston began Phase 3 on Monday, a week after most of the rest of Massachusetts, allowing museums, movie theaters, historical sites and gyms to reopen with certain restrictions. The New England Aquarium and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum are among those expected to reopen this week. Boston Duck Tours were also restarting Monday. The company said it’s limiting the number of people on the duck boats so guests can socially distance and requiring face masks for staff and guests. Pat Smith, co-founder of a South Boston gym that reopens Monday, told The Boston Globe that most of its members have said they feel safe to return to working out in person. “People are ready to roll, and get back to a little bit of normalcy,” said Smith of Lifted Fitness.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Protesters who said they’re concerned about the coronavirus blocked a driveway used by buses Monday on the first day of summer classes in the city’s school district. Protesters held signs and placed tree branches on the ground to try to prevent buses from picking up children. WWJ-AM quoted two bus drivers as saying they quit on the spot. “I’m not going back until this pandemic is defeated. There is no safe way to return to school while this virus is spreading uncontained,” teacher Benjamin Royal said. It wasn’t immediately clear how many students, if any, couldn’t get to school because of the protest. Detroit Public Schools Community District said it’s offering in-person or online morning classes in 26 schools, through Aug. 6. Students and staff are required to wear masks. The district said classrooms would be limited to 10 to 15 students per teacher.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: People who qualify to be designated as “essential caregivers” will be allowed to visit family members in senior living centers under new guidance Friday from the state health department that loosens restrictions that have kept loved ones under a near-lockdown for four months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Long-term care facilities such as nursing homes will be able to designate family members or others as essential caregivers so they can resume visits with precautions, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said. The tight restrictions imposed in mid-March were “difficult but very essential” to protect residents and staff, but they came with their own costs in loneliness, quality of life and health risks resulting from that social isolation, Malcolm told reporters. “People are suffering, and they’re dying from COVID-19, but also from loneliness,” said Cheryl Hennan, the state ombudsman at the Office of Long-Term Care at the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students are scheduled to return to school in August amid rising cases of COVID-19 in the state, but campus life will be a lot different from what many are used to. At Mississippi State, temperature check-in kiosks will be scattered around campus. Students who live in dorms will be required to log their temperature every 24 hours and fill out a health questionnaire. Employees and day students will be required to check temperatures at home and take a screening survey before arriving on campus. At Mississippi State and the University of Mississippi, all members of the community will be required to wear masks inside and out of the classroom, where class sizes will be reduced by 50%. “While we remain focused on preserving the on-campus experience, COVID-19 has forced us to rethink everything we do,” University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce said in a letter to the campus community in late June.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge has rejected a motion that would have immediately made it easier for Missourians to vote with a mail-in ballot during the coronavirus pandemic. Cole County Judge Jon Beetem denied the motion Friday for a preliminary injunction sought by the Missouri NAACP and the League of Women Voters, the Jefferson City News-Tribune reports. At issue is how voting will work as public health officials urge people to social distance to avoid spreading COVID-19. The lawsuit seeks to allow all Missourians to cast absentee ballots without notarization in 2020. Under a new law, people considered at risk of the coronavirus – those age 65 and older, living in a long-term care facility or with certain existing health problems – can vote absentee without having their ballot notarized. The Missouri Supreme Court sent the lawsuit back for further review, ruling last month that Beetem was wrong to dismiss it. Beetem said the groups presented no new arguments.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County in central Montana has issued a public health order limiting indoor events to 250 people and outdoor events to 500. The Cascade City-County Health Department issued the order Friday that also requires organizers of events with 100 to 500 people to submit an event packet for approval before the event can take place. Officials say the restrictions are reasonable and intended to protect the community from the coronavirus. Two more deaths due to the coronavirus were reported Monday in Montana, bringing the new statewide total to 32 people who have died because of the respiratory illness. The state reported 85 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing its total to 1,843. Officials have attributed the increase to more testing being done statewide but also have said people are not as vigilant about protecting themselves from the respiratory illness as they once were.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s three largest counties plan to send ballot request forms to every voter before this fall’s general election, but it’s not yet clear whether those forms will be sent statewide as they were before the primary. Officials in Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties say they are planning to send out the ballot-request forms because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and because it will help them plan for the election. Nebraska also has 11 rural counties that routinely vote entirely by mail. Heavy use of mail-in ballots during the May primary helped the state set a record for turnout when more than 471,000 people voted. Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen told The Omaha World-Herald he hasn’t decided whether to send out ballot request forms to every registered voter in the state. Gov. Pete Ricketts doesn’t think it is necessary to send out the forms this fall, spokesman Taylor Gage said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s unemployment benefits call center in Las Vegas has closed for cleaning after officials said an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus. The state Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation announced Sunday that the unidentified person was self-quarantined and that there was no immediate risk to the public because the facility had been closed to outsiders since mid-March. Agency official Kimberly Gaa said claims usually handled by the southern Nevada office will be routed to the unemployment insurance call center in Carson City, and the closure will remain in effect until coronavirus protocols are met. Officials say the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance system and call center aren’t affected. People filing regular jobless claims were advised to use online services as much as possible during non-peak hours such as early mornings, nights or weekends.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Nashua’s face-covering ordinance and the governor’s declaration of a state of emergency because of the coronavirus will stand while they’re being challenged in court, a judge ruled Monday. Andrew Cooper, a Nashua resident, had filed a request for a preliminary injunction as part of his lawsuit seeing to end Gov. Chris Sununu’s emergency declaration and the city’s rules requiring members of the public ages 10 and older to wear face masks when entering any business, work site or government building. He argued that Sununu lacked the authority to make the declaration because “there is no ‘emergency’ in New Hampshire,” a claim that Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge Jacalyn Colburn said defied common sense. “As anyone not living in a cave for the past few months would know, the State, the Country, and the entire world are in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic event,” she wrote in denying the motion.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday that the state would lift the 50% capacity limit that has been enforced on NJ Transit and private carrier buses, trains, light rail and Access Link. That order has been in effect since March to help mitigate the spread of the virus but will be lifted Wednesday at 8 p.m. Murphy also said face coverings will be required at all indoor stations and outdoor stations where social distancing isn’t possible, as well as in the transit vehicles. “We are seeing increases in ridership that are beginning to approach 50% of the stated maximum capacity of these vehicles, and we want to ensure that people can get to their jobs and that the system continues operating as efficiently as possible,” Murphy said. He said that in a “perfect world” there would be more tunnels under the Hudson River so more trains could run and keep the capacity lower.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State health officials reported an additional 262 COVID-19 cases and two more confirmed deaths Sunday. That increased the statewide death toll to 545 and the confirmed cases total to 15,028. The New Mexico Department of Health said 111 of the additional cases were in Bernalillo County, the state’s largest county that includes the Albuquerque metro area. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. On Saturday, state authorities ordered a Walmart Supercenter in Las Cruces to close after four employees tested positive for the coronavirus in a three-week span. The store employs more than 400 people. The state Environment Department now is requiring the store to test all of its workers and thoroughly disinfect the building.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Certain nursing homes can allow visitors – with restrictions – starting Wednesday as the state eases a ban aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable elderly residents. Only nursing homes and long-term care facilities without any new coronavirus cases among residents and staffers in the past 28 days can allow limited visits, state Department of Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said. The department said the state’s policy follows federal guidance and is limited to nursing homes without staffing shortages that have tested all residents. Health department spokeswoman Jill Montag said about 150 of the more than 600 nursing homes in the state could qualify to open up to visitors. Roughly 500 nursing homes had reported COVID-19 cases among staffers in June, according to recently released data from the state, which doesn’t release data about the number of cases at individual nursing homes.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s witness requirement for people casting mail-in absentee ballots is unconstitutional during the COVID-19 pandemic, voters said Friday while suing to have it suspended during the emergency. State law says an absentee voter must fill out a traditional absentee ballot in the presence of two adults, who sign the sealed envelope confirming the voter’s identity. The law was amended last month for the rest of 2020 to reduce the number of witnesses to one. It’s based on the idea that older people and those at higher risk to contract the coronavirus are isolated in their homes. But even one witness is too many, according to four individuals who sued in Wake County Superior Court with help from the American Civil Liberties Union and a New York law firm. They said they have preexisting conditions that could otherwise force them to endanger their lives by seeking a witness.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDickinson: Metal band Great White has apologized for performing at an outdoor concert where the crowd didn’t wear masks despite the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. The band drew criticism on social media after the performance Thursday night as part of the “First on First: Dickinson Summer Nights” concert series in Dickinson, in the southwest of the state. Spin magazine posted video showing the crowd packed in and not wearing face masks. “We have had the luxury of hindsight and we would like to apologize to those who disagreed with our decision to fulfill our contractual agreement. The Promoter and staff were nothing but professional and assured us of the safety precautions,” Great White said in a statement Saturday. Although North Dakota health officials recommend social distancing and wearing masks when possible, there is no legal requirement to do so in the state, and Great White said the band nevertheless was “not in a position to enforce the laws.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: As infections have surged across the region, local public health officials have expanded their pandemic teams of contact tracers, with help from the state, and are running them seven days a week to track the coronavirus. In the city of Springdale, Health Commissioner Matt Clayton recruited Spanish speakers already known in the community to work as contact tracers. The Cincinnati Health Department brought aboard 10 employees of the Ohio Department of Health to supplement the 30 staffers and volunteers already contract tracing. Graduate students at Wright State University’s public health program are helping Warren County’s health department with contact tracing. Most citizens have understood the contact tracers’ task and have cooperated, the public health officials said last week, although about 10% to 15% of people have refused.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Monday reported 510 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and noted the state’s first death of a child from the disease. Officials at Fort Sill Army Post in southwest Oklahoma confirmed a 13-year-old dependent of a service member stationed there tested positive for COVID-19 and died Friday at Comanche County Memorial Hospital. “Our entire Lawton Fort Sill community is deeply saddened,” Maj Gen. Ken Kamper, commanding general of Fort Sill, said in a statement. The family members are currently in isolation at their home at Fort Sill, officials said. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported an additional two deaths Monday, bringing the statewide death toll to 424. The total number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in Oklahoma now stands at 20,745, although the actual number of cases is likely much higher since many people haven’t been tested, and some with the disease don’t show symptoms.\n\nOregon\n\nWoodburn: The city is suing Marion County over a COVID-19 isolation shelter at a Super 8 Hotel. The lawsuit was filed Thursday following a directive by the Woodburn City Council. Attorneys for the city seek a court order against Marion County to cease shelter operations. City officials maintain that the shelter is operating in violation of the Woodburn’s Zoning & Development Ordinance and say it poses a public safety risk to surrounding neighborhoods. The hotel is located across from a large facility with senior-restricted residences, a nursing home and a medical facility. Marion County officials said they would operate the shelter starting July 1 for nine months. As a condition of the county moving into phase 2 of reopening June 19, county health officials were required to find a facility for COVID-19 positive patients with mild symptoms who don’t have anywhere to isolate. The county chose the hotel in Woodburn – a coronavirus hot spot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A proposal to construct plastic barriers around school bus drivers as a COVID-19 mitigation tactic was shot down by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, a sign of one particular challenge – among many – schools face as they plan for a fall reopening. The state Education Department told districts last month each can restart in-person instruction with a plan that’s approved by the local school board, made public and provided to the state. But Education Secretary Pedro Rivera warned that transportation would be a difficult problem to solve. The great majority of the state’s public school districts contract with private companies to provide bus transportation, and those companies have difficulty finding and keeping enough drivers in the best of times, said Mike Berk with the Pennsylvania School Bus Association, a trade group.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Parking lots at every state beach in Rhode Island reached capacity Sunday as the temperature soared to 93 degrees, the state Department of Environmental Management reported. Capacity at the lots has been limited to ensure social distancing on the sand. Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Blood Center has put out a call for donors because even though the need for blood has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels as hospitals resume elective and non-critical surgeries, donor participation has not. About 50% of the region’s blood supply comes from mobile blood drives, but from March through June, most of those were canceled because of the pandemic. And even though blood drives have resumed, they are not being scheduled at pre-pandemic levels, blood center spokesperson Kara LeBlanc said in a statement. In addition, about one-fifth of the people who make appointments to donate blood do not show up.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A hospital system is suspending elective surgeries due to increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients that officials say are straining staff and other resources. Effective Tuesday, officials with Roper St. Francis in Charleston said procedures that aren’t time-sensitive would be put on hold across its four facilities to free up staff for an “unrelenting flood” of patients needing treatment for COVID-19. In all, 131 patients who had become ill after contracting the coronavirus were being treated at the hospital’s facilities, representing more than a third of all of Roper’s inpatient care. Emergency surgeries will still be performed as needed, hospital officials said. The decision comes amid a resurgence of confirmed cases across South Carolina, where state officials said there had been 56,485 total confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday afternoon. At least 950 people in South Carolina who contracted the virus have died.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state increased by 25 on Monday, and no new deaths were reported. South Dakota had a total of 7,524 COVID-19 cases as of Monday, according to the state health department. That doesn’t include people who show symptoms or are asymptomatic but are not tested. A total of 770 test results were reported Monday, and the positive rate for coronavirus tests was 3.2%. The death toll remained at 109. The state health department said 742 total people have been hospitalized during the pandemic, and 63 are currently hospitalized. The department has changed the time parameters for the data it provides every day. Data will now reflect information provided through 1 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. the previous day to allow staff to analyze the data during business hours instead of in the evenings, state epidemiologist Josh Clayton said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nearly 3,000 people have signed up to be poll workers during the coronavirus pandemic for the Aug. 6 primary, and many of the state’s counties still need more, officials said Monday. Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office said it’s not too late to apply, with signups available online. Early voting starts Friday and runs Mondays through Saturdays until Aug. 1. Hargett’s office began a poll worker recruitment campaign last month. Poll workers must be at least 16 or a registered voter if 18 or older. They cannot be a candidate or close relative of one and must be able to read and write in English. Poll workers must wear face coverings and will be trained on COVID-19 precautions, including social distancing. They will be provided personal protective equipment, including masks. Poll workers are paid for training, early voting and Election Day work. Additionally, they help count absentee votes.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Texas Supreme Court on Monday upheld Houston’s refusal to allow the state Republican convention to hold in-person events in the city due to the coronavirus pandemic. The court dismissed an appeal of a state district judge’s denial of a temporary restraining order sought by the state Republican Party. Shortly after the ruling, GOP leaders said they would call a meeting of the party’s executive committee to “finalize our path forward.” A separate court hearing was ongoing Monday in Harris County, where Houston is located, in which a different judge was hearing the party’s arguments to allow the convention to go forward. The state GOP convention had been scheduled to begin Thursday at Houston’s downtown convention center and was expected to draw thousands of participants. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, said last week that he had directed city lawyers to terminate the contract because he believed the event could not be held safely.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Prisons and jails have seen some of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19 in the U.S., and Washington County’s Purgatory Correctional Facility saw one of the nation’s fastest outbreaks in recent weeks when nearly a third of all inmates tested positive. At the peak of the outbreak, there were 96 inmate cases. Officials at the jail say they had a thorough plan in place, attributing the rapid spread to many inmates being asymptomatic and tough to diagnose before they spread it to others. Friends and family of the inmates haven’t been convinced. A large crowd gathered to share them during a vigil at the facility July 3 at which inmates’ family members spoke about how they feel the jail has not done enough to protect those on the inside from the virus. Then, on Friday, another group gathered in front of the Washington County Attorney’s office in protest of conditions at the jail.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state is suing the Department of Homeland Security to block a rule that would require foreign students to leave the country if their school only provides classes online this fall, the Attorney General’s Office said Monday. Vermont is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia that filed suit Monday, arguing the rule is cruel and unlawful. Last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified colleges that international students would have to leave the U.S. or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall. Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said the rule would be a huge loss to Vermont and its students. As of Friday, the University of Vermont had 566 active students from 67 countries who could be affected. UVM is currently planning to bring students back to campus for the fall semester with a combination of in-person and remote classes.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: With 90 cases of COVID-19 reported in the area since June 30, July is trending to be the worst month for new cases in Staunton, Waynesboro and Augusta County. Last month 131 new COVID cases were reported, not counting case numbers suppressed in ZIP codes where there were fewer than five total cases. July could hit 200 new cases before the month is out. Even if the trend slows down by half, July will still be the worst month so far for new cases. The good news: No new area deaths were reported during this time, according to data from the Virginia Department of Health. The bad news: multiple outbreaks in congregate settings in the Central Shenandoah Health District, which has now reported 11 outbreaks in non-nursing facility congregate settings. Also, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association’s statewide numbers show a sharp increase in hospitalizations in July after a slow but steady decrease for more than a month.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: An economic research study indicated border restrictions resulting from the coronavirus could reduce future cross-border shopping trips into the state by Canadians. The Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University released a report concerning money spent by Canadians in Whatcom County in northwest Washington, The Bellingham Herald reports. The border between Washington state and British Columbia has been restricted to essential travelers and commercial trade since March 21 because of the pandemic. The restrictions are scheduled to expire July 21, but experts believe some controls will be extended through the summer. Easing border restrictions may not prevent a long-term impact on Canadian shopping behavior in Whatcom County, the research report said. “Even after the restrictions are lifted, concerns about public health and safety could continue to inhibit Canadians from shopping in the U.S.,” the report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: The year 2020 started with a push for vocational education and hands-on learning, but this has been made difficult by COVID-19 threats and students forced into online education at home, The Intelligencer reports. More than 60% of students at Wheeling Park High School are involved in career-based training classes at the school, according to Stephanie Bugaj, director of career and technical education at WPHS. She said the district is looking to step up at-home opportunities for vocational students as their return to classrooms and school workshops may be further delayed this fall. “Teachers are communicating with students and trying to keep them engaged,” Bugaj said. “They can do a lot of skills at home. We’re trying to come up with things for them to do this fall.” There are online instructional classes for students in most vocational areas, and they can replicate what they see by working on projects at home, she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Dane County’s new mask mandate went into effect at 8 a.m. Monday, requiring all over the age of 5 to wear a face covering indoors in public settings. However, Madison and Dane County’s public health department asked residents not to call the police if someone is violating the new requirement, as health conditions or disabilities can make the task difficult. In a tweet, they asked the county not to judge others – and not to call 911. “You have a role too,” the department said in a Sunday blog post. “Your job is to wear your mask and stay six feet away from others. It’s not to ask someone why they aren’t wearing a mask or to intervene if they aren’t. Some people have disabilities or health conditions where wearing a mask is difficult or dangerous, and sometimes their disabilities and health conditions may not always be visible.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State corrections officials plan to test all inmates and employees for the coronavirus. Wyoming and Hawaii are the only states that haven’t reported cases of COVID-19 among their inmate populations. Corrections Department Director Bob Lampert said last week that he wants to confirm that’s indeed the case in Wyoming. The testing was to begin Monday at the Wyoming Honor Farm in Riverton, followed by the Women’s Center in Lusk, the Honor Camp in Newcastle, and the state maximum- and medium-security prisons in Rawlins and Torrington. Regular surveillance testing will continue after every inmate is tested by the end of August. Corrections officials say the tests aren’t optional, and inmates who refuse to be tested will need to quarantine for two weeks.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/07/01/coronavirus-covid-des-moines-iowa-concert-things-to-do-near-me-entertainment-live-music-crowds/7622497002/", "title": "As COVID fades, Des Moines concert venues see surge in artist ...", "text": "When the downtown Des Moines landmark Vaudeville Mews called it quits last October, it looked like it might be the first of several Des Moines performance venues that would succumb to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a bid for survival, Lefty's Live Music in the Drake neighborhood turned to a GoFundMe campaign and sacrificed part of its space to open a vaping emporium.

We continue to monitor returns.\"\n\n— Yvonne Wingett Sanchez\n\n12:50 a.m.: Trump declares early victory, despite many votes outstanding\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was sweeping most battleground states and was well on his way to victory during remarks early Wednesday at the White House.\n\nHowever, he sought to sow distrust in the vote-counting process in several key swing states, repeating many false claims about how elections work.\n\nHe said his team was gearing up for a big celebration after winning states like Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas when “it was all called off.” He said he hasn’t been declared a winner in many of those states though he is leading by a wide margin that Biden can’t overcome.\n\nEarly results show Trump is leading Biden in crucial swing states, but there are many votes left to count.\n\nTrump said he planned to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent states from counting outstanding ballots late into the night, which he called a “fraud.”\n\nHowever, in Arizona, where he is trailing Biden by several points, Trump said it was too soon to call the race. He said there were many votes left to count and that he shouldn't be discounted yet, contradicting his comments about other swing states with large number of outstanding votes where he has falsely claimed he had won.\n\nHe said it would’ ve been “nice” to win but that winning Arizona wasn’t necessary to getting elected to a second term.\n\n— Rachel Leingang and Paulina Pineda\n\n12:30 a.m.: Dem grassroots groups celebrate possibility of turning Arizona blue\n\nVotes were still being counted in Arizona when cheers erupted from community organizers in south Phoenix who declared they were turning the state blue.\n\nDown-ballot victories for Democratic candidates in the traditional Republican stronghold were celebrated as “vindication of all the pain and suffering we’ve seen in the community.”\n\nActivists from the Unite Here labor union, CASE Action social justice group and Living United for Change grassroots organization applauded voter drives that they said helped bring thousands of young voters to the polls in 2020.\n\nOrganizers outside the CASE Action offices on Seventh Avenue just before 11 p.m. said just “showing up” was a victory.\n\n“Never in my life did I think we would be up in the air here in Arizona,” said Marisela Mares, 22, referring to a presidential election that was too close to call. “It could be a very close race. We’re pushing that margin.”\n\nMares, who started organizing with Unite Here eight years ago at 14, said Arizona has evolved from a red state in 2010 to a purple state in 2018 to a blue one on Tuesday night. Organizers for years have made a determined effort to convince Hispanic and young voters that they could make a difference, Mares said.\n\n“I think it’s a lot more blue than we were, even just two years ago,” Mares said. “I don’t know what color is between blue and purple, but we are there.”\n\nUnite Here organizer Maria Hernandez said union members, primarily hospitality workers, many of whom have lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, blitzed the state since June, knocking on as many as 800,000 doors.\n\n“The fact that we got to this point in Arizona is no accident,” she said. “We are instilling hope where there was once fear.”\n\nTuesday’s results proved when the community comes together, it can speak with a powerful voice, said Stephanie Maldonado, campaign director for Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA.\n\n“We were told, ‘Latinos don’t show up.’ But Latinos showed up,” she said. “We showed up, we voted early and we trusted a system. It was 10 years in the making; 10 years to get to today, 10 years to ensure our voices, our families and our communities were represented.”\n\nMaldonado said the movement was led by people under 30. She said they were motivated by anger over SB 1070, Arizona’s notorious immigration measure passed in 2010, which targeted undocumented immigrants with some of the strictest laws in the country.\n\n“Young people showed up and represented in Arizona,” she said. “Why? Because 10 years ago, we couldn’t vote. Ten years ago, we saw our parents and our community impacted by SB 1070, and tonight young people showed up and we won.”\n\n— Robert Anglen\n\n11:45 p.m.: 2 people say they couldn't vote after being kicked out of vote center\n\nTwo siblings say they were among a small group of voters denied a vote and removed by law enforcement from a vote center in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday evening despite being in line by the 7 p.m. cutoff.\n\nIt was one of only a few allegations of voters being turned away from polling sites in Arizona as of Tuesday night, and the only one involving law enforcement.\n\nTimitria Thompson, 22, and her 24-year-old brother, Adrion Thompson, told The Republic that they were in line at 7 p.m. when they were asked to leave a polling place near Seventh and Southern avenues because it had closed.\n\nThe siblings said they insisted on being allowed to vote but that a man running the polling location kept trying to kick them out and eventually called police.\n\nAt least four Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to the scene and threatened to arrest Timitria Thompson on suspicion of trespassing and disorderly conduct, she said.\n\nAfter waiting in the polling place for more than an hour, Timitria Thompson said law enforcement eventually pushed her out.\n\nA Sheriff's Office spokesperson confirmed deputies were at the scene but said they \"did not take any law enforcement actions.\" A Phoenix Police Department spokesperson said the Sheriff's Office called Phoenix police to the scene but no arrests were made.\n\n— Chelsea Curtis\n\n11:20 p.m.: County Recorder Fontes says voting went without a hitch\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes told The Republic after polls closed Tuesday that voting went \"very, very well.\"\n\nA couple dozen locations had long lines after polls closed, but workers got them in and out quickly, he said.\n\nThroughout the day, very few voters had to wait more than 45 minutes.\n\nThere were a few snafus, he said, including some printers that ran out of ink. But those problems were addressed quickly.\n\n\"All in all, very positive feedback from the vast majority of voters that we had contact with,\" he said. \"I think this system worked very well.\"\n\nAbout 167,000 voters in Maricopa County cast ballots in person on Tuesday. That doesn't include people who dropped off signed and sealed ballots at the polls.\n\nThe county said it will continue to update election results throughout the night until all ballots cast in person on Tuesday are counted. Ballots that were dropped off will be verified and counted later in the week.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n11 p.m.: Joe Biden says he's 'confident about Arizona'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke to a car rally in Wilmington, Delaware, about 10:40 p.m. Arizona time on Tuesday, telling the crowd to be patient and expressing confidence that his campaign would prevail.\n\n“We're confident about Arizona. That's a turnaround,” Biden said.\n\nHe stressed the importance of counting all votes before declaring a winner.\n\n“We're gonna have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished, and it ain't over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted,” Biden said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump tweeted, without evidence, that he was winning big and that “they” were trying to “STEAL the Election.”\n\n“We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” he wrote.\n\n— Rachel Leingang\n\n10:45 p.m.: Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel admitted to hospital\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Allister Adel was taken to the hospital for a health emergency, Jennifer Liewer, the office’s spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nInformation on Adel’s condition is limited at this time and “the situation is fluid.”\n\n“We ask for the community's thoughts and prayers at this time,” Liewer said.\n\nEarlier this evening, Adel’s campaign told The Republic, the county attorney was waiting for the first round of results at home with her family.\n\nDemocratic challenger Julie Gunnigle leads Adel in early returns in the Maricopa County attorney's race.\n\nGunnigle wrote on Twitter that she wished Adel “a full recovery.” She found out about the health emergency online.\n\n“My thoughts are with Allister and her family,” she wrote.\n\n— Lauren Castle\n\n10 p.m.: Mark Kelly speaks in Tucson\n\nAt an event in Tucson, Democrat Mark Kelly told supporters he is confident that he will defeat incumbent U.S. Sen. Marth McSally when all of the votes are counted.\n\n\"We're going to be successful in this mission,\" he said.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\n9:45 p.m.: AZ Republicans, Democrats hold election night events\n\nNearly 200 members of the Arizona Republican Party gathered Tuesday night for an election result watch party, at least half decked out in Trump gear.\n\nThe invite-only event started at 7 p.m. in a courtyard near the intersection of Arizona Avenue and Boston Street in Chandler.\n\nState Treasurer Kimberly Yee opened the night.\n\n“So many of you have been a part of our movement of knocking on doors and getting people out there to vote, thank you,” Yee said.\n\nSupporter Denise Phillips praised the president’s work with the economy.\n\n“I went to his last rally in Goodyear,” Phillips said, “It is just amazing … I have never seen anyone draw that type of energy. He is such a rock star.”\n\nAlthough Phillips is extremely supportive of the president, she admitted to having doubts about him securing the presidency for a second term.\n\n“I knew in my heart in 2016 that he was going to win, but now I’m a little more worried,” Phillips said.\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Party leaders erupted with cheers at a watch party in Phoenix as initial county vote totals that dropped at 8 p.m. showed Democrats with sizable leads in key races.\n\nSome shouted, “Oh my god!” multiple times as they scrolled down the Maricopa County Recorder Office’s website, which showed Joe Biden and Mark Kelly leading the vote in the county while Democrats led in the county races for attorney, sheriff, recorder and assessor.\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes lauded the county’s high voter turnout.\n\n“Even though there might still be a couple people in line here — by the way, stay in line if you’re in line and vote — we created a system that makes it very, very easy,” Fontes said. “In fact, it is so easy to vote in Maricopa County, that we’ve got record numbers even during a global pandemic.”\n\nMaricopa County Democratic Chair Steven Slugocki said the state’s most populous county would transform the state from the Republican stronghold it once was.\n\n“Tonight, we made history in Maricopa County by turning this county blue,” Slugocki said. “Maricopa County is going to lead the way to Arizona turning blue. We are no longer a red state in Arizona.”\n\n— Katelyn Keenehan and Perry Vandell\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona returns 7 US House incumbents, per AP\n\nThe Associated Press has called seven Arizona U.S. House races for incumbents.\n\nIncumbent Democrats Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick and Greg Stanton and incumbent Republicans Paul Gosar, Debbie Lesko and Andy Biggs will return to Congress.\n\nThe two other congressional races are too close to call.\n\nIn early returns, incumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in District 1 U.S. House race and Democrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Rep. David Schweikert in District 6 U.S. House race.\n\n9 p.m.: Arizona voters legalize marijuana, according to AP\n\nArizona voters approved a ballot measure to legalize marijuana, according to the Associated Press.\n\nProposition 207 will legalize possession of as much as an ounce of marijuana for adults 21 and older and set up a licensing system for retail sales of the drug, starting with the medical-marijuana dispensaries already operating in the state. Sales will begin in March under the measure.\n\nThe measure also allows people previously convicted of marijuana crimes, such as the felony charge for possession, to have their records expunged by the courts.\n\nAnd it establishes special \"social equity\" licenses for communities historically disenfranchised by marijuana laws.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n9 p.m.: Democrats have slight lead in race for 3 seats on Arizona Corporation Commission\n\nDemocrats are ahead in the first returns of the six-way race for three seats on the Arizona Corporation Commission, which sets rates and policies for utilities in the state, including how much renewable energy they are required to use.\n\nEarly ballots counted and posted Tuesday in Arizona are thought to skew towards registered Democrats, with more Republicans showing up in person Tuesday to vote. While Democrats led, the margin between them and the Republicans was small.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n8 p.m.: Gallego, Ortega and Peterson lead in mayoral races\n\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego leads challengers Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay in early results.\n\nFormer council member David Ortega leads opponent Lisa Borowsky in the race for Scottsdale mayor, according to early election results.\n\nBrigette Peterson leads Matt Nielsen in the race for Gilbert mayor, according to early results.\n\n— Jen Fifield, Lorraine Longhi and Alison Steinbach\n\n8 p.m.: Julie Gunnigle leads Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race\n\nDemocrat challenger Julie Gunnigle leads County Attorney Allister Adel in early returns in Maricopa County attorney race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Paul Penzone leads Jerry Sheridan in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race\n\nIncumbent Democrat Paul Penzone leads Republican Jerry Sheridan, former deputy to Joe Arpaio, in early returns in Maricopa County sheriff’s race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Tipirneni leads Schweikert in House race\n\nDemocrat challenger Hiral Tipirneni leads Republican Rep. David Schweikert in early returns in U.S. House District 6 race.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: O’Halleran leads Shedd in House race\n\nIncumbent Tom O’Halleran leads Republican Tiffany Shedd in early returns in District 1 U.S. House race.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Education Prop. 208 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 208, which would raise taxes on the wealthy to fund education in Arizona, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Marijuana Prop. 207 ahead in early returns\n\nProposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, is ahead in early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Mark Kelly leads Martha McSally in early returns in Senate race\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly leads Republican Senator Martha McSally in early returns in the U.S. Senate race with national implications.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n8 p.m.: Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in Arizona early returns\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in Arizona early returns.\n\nThese results consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n7:45 p.m.: Some lines remain after polls closed\n\nAbout 100 voters remained in line at Mesa Community College after polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\nVoters in line before 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast votes as long as they stay in line.\n\nCampaign volunteers and poll observers who were stationed at the site said voters were told that a ballot printing machine went down for about an hour and a half around 4:30 p.m., which caused a major backup.\n\nRandy Perez, a volunteer with Arizona Center for Empowerment, said he notified the county as soon as he heard about the issues with the machine, but it still took over an hour to fix.\n\n\"They should have fixed the machine faster or informed voters of other options,\" Perez said.\n\nA Maricopa County Elections Department spokesperson said the ballot printer did not break, but was running slowly for about a half hour. She said the county deployed technicians who were able to get the machines running at a normal speed.\n\nAt 7 p.m., a poll worker called out the line to vote was closing. Sarai Soto, 34, walked up within a minute. The poll worker turned her away. A fight erupted between poll watchers, a man in line and the poll worker over the woman’s right to vote\n\nThe woman said that because of poor signage to direct voters to where to vote on the large campus she had spent 30 minutes looking for the polling place\n\n​She said she waited for about 20 minutes at another campus building with about four other voters also looking for the polling place\n\nShe said she’s Puerto Rican, and cares deeply about voting in this election.\n\n\"It was my first time voting. Now, I don’t get to vote,\" Soto said.\n\nThe line to vote at Surprise City Hall wrapped around the building and doubled back inside around 6:30 p.m. with more than 150 voters waiting to cast ballots. The line moved quickly, however, and there were only a few voters left waiting by 7:30 p.m.\n\nEdward Wagner, 58, a Republican with his two young daughters in tow, said his wait of more than an hour was worth it to vote for Trump and the GOP at all levels of office in “the biggest election of the century.”\n\nWagner criticized Democrats for disrespecting Trump, trying to block him at every turn and waging a “faulty impeachment” effort.\n\nSeeing violence rise in his hometown of Chicago and other cities led by Democrats turned him away from the party, he said.\n\nA former Peace Corps volunteer who met his wife in Africa, Wagner said he understands the problem of racial inequity but believes that Democrats haven’t succeeded in fixing it. He praised Trump for signing a prison reform bill and said he would support the president going further on the issue.\n\nAs a Catholic, Wagner said he opposes abortion and believes in a traditional view of family, which he said Trump has a good record on.\n\nWagner said his family takes pandemic precautions seriously and he mourns the more than 230,000 dead, but he said with medical treatments improving, the country can’t afford more economic closures.\n\nTrump’s strength has been impressive, Wagner said.\n\n“He is as tough as nails. Just look at how he recovered from COVID himself, holding four rallies a day. He’s worked really hard,” Wagner said.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez and Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n7:30 p.m.: 2 downtown Phoenix businesses boarded up in case of protests\n\nAnticipating protests following Election Day results, at least two businesses in downtown Phoenix have taken precautions to protect their buildings.\n\nSnooze A.M. Eatery near Central Avenue and McKinley Street was seen boarding up its windows on Tuesday afternoon. According to Chris Lee, a Fix It Services manager, Snooze called the handyman company to board up their downtown location due to \"alleged riots.\"\n\nThe Wells Fargo location in downtown Phoenix also mounted wood boards over their exterior windows.\n\n\"We're just kind of closely monitoring things out of an abundance of caution and for the safety of employees and customers,\" said LiAna Enriquez, a Wells Fargo spokesperson in Phoenix. \"We're aware of concerns of the possibility of post-election demonstrations.\"\n\nThe downtown location is the only one in Arizona that will board up its windows, Enriquez said, because it is close to the Capitol where numerous protests were held over the summer.\n\n\"As a precaution, we are boarding windows of a small number of branch locations in select cities. Any branches that have been boarded are operating normally, unless they were already temporarily closed due to COVID-19,\" Enriquez said in a statement.\n\nPhoenix City Hall, which has also been a popular meeting spot for protesters this year, was not boarded up as of Tuesday evening, Phoenix Public Works Department spokesperson Yvette G. Roeder confirmed.\n\n\"However, the Public Works Department is prepared with materials, should the need arise,\" she said.\n\nSeveral Arizona Department of Public Safety vehicles were seen in the parking lot of the Arizona House of Representatives on Tuesday evening, but spokesperson Bart Graves said troopers will be staffed at \"normal levels\" on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department Headquarters was surrounded by barricades as it has been since protests began in downtown Phoenix in May after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nMaggie Cox, a Phoenix police spokesperson, said as of Tuesday evening, the department has \"additional officers mobilized\" and has been working with federal, state and local law enforcement partners to \"ensure the safety of our community.\"\n\n\"While we have no information to indicate there will be criminal activity as a result of the election, we will continue to monitor activity related to demonstrations and responses will be determined by intelligence-driven information,\" Cox said. \"We also remind community members, 'If you see something, say something.'\"\n\n— Jamie Landers and Emily Wilder\n\n7 p.m.: Polls close in Arizona for anyone not already in line\n\nPolls have officially closed across Arizona. However, any voter who was in line at 7 p.m. will be allowed to cast a ballot.\n\nThe first batch of results are expected around 8 p.m. Those results will consist of early ballots counted in the past several days and weeks.\n\nSubsequent reports later in the evening will include ballots cast at polling places on Election Day.\n\nMail ballots dropped off on Election Day must go through the same signature matching and curing process as all the other mail ballots. These ballots may not appear in the results for a few days.\n\n— Jessica Boehm and Andrew Oxford\n\n6:45 p.m.: Hiral Tipirneni thanks voters before polls close\n\nA little over an hour before polls closed, as a line of voters snaked through the campus of Paradise Valley Community College, congressional candidate Hiral Tipirneni stopped for one of the campaign’s final visits.\n\n“Thank you for voting,” Tipirneni told voters as they streamed past, her voice a little muffled by a bright pink mask that said “VOTE” in sparkling silver.\n\nA boy who looked old enough to vote told her he wasn’t. “Well, hopefully you’re with somebody who’s voting,” Tipirneni told him. “And in a couple years, you’ll be here to vote.”\n\nTipirneni, who is challenging Rep. David Schweikert in a close race, did not draw much attention. She stood outside the 75-foot electioneering boundary, hands folded at her waist, and thanked voters as they walked to the back of the line.\n\nFew voters seemed to recognize the candidate. She turned to a group of campaign staffers behind her. “They’re like, who is this woman?” she said, referring to the people walking past. “And why is she all dressed up to come to the polls?”\n\nA few minutes later, one of her staff walked off, and returned with a crisp white campaign sign. The staffer jammed the sign into the roots of a tree, and they headed to the next polling place.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n6:35 p.m.: Trump voters energized in Tucson\n\nAn enthusiastic group of nearly 20 Republican voters gathered in the Tucson suburb of Casas Adobes on Tuesday afternoon to show their support for President Donald Trump with a few hours remaining before polls close in Arizona.\n\nMany of these supporters said they chose to vote earlier in the day in person at the polls, taking cues from Trump, who has cast doubts on the safety of the vote-by-mail process despite no evidence of voter fraud.\n\n“I’m not going to send my mail, the ballot for president of the United States. That is too severe and it’s too important. So I went to a polling place because I know that it’s more secure and it’s harder to be thrown out,” said Joseph Abeyta from Tucson.\n\nThe diverse group of supporters waved flags and signs, with cars honking in support or in opposition at the intersections of Oracle and Ina roads. The group gathered in front in the Safeway plaza where in 2011 a gunman shot and injured former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, whose husband, Mark Kelly is on the ballot as the Democratic Senate candidate.\n\nThis precinct is part of the Republican suburbs that ring the heavily Democratic city of Tucson, and had some of the highest vote totals in Pima County for Trump in 2016.\n\nMelissa Shaw showed up to the rally with her 11-year-old daughter Trista after casting her ballot in person. She said her daughter was top of mind when she voted for Trump.\n\n“I want a strong economy. I want her to go to college and work for something. I don’t want her to go to college and think, ‘Oh, all of my debt is gonna be paid off.' I want her to go to college and pay for it and earn it,” she said.\n\nPima County skews heavily Democrat. But in the last month of the campaign Trump and Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Tucson on multiple occasions to boost turnout among his supporters in hopes of offsetting his projected losses in southern Arizona.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\n6:30 p.m.: Youth excited to vote\n\nMohammed Mohammed, 23, of Tempe, voted for Joe Biden at Tempe Escalante Community Center.\n\nHe said he was driven to vote because he wanted to see racial justice and more education opportunities for young people.\n\n“The most important thing that matters for me is a president that’s going to help the students, help with education. Kind of solve the systemic problems that we have in America today,\" Mohammed said.\n\nMohammed is one of hundreds of thousands of young people across the country committed to making their voices heard this election.\n\n“All my friends are voting. The way that it was so crucial, especially for the year 2020, just made everyone vote,\" he said.\n\nMohammed said this election was the first time he took local elections seriously. He was eager to vote for Proposition 207, which would legalize recreational marijuana, because he believes Arizona will benefit from taxing marijuana.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez\n\n6 p.m.: U.S. Postal Service misses order to sweep facilities for ballots\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service failed to meet a judge’s order on Tuesday for a sweep of its mail processing facilities in a dozen districts across the United States, including Arizona, to search for undelivered absentee ballots.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the sweep on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the NAACP and other groups after the Postal Service said about 300,000 ballots had not been scanned as delivered.\n\nOther postal facilities singled out for inspection include some in central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Detroit, Colorado/Wyoming, Atlanta, Houston, Alabama, northern New England, greater South Carolina, South Florida and Lakeland.\n\nSullivan, who is based in Washington, D.C., ordered the sweep for early Tuesday afternoon but the Postal Service said in a response it was “unable to accelerate\" its ongoing daily review process to conduct the sweep \"without significantly disrupting preexisting activities on the day of the election.”\n\nThe Postal Service said it is already conducting daily reviews of 220 facilities across the country handling election mail.\n\nRod Spurgeon, a spokesperson for the Postal Service in Arizona, said: “We do not currently have any issues impacting the timely delivery of ballots but will continue to monitor and be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nSullivan wrote Tuesday that he would let the Postal Service’s ongoing process continue but added the agency “shall be prepared to discuss the apparent lack of compliance with the court's order” during a hearing on Wednesday.\n\n— Andrew Oxford\n\n5:30 p.m.: Disparate views in Glendale\n\nPeople streamed steadily into the polling place at Glendale Community College in the mid-afternoon, but lines to vote in person were only a few minutes long, voters reported.\n\nFernando Cazares said equality for immigrants and LGBTQ people were key factors driving his vote for Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough he respects Trump voters, he said he generally disagrees with Trump's policies.\n\n“I want for everybody to be treated the same,” Cazares said.\n\nCazares, a 19-year-old caregiver, said it was his first time voting. He went to the Glendale Community College polling place on his day off with a friend to cheer him on who is an immigrant and could not vote.\n\n“This election is going to be one for the history books,” Cazares said. “It feels good. People went through a lot just to be able to vote. Being able to vote in itself is a privilege.”\n\nWearing a camouflage Army hat and standing in the shade as the afternoon temperature hit 90 degrees, Calvin Hamilton said he was proud to vote for a second time for Trump.\n\n“I wasn’t one of those silent voters,” Hamilton, 75, said. “I’m a Trumper.”\n\nThe military veteran said he likes Trump’s cuts to government and regulations.\n\n“He kept his word. When’s the last time you could say that about a president?” Hamilton said.\n\nThe election is “paramount to the future,” Hamilton said. “We have more government than we need.”\n\nRyker Martin, 28, a Glendale resident aiming to become a teacher, said he had become disillusioned with the political process after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so he cast a protest vote for president in 2020, writing in the \"Star Trek\" character Jean-Luc Picard.\n\n“I think the left-right dichotomy is built out of fear,” Martin said. “It’s the same thing every time. … I’m tired of the same old, same old. I don’t see the point of voting for any party.”\n\nMartin said he voted in favor of state propositions to legalize marijuana and to raise taxes on high-income earners to fund education, even though he worries some of the revenue raised for education will get wasted.\n\n“I’ve been in situations when I was in high school where we couldn’t even pay for paper, but we had people with six-figure salaries overloading the administration,” he said. “But the schools do need money, and if it’s going to keep them afloat until we can fix something about it, it’s the best I can do.”\n\n— Rebekah L. Sanders\n\n5:15 p.m. Some vote centers busy while neighboring locations quiet\n\nSome vote centers have seen long lines throughout the day, but locations just a few miles away from those sites have had no lines at all.\n\nVoters can check wait times and lines at locations.maricopa.vote.\n\nSurprise City Hall saw waits of 30 minutes or more throughout the afternoon. At about 5:20 p.m., the wait was about 51 minutes and there were more than 200 people in line. But just 2.4 miles away, R.H. Johnson Recreation Center in Sun City West reported no wait.\n\nMini Social, a location in downtown Scottsdale, also saw lines throughout the day. As of about 5:15 p.m., the wait was about 22 minutes and there were 69 people in line. Just 3 miles from there, Scottsdale Plaza Shopping Center saw a wait time of two minutes, with 10 people in line.\n\nAt the main voting location in Tolleson, Esther Angulo Community Center, the time to vote about 4:30 p.m. was about 38 minutes, with 122 people in line. About 2 miles away at Rio Vista School in Avondale, the wait was 2 minutes and there were 5 people in line.\n\n— Jen Fifield\n\n5 p.m.: Queen Creek voters allege voter harassment\n\nVoters at a Queen Creek vote center reported being harassed shortly before 1 p.m. by people who honked horns at them, yelled at them and tried to take their photographs.\n\nThe incident, which took place at a higher education complex called Communiversity, was reported to the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office as well as to the Election Protection hotline run by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\n“One of our field volunteers reported this issue and had the voter call into the hotline,” Election Protection spokesperson Ian Weiner said via email Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“We received this complaint and were able to mobilize our coalition to address and ultimately resolve the issue. We sent a team of trained de-escalators (called “Election Defenders”) and raised it to the Secretary of State who also alerted the county to get the matter resolved,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Maricopa County Recorder’s office said she heard that individuals had yelled at voters, but that if it occurred outside the 75-foot limit surrounding polling places it was not illegal.\n\nShe added that anyone outside the 75-foot limit was also allowed to photograph anyone going into or out of a polling place.\n\nShe said the office also received reports that people were telling voters outside the polling place that they should use ballpoint pens on their ballots instead of the Sharpie pens provided in the voting booths.\n\nVoters can use ballpoint pen in black or blue ink or a Sharpie, and vote centers use fine-tip Sharpies as they have the fastest drying ink. If ballpoint ink is not allowed to dry completely, it can smudge off onto the optical readers and spoil other ballots, according to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office.\n\nA plainclothes Maricopa County Sheriff's deputy was sent to investigate and found that a woman was handing voters ballpoint pens with a flyer urging them to not use sharpies. The woman was told to stop and agreed to leave. The spokeswoman said new optical reading equipment was brought to the site to ensure ballots were read correctly.\n\n— John D'Anna\n\n4:45 p.m.: Growing line in west Phoenix\n\nA line of about 40 people formed outside a west Phoenix vote center at Pendergast Early Learning Center in the afternoon.\n\nArizona State University criminal justice major Mario Torres, 21, was able to leave his shift at Amazon early to vote on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the company allowed employees three hours off to cast their ballots on Election Day.\n\nTorres said he felt that the presidential race was the most consequential on the ballot because, \"I don’t think who's in office right now is beneficial to our country.”\n\nHe said he's most concerned about racial injustice, environmental issues and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he's hopeful a new president will create change in those areas — even if it takes a while.\n\n\"Change probably takes a long time to happen, as we’ve seen. But having someone who is more humanistic will help our society,\" Torres said.\n\n— José-Ignacio Castañeda\n\n4:30 p.m.: Advocacy group alleges voter suppression\n\nMembers of the organization Mi Familia Vota reported that they have received complaints from Spanish-speaking voters across the country about threatening calls and false information intended to confuse and discourage them from voting.\n\n\"The reports we have received are about intimidation and false information that are causing confusion in our voters,\" said Eduardo Sáinz, state director of Mi Familia Vota in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our message is clear: We have until today at 7 p.m. to participate in Arizona and we want our community to come out and vote to see the change we are waiting for,\" he said.\n\nSáinz did not present evidence, but said the reports come from reliable sources in the community.\n\nHe said that there is a helpline in Spanish that is 888-VE-Y-VOTA for people to call and report any false information or threats received regarding the elections.\n\nMi Familia Vota is a national civic engagement organization that advocates for social and economic issues that affect the Latino community, from immigration to worker rights.\n\n— Javier Arce\n\n4:15 p.m.: Active voters in central Phoenix\n\nThe first time she was eligible to vote, Pricilla Galaviz let the election pass by.\n\nNot this time. The 22-year-old stopped by the Phoenix Union High School District Office vote center on her way to the gym to cast her first ballot, thinking the entire time of friends and family who didn’t have that option.\n\nShe wanted to represent her Latino community, like her friends with DACA status and her father, who’s a resident but not a citizen. Somebody needed to speak for them. Galaviz, who works as a medical assistant at a surgery center, believed her vote could help.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said. “I’m voting for them. For the people who can’t.”\n\nAsked to pick her most important vote, Galaviz said she couldn’t choose. She’d researched them all. The opportunity to vote at all felt “amazing,” she said.\n\n“It’s just more personal to me this year,” she said.\n\nRuth Steen, a Phoenix elementary school teacher, spends her days around young people, and she wanted them to see that voting is important.\n\n“If they could watch me go in and do it, maybe other people would walk in,” she said after casting a ballot in central Phoenix. “Maybe if I see more people actually going in, somebody will stop and go, ‘Oh, I should go vote.’”\n\nEspecially this year. Steen said she was particularly motivated to vote against President Trump — \"I don’t like his character\" — and for Proposition 207, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona.\n\nSteen said she’d done her research, and saw a benefit in the taxes that legalization would raise. “I heard the states that have done it have done very well, as far as getting money to go back to them,” she said.\n\n— Alden Woods\n\n3:45 p.m.: Mixed turnout in northern Arizona\n\nThe sun finally broke through thunderstorm clouds around 3 p.m. outside a voting location at Flagstaff Mall, where a handful of people lined up to vote.\n\nIt was a quiet affair, people meandering in and out of the poll with their young children, on their way to class at nearby Northern Arizona University or as they headed into the mall.\n\nIn the parking lot, a car emblazoned with pro-Biden bumper stickers and painted “Every Vote Matters!” sat only a few spaces from a truck flying a \"Thin Blue Line\" flag. Eventually they both pulled away, their drivers returning from inside each wearing “I Voted!” stickers.\n\nEarlier in the day, about 40 people lined up in light rain outside a polling place at the Camp Verde Community Library. Thunder rumbled overhead, but most appeared to be in good spirits.\n\nAlana Lewis, 18, was excited to participate in her first election.\n\n“It’s time for a change,” she said, then shrugged. “It’s just a lot of chaos that happened this year and I’ve seen a lot of the president’s true side of who he is and how he runs things.”\n\nStill in high school, she became politically aware with the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, which began in 2016. As a Native American, she said witnessing Trump’s response to the peaceful demonstrations there was eye-opening.\n\n“It’s kind of discriminating. Why do people have to fight for human rights, you know?” she asked.\n\nWhile not their first election, this was the first time Susan and Jerry Bennett came to vote in person. They came because they wanted to participate directly in this historic moment.\n\nThe two retirees came to vote for “democracy, capitalism, not socialism,” they said.\n\nSeveral paces behind, Ron Bennett (unrelated) was less enthused about his choices. He asked with a laugh, “What are the lesser of two evils?”\n\nSeveral people in line around him laughed and nodded in lighthearted disillusionment.\n\n— Emily Wilder\n\n3:15 p.m.: 18 ballots stolen but returned to voters\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office announced that it believes 18 ballots were stolen out of individual mailboxes in Glendale late last week.\n\nIn a statement, the office said a resident found the ballots hidden under a rock near 99th and Glendale avenues and contacted the Glendale Police Department on Friday.\n\nThe Glendale Police Department shared a video of Brayan Ruiz, who said he found the ballots under concrete and rocks while at work at Rovey Farms. He kicked the rocks, saw they said something about elections, took a picture and sent it to his boss, who told him to bring them to the office and then they contacted Glendale police.\n\n\"I really have no information of who could have put them there, or how they got there. All I know is they were there and I took action and returned them to Glendale police,\" Ruiz said.\n\nInvestigators believe the mail-in ballots were stolen from individual mailboxes in a neighborhood just south of 107th and Northern avenues. The envelopes were still sealed.\n\nAttorney General's Office agents and Glendale police officers hand-delivered the ballots back to the registered voters over the weekend.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office said the motive for stealing the ballots is unclear. An investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made.\n\nAnyone with information regarding the incident can submit tips to the Attorney General’s Election Integrity Unit online or email EIU@azag.gov.\n\nVoters can check the status of their ballots on the Arizona Secretary of State’s website.\n\n— Jessica Boehm\n\n3 p.m.: 'A lemonade stand for democracy' in south Phoenix\n\nVolunteers from United Farm Workers — some coming from other states in the West to focus on swing-state Arizona — have been hitting the pavement for months reaching voters in south Phoenix.\n\nOn Tuesday, the culmination of their efforts is a voter information booth at El Reposo Park, the site of the \"Low Ridin' for Biden\" event on Sunday, one of the organization’s last hurrahs to mobilize voters.\n\nOrganizers prepared a single table with treats and water in a cozy south Phoenix neighborhood between Seventh Street and Central Avenue.\n\n“I would say, if anything, it’s a lemonade stand for democracy,” Elizabeth Strater, a UFW volunteer from California, said of the humble table. “Because this is a community that doesn’t feel represented, these are folks that may not know where they’re supposed to vote.”\n\nSo far, a little more than 35 people showed up to ask for information.\n\nCommunities like south Phoenix, which is home to some of the poorest neighborhoods in Phoenix and has the highest Black and Latino populations in the city, are often disproportionately affected by voter disenfranchisement. Often, the community is skeptical of candidates and information just doesn’t reach voters.\n\n“The majority of people do want to be engaged, they just don’t have the tools to be engaged,” said Ernie Flores, a UFW volunteer from Yuma. “There’s no perfect representation, as Cesar Chavez said. There’s no perfect democracy, but there is perfect participation.”\n\nHe said it seems possible that Arizona will turn blue because of its Latino population, if not now, then in the future. He said Trump’s message to Latinos was that he was against them right off the bat, and that encouraged Latino voters to vote against him.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n2:30 p.m.: Maricopa County approaches 100,000 voters\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said voter turnout in the county is in line with what officials expected, with about 99,000 voters casting ballots in person before 1:30 p.m.\n\nThat doesn't include other voters who dropped off their mail-in ballots at the polls.\n\nJordy and Alexis Berrelleza did just that.\n\nThe Phoenix siblings said they wanted to cast their first votes together. After their ballots arrived in the mail, Jordy, 19, walked his sister through the choices, explaining the options as simply as he could.\n\n“In a non-biased way,” he said, grinning under his black mask, but the siblings voted mostly the same way anyway.\n\nBefore Election Day, they thought about mailing in their ballots, but all the noise surrounding the integrity of the election changed their minds.\n\n“We felt like it was more secure to bring it in person,” Jordy said. So together they headed to the offices of the Phoenix Union High School District, where there was a steady stream of voters but no line.\n\nIn the end, Jordy said, they probably didn’t have any reason to worry.\n\n“It would’ve been the same,” he said of mailing in their votes, “because we just dropped it in a box.\"\n\n— Alden Woods and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\n2 p.m.: Navajo voters cast ballots\n\nNavajo voters streamed into the Steamboat Chapter House in Steamboat, Arizona, to cast their votes in Apache county.\n\nSeveral election officials paced the grounds, instructing voters which line to stand in. There was a line to vote in Apache County for the national and state election, and a line for local Navajo Nation government elections.\n\nThe voting line for the county moved quickly and the local voting line had build up as more and more people turned out to vote.\n\nElection officials made sure people in line maintained social distancing, kept face masks on and knew about hand-washing stations. They also checked temperatures before voters entered the building.\n\nAndrew Simpson and his wife Bessie Yellowhair-Simpson, from Steamboat in northeastern Arizona, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for family members to arrive from Phoenix. They both voted early by mail, but as community leaders — Andrew is a former council delegate and Bessi is the chapter treasurer — they stick around every Election Day.\n\nBessie, who is up for reelection, said she is use to seeing food stands lined up against the fence to feed voters before they head into the polls, but they couldn’t do that this year. The Navajo Nation Board of Elections sent out a memo before Election Day advising against food stands or political tents due to the pandemic.\n\n“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” he said, and he’s been able to recognize most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”\n\nAndrew feels that both major political parties haven’t spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed that they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.\n\n“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,\" he said. He hopes in a few years it will only get better.\n\n“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Andrew said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”\n\n— Shondiin Silversmith\n\n1:30 p.m.: Advocates say Native American voters see problems at polling sites\n\nVolunteers say they've heard of issues at polling locations in Apache County.\n\nVolunteers with Native Vote said they’ve received reports from Native American voters witnessing problems at polling sites. Patty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights and trains volunteers to monitor polling sites for problems.\n\nShe said they’ve received reports that polling sites in Apache County, including in Chinle and Window Rock, did not open on time this morning. That means some voters may have had to wait or leave if they had to work.\n\nFerguson Bohnee urged voters who experience or witness violations of voting rights to contact the Native Vote hotline at 888-777-3831 so attorneys can document and investigate the complaints.\n\nFurther south, three members of the Arizona State University's Indigenous pageant royalty supported the Native Vote at Bapchule, a community in the Gila River Indian Community.\n\nMiss Indigenous ASU Lourdes Pereira is a member of the federally recognized Hia-Ced O'odham but is enrolled at Tohono O'odham Nation. Pereira, a double major in American Indian and justice studies, said that one issue important to her is ensuring Native people can access ballots and return them from remote tribal communities while avoiding COVID-19 exposure.\n\nThe tribe instituted drive-thru voting, which First Attendant Jolene Fernandez said was a boon for elders, because it kept them from close contact with poll workers.\n\nThe tribe was also conducting its own election for council and an initiative to change the tribal constitution in regards to tribal membership.\n\n— Dianna M. Náñez, Debra Utacia Krol\n\n12:45 p.m.: Lines still long in Scottsdale, issues in Tucson\n\nLines in Old Town Scottsdale started growing shortly after the polling place at the Old Town venue Mini Social opened for voting Tuesday morning.\n\nBy the afternoon, the Maricopa County Recorder's Office website showed there were still dozens of people in line and wait times stretched upward of 20 minutes.\n\nLines at polling places across the Valley have moved smoothly throughout the late morning and early afternoon. Dozens of locations listed on the county recorder's website showed wait times between zero and 10 minutes.\n\nVolunteers say the police were called in Tucson on a man trying to influence voters to reelect President Donald Trump outside the Miller-Golf Links Library.\n\nRoger Dean, a registered Democrat, has been outside of the polling site since 7 a.m. with a sign that reads \"Democrats for Trump.\"\n\n“Two police officers showed up,” Dean said. “They had complaints of me standing here (intimidating) people.”\n\nHe added that he is allowed to be at the polling site as long as he is at the 75 feet marker.\n\nLeo Kresch, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Tucson, said she has also been at this polling location all day, and was there when the police were called.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Joshua Bowling\n\nNoon: Volunteers offer resources ahead of potential lunch rush\n\nVolunteers stood outside Valley polling places Tuesday morning as they waited for a potential surge of voters during the lunch hour.\n\nPromise Arizona was on-site at Mountain Park Health Center encouraging people to get out the vote. Some arrived in a white pickup adorned with red and blue streamers, American flags and \"Vote!\" written along the door.\n\nVolunteers and employees held banners in English and Spanish with the messages \"Vote today\" and \"Sí se puede.\"\n\n\"We are making sure voters are supported when they come cast their vote and if we see anything suspicious or anything that’s out of place we will help them and provide guidance,\" Manuel Gutierrez with Promise Arizona said.\n\nIn northwest Phoenix near 35th and Northern avenues, dozens of members of Unite Here Local 11, a labor union that represents 33,000 hotel and food service workers in southern California and Arizona, fanned out into the neighborhoods for one final day of knocking on doors.\n\n\"This is the day we are going to turn Arizona blue,\" Alex Sandoval, a Unite Here organizer and campaign field director, told the group before sending them out into the field.\n\nVoting-rights advocates said that in an election with historic turnout, voters who don’t speak English or experience other barriers to voting may struggle to reach help when they believe their rights are being violated. Chris Gilfillan, a director with the Arizona Center for Empowerment and Living United for Change in Arizona, was working with voter protection groups providing support in Spanish and other languages.\n\n\"Anyone can help reporting voting flags (problems) using the incident reporting form,\" he said.\n\nPatty Ferguson Bohnee leads Native Vote Arizona, an organization that protects against violations of Native American's voting rights. She urged people who experience or witness problems for Native American voters to call the Native Vote hotline or reach out to volunteers at polling sites.\n\nArizona political parties have provided hotlines to assist voters who only feel comfortable seeking help for potential violations from someone with their party of preference.\n\nVoter-assistance hotlines:\n\nNALEO ¡Ve y Vota!

Náñez, Megan Taros, Daniel Gonzalez\n\n11:30 a.m.: Religious polling places in the East Valley\n\nThe Islamic Center of the Northeast Valley in Scottsdale was one of two mosques serving as a polling location in Maricopa County this year. Around 40 people formed a line outside the mosque early in the day, but the line started moving quickly.\n\nVoter Cat Splete said it took her about a minute total to drop off her ballot. This is Splete’s first time voting in a presidential election. Climate justice is the key issue that moved her to vote, she said.\n\n“It goes into the environmental humanities — those who live in minority communities are always going to bear the brunt of those negative environmental factors,\" she said.\n\nMany voters at the center were not Muslim. That's because Muslims were encouraged to vote early this year, according to Ahmed Soussi, the interim director for the Council of American-Islamic Relation’s Arizona chapter.\n\nCAIR is a part of the One Arizona, a coalition that mobilizes and educates voters from marginalized communities. One Arizona said on Twitter they registered about 185,000 voters this year.\n\nThe Sun Lakes United Methodist Church in Chandler did not see large crowds Tuesday morning.\n\nTwo woman, who dubbed themselves “The Two Phyllises”, have spent the morning handing out fliers that they made for Republicans to help them narrow down their votes.\n\nPhyllis Lester, who already submitted her early ballot, said she came up with the idea for the fliers when she and her husband realized how many judges there were to choose from on their ballot this election.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy, Kelly Donohue\n\n11 a.m.: Complaint of man in Trump mask yelling at voters\n\nThere was a complaint Tuesday morning of a man yelling at Scottsdale voters.\n\nJohn Ainlay, a prescient committee member for Legislative District 23, said a man in a Trump mask yelled at voters as they went to cast their ballots around 9 a.m. at Florence Ely Nelson Desert Park in north Scottsdale.\n\nThe man allegedly yelled things like \"baby killers\" and \"stop stealing my taxes.\" Ainlay said a woman from the Arizona Republican Party threatened to call the police on the man if he continued. He quieted down but remained at the voting site, Ainlay said.\n\nNonpartisan volunteers at the site said they were not able to remove him because he was outside the allowed 75 foot boundary, but they expressed concern over his presence and attempts to intimidate voters.\n\n— Farah Eltohamy\n\n10:30 a.m.: Smooth voting in Tucson, Cordes Lakes\n\nEstevan Puentes, a 39-year-old south Tucson resident, came out to vote with his family Tuesday morning.\n\nHis mother only speaks and reads in Spanish. That can be a problem when polling sites do not have any Spanish speakers or ballots that she can understand, Puentes said.\n\nHe brought his son and nephew who are first-time voters, as well as his sister to make sure his family’s votes were counted this election. They were able to get in and out quickly as there was no sizable line at the polling place.\n\nIn Cordes Lakes, a turn off Interstate 17 on the drive to northern Arizona, voters weren't blocked by long lines either.\n\nThe Cordes Lakes Community Center had a short line, people were mostly masked and many donned pro-Trump paraphernalia. A steady flow of cars ambled in and out of the gravel parking lot. Tranquil and quiet under expansive clouded skies, it was hard to believe people were there to cast their votes in the explosive 2020 presidential election.\n\nAround 9:45 a.m., it began to rain, but people still stood dutifully outside.\n\nRandy Rogers and Angie McFadin emerged from their white truck. Issues about the border and health care brought both to the polls near their home.\n\n“I don’t like our two candidates, I’ll say that. I’m not a fan of either one of them,” Rogers said, walking toward the line stretching from the doorway of the one-story community center. “I was a Trump supporter last time because I liked what he had to say, and I’m definitely not a Democrat. Republicans want to take everything and Democrats want to give everything away.”\n\nUnlike 2016, he said he isn’t voting for Trump in this election. For the first time in his life, he’s casting his vote for the third-party candidate on the ballot, Jo Jorgensen.\n\nThe change was largely due to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger said. The infection had swept through his sister-in-law’s entire family.\n\n“For me, I can’t vote for these two guys with a clear conscience,” he aid.\n\n— Raphael Romero Ruiz, Emily Wilder\n\n10:15 a.m.: Rain in Gilbert, lines in Scottsdale\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had to close its doors and people made a dash for the dry interiors of their cars as rain came down in Gilbert.\n\nRecent ASU graduate Cameryn Baum stood outside of the Higley Road polling station with her cello this morning. She hoped to inspire more people to head inside and vote.\n\nBaum said she is participating in the nationwide Play for the Vote campaign, which is organizing musical performances throughout the country during Election Day to provide a positive incentive for people to head to the polls.\n\nIn Old Town Scottsdale, lines were long.\n\nEarlier in the morning, more than 100 people waited in line to vote outside Mini Social, a multi-use events venue in Old Town Scottsdale.\n\nThe line of voters curved and winded around the store fronts of Fifth Avenue. Some people walking up to vote expressed sighs of frustration.\n\nScottsdale City Council candidate Betty Janik was making her way steadily through the line at 8 a.m., talking to voters about issues and answering their remaining questions about the candidates.\n\nBy 9 a.m. a volunteer had come outside to tell voters that there were several polling locations within four to six miles of Mini Social that had no wait times.\n\nMinutes later, there were roughly 80 people in line with a wait time of 20 minutes.\n\n— Kelly Donohue, Lorraine Longhi\n\n9:45 a.m.: 'Hope that people are going to come together'\n\nVoters were largely optimistic at the Southern Plaza voting center in south Phoenix.\n\nMany emphasized the importance of the vote particularly in this tense and chaotic year, especially as Arizona stands on the precipice of historic change.\n\n“If anything if Arizona stays Trump but then turns blue it’s going to be an interesting time in the country,” said voter Sentari Minor as he left the polling center.\n\nThe atmosphere was friendly as political opponents and compatriots appealed to voters outside the center. Mia Hill, another voter at the center, said that despite tension leading in to the election that the outcome must be a call to unity.\n\n\"It was important to me that I bought and contribute to a positive future,\" Hill said. \"The fear of negative things happening, I think that’s all it is, is fear. I have hope that people are going to come together more than everything.\"\n\nJesus Olvera has children in school in south Phoenix. For him, the school board race was most important for his children’s future — but all the votes he cast were laying a foundation for them, he said.\n\nHe and other voters agreed the climate is ripe for change.\n\n\"I think there’s going to be a big change. I don’t know if it’s going to bring the results but it’s going to be a good time for us,\" Olvera said.\n\n— Megan Taros\n\n9:30 a.m.: Rep. Debbie Lesko alleges 'bias' at polling location\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko tweeted on Tuesday morning that a county poll worker in Sun City moved polling lines without measuring them and told Lesko she had to leave.\n\nLesko tweeted that she was at Radiant Church Sun City, near 107th Avenue and Boswell Bouelvard, when this happened.\n\n\"This is what's typical of some people that are biased,\" Lesko said in the video. \"And it's wrong.\"\n\nMegan Gilbertson, a spokesperson for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said workers at the site mistakenly thought it was a non-electioneering site. In Arizona, people aren't allowed to campaign or solicit votes within 75 feet of the polling place.\n\nThe location used to be one, but this year is not, Gilbertson said. The department addressed the mistake with the workers and Lesko, she said.\n\n— Joshua Bowling\n\n9:15 a.m.: First-time voters in the Ak-Chin Indian Community\n\nAk-Chin Indian Community had a quiet morning as people prepared for the day.\n\nBut at the tribe's community service center, slow but steady numbers of vehicles pull in as tribal members and community residents of the tribe exercise their right to vote.\n\nSamantha Alejandro is married to an Ak-Chin tribal member. The mother of three arrived early to cast her vote. She said she is concerned with how fast the racial climate has changed. The first-time voter said she voted for Biden and Harris.\n\n\"I'm for peace,\" she said. \"And we need to take steps to get there.\"\n\nAnother first-time voter had a different take.\n\n\"The way the president has handled the pandemic has been a disaster,\" said Jose Batopis III, 28.\n\nBatopis, who's enrolled in the Yavapai-Apache Nation and also has Yaqui and Tohono O'odham heritage, lives in Ak-Chin and has lost an uncle, great-uncle and his grandfather to the coronavirus. He, too, voted for the Biden-Harris ticket. \"They will take the country in a better direction,\" Batopis said.\n\nFormer tribal chairman and Elder Terry Enos has heard many candidate's promises for Indian Country.\n\n\"The president said he do a lot of things and did a 180 instead,\" Enos said. \"Trump just doesn't get it.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Enos said that Biden walks softly but carries a big stick. He's not sure what will happen after the long count but still will urge his kids to come cast their vote.\n\nVolunteers for Native Vote, a nationwide initiative that supports voting and deals with voting issues, were on hand for any problems. Anna Marie Smith and Annalise Parady came armed with brochures, information on the Native Vote Hotline for any problems and lots of water and snacks for the day.\n\n— Debra Utacia Krol\n\n9 a.m.: Mayoral races in Phoenix, Scottsdale and Gilbert\n\nPhoenix's three-way race between incumbent Kate Gallego, Merissa Hamilton and Tim Seay is a primary election, meaning a candidate must get more than 50% of the vote to win outright on Tuesday. Otherwise, the race goes to a runoff between the top two vote-getters in March.\n\nBoth Scottsdale and Gilbert follow the more traditional election cycle in which the primary was held in August. Tuesday's runoff mayoral races feature Lisa Borowsky and David Ortega in Scottsdale and Matt Nielsen and Brigette Peterson in Gilbert.\n\nBoth Phoenix and Scottsdale have council races on the ballot, too.\n\nThe Scottsdale runoff features six candidates for three seats.\n\nThe Phoenix primary has contested races in the four council districts on the ballot. The most crowded race is in District 7, where five candidates vie to replace term-limited Michael Nowakowski representing parts of south, west and downtown Phoenix.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Lines dwindle in Gilbert, West Valley\n\nAs lines at the Southeast Regional Library in Gilbert shortened after a busy morning, voters were able to get in and out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Higley Road.\n\nVeronica Parrillo, a first time nonpartisan volunteer, sat outside the polling place all morning to answer general questions that voters may have.\n\nShe said that the line had been moving pretty steadily.\n\n\"The longest I saw the line get was just over 20 minutes,\" Parillo said, adding that she expects more of a rush around lunchtime and later in the evening.\n\nIn Sun City West, lines had been virtually nonexistent since just after 6 a.m. Voters came by steadily but didn't have to wait in line.\n\nCarolyn Gelazela volunteered to watch the polling location at the R.H. Johnson Recreation Center. Before she left her home Tuesday morning, her daughter reminded her to take her vitamins and told her not to be afraid of COVID-19.\n\nThe recreation center requires voters inside to wear a face covering. Most voters who came by Tuesday morning wore a face mask or other covering.\n\n\"I'm not a big believer in this whole pandemic thing.

It has been updated with news of “CODA’s” Oscar wins. The film is streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn Siân Heder’s Oscar-winning coming-of-age film “CODA,” the Rossi family living room is a place the foursome gathers for big conversations – from the difficult and awkward to the celebratory.\n\nThe cozy sea-green space is where teenage Ruby, the sole hearing member of a deaf family, chides her parents for engaging in cacophonous intercourse while a crush is visiting. (Her position in the family gives the film its title – it’s the acronym for “child of deaf adults.”) It’s where the family argues over the fate of their fishing business. And at the film’s end, it’s where Ruby and her eager family gather to learn whether she’s been accepted into music school.\n\nWhen Alexandria Wailes and Anne Tomasetti, the film’s directors of Artistic Sign Language (that is, deaf experts of American Sign Language who choreograph signing for screen and stage performances), and actress Marlee Matlin walked on set to shoot those scenes, they immediately started rearranging the room’s furniture, Heder remembered.\n\nHeder, the film’s director and screenwriter, said she and her production set designer initially placed the furniture “where it seemed to fit” in the characters’ coastal Massachusetts home, “kind of ignoring the fact that this was a deaf family.”\n\nTroy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin are two of the deaf stars of \"CODA.\" Apple TV+\n\nWailes, Tomasetti and Matlin swiftly corrected that. They turned one of the seats so it would face the door and arranged the furniture in a circle so the Rossi family could easily sign to each other. The family room’s layout is one of the grounding details in a film full of them – now, that film has won best picture at the 2022 Academy Awards. Those moments may not have been possible without the constant collaboration of deaf crew members.\n\n“CODA” is one of several projects released in the last year to star deaf actors and skirt stereotypical deaf stories – Lauren Ridloff stole scenes as a speedster superhero in Marvel’s “Eternals” Millicent Simmonds helped defeat monsters in “A Quiet Place Part II,” while Matlin and her family fought to save their business in “CODA.” Their deafness isn’t always central to the plot, but when it is, those storylines are handled with care and nuance – because, in most cases, they were developed with the help of deaf consultants and experts of American Sign Language (ASL).\n\nDouglas Ridloff, who served as an ASL coach on “Eternals” (in which his wife Lauren starred) and “A Quiet Place” (parts I and II), said in a conversation with CNN and interpreter Ramon Norrod that more productions are incorporating deaf crew members into the filmmaking process from the very beginning – steps that even five years ago were rarely taken.\n\n“They start to realize the value of the deaf person’s perspective and the input into their film production,” Ridloff said of filmmakers and production crews. “It just shows that they value the deaf person’s perspective and they want more of that.”\n\nHow deaf creatives make films better\n\nInvolving deaf creators at every step of the production process – from ASL coaches for actors to consultants on story elements and blocking– improves both the story the production is telling and the set atmosphere for deaf cast and crew, said Ridloff, who also worked on Marvel’s “Hawkeye” series and Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\nDeaf consultants, directors of Artistic Sign Language and coaches of ASL all bring their experiences to their work, Ridloff said, something that would be impossible for a hearing person to replicate.\n\n“A director, if they’re hearing and they don’t know sign language – how would they be able to capture those little nuances, the facial expressions, the signing, the pausing?” he said. “That’s where we as deaf people come in.”\n\nRidloff said he likes to be involved in a film’s creation from the very beginning. He’ll translate lines in a script from spoken English to ASL, choosing the signs and techniques that correlate to a character’s development, and will recommend actors who can pick up signing quickly. On set, he’ll watch a scene through a monitor, taking note of how the camera picks up an actor’s signing and whether the actor is signing correctly. And then, once a film has wrapped, he’ll assist its editors in selecting shots that keep an actor’s signed lines in the frame in a way that preserves the nuance of what they’re signing. He’ll correct subtitles, too, in case the changes he made to the script before production began don’t make it to the editing bay.\n\nNot all productions are that collaborative, but Wailes, in a conversation with CNN and interpreter Heather Rossi, said that Heder’s willingness to cooperate on “CODA” while adhering to her original vision was what made the film so strong in its portrayal of deaf characters – and such a trusting atmosphere for its deaf actors and crew.\n\nWailes went through Heder’s script – which won best adapted screenplay at the 2022 Oscars – line by line before production started, choosing how protagonist Ruby, a high school senior who’s withdrawn at school but free with her family, might sign to her parents when she’s in a sour mood. Not every line in spoken English had an ASL equivalent, so Heder, Wailes and Tomasetti would rework a line that kept the character’s intent and translated easily to ASL.\n\n“We were just gardening,” Wailes said of the pre-production experience. “We laid the seeds and we were letting it all grow.”\n\nKnowing there were deaf collaborators behind the camera was steadying for actors in “CODA,” too, she said.\n\n“That gave everybody the space to breathe and to really be free, and not worry too much about what was captured on camera,” Wailes said. “Oftentimes, deaf actors have to worry about all of these things because they’re the only person in the room.”\n\nDeaf audiences’ take on deaf actors in mainstream film and TV\n\nRecent films and TV series that incorporate deaf characters, played by deaf actors, have been received warmly by many deaf and hearing audiences.\n\nThree of the central roles in “CODA” went to deaf actors – Matlin, an Oscar winner and perhaps the most famous working deaf actor in the US, Troy Kotsur as her gruff fisherman husband and Daniel Durant, who plays her son. “Eternals” cast Lauren Ridloff, a mixed-race actress, as a character who in the comics was a hearing white man. One crucial episode of Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” was nearly silent, told from the perspective of a deaf resident.\n\nThese works don’t satisfy all deaf audiences, though: In the case of “CODA,” some deaf viewers took issue with the film’s focus on music – in one scene, Ruby’s family attends her concert and the sound drops from the film to show their perspective – plus the seeming burden it is for Ruby to interpret for her family. The casting of Riz Ahmed as the lead in the Oscar-winning “Sound of Metal,” as a heavy metal drummer who loses his hearing throughout the film, also offended some viewers, though some deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences who, like Ahmed’s character, lost their hearing later in life, were moved by his performance.\n\nSome works starring deaf characters aren’t always accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences: Lauren Ridloff in an interview bemoaned the lack of accessibility at movie theaters. (AMC is one theatrical chain that last year announced plans to add more open-caption screenings for deaf audiences.)\n\nBut productions made with the input of deaf collaborators, preferably starring deaf actors, do move the needle for representation and what’s possible for future works of art about the experiences of deaf people, wrote Jenna Fischtrom Beacom, a deaf activist and writer who often covers the way deaf people are portrayed in the media. At the end of a blog post in which she outlined the parts of “CODA” that she felt were inauthentic, she wrote, “May CODA pave the way for the many talented deaf writers, directors, editors, cinematographers, and more to have their chance to tell stories that are even more authentic.”\n\nNot all film sets have been accommodating to deaf creatives\n\nRidloff and Wailes believe that the first mistake a production can make when telling stories about deaf characters is casting hearing actors in deaf roles.\n\n“Someone else trying to wear that language – you can’t,” Wailes said. “It’s in our bones. It’s who we are … they’re trying to imitate, and that’s not going to work.”\n\n“La Famille Bélier,” the French film “CODA” was loosely based on, notably cast hearing actors as the protagonist’s deaf parents, a decision that was widely condemned by critics. Heder knew to avoid missing the same opportunities of honestly portraying a deaf family and child of deaf adults, she needed to involve deaf creators from the beginning.\n\nSiân Heder (center) worked closely with deaf collaborators before, during and after filming \"CODA.\" Mark Hill/Apple TV+\n\n“I have a lot of faith in my abilities as a storyteller,” she told CNN. “But I knew in order to get it right that I was amplifying the voices of my actors and my collaborators who knew what it was like to live and move through the world [as a deaf person].”\n\nRidloff said he’s been a part of projects where ASL consultants are more of an afterthought, where there aren’t enough interpreters for him to communicate efficiently with directors and actors, or a deaf character’s storyline wasn’t as true as it could have been had it been written by a deaf person, he said.\n\nWailes chalks up those challenges to a lack of funding, little research, short production time frames and, perhaps most prohibitive, the fear of not being able to communicate with a deaf person. That fear often keeps storytellers from even attempting to produce films or TV series about deaf characters, she said.\n\nOvercoming that fear or emphasizing just how much a production can improve if deaf crew members are involved “can be a dance,” she said, but it’s a process that’s steadily improving.\n\n“Right now, there is absolutely more of a presence of different deaf creatives, deaf artists – they’ve been around forever, but you’re just all seeing them now!” she said. “There are so many stories, so many intricacies, so many worldly perspectives that we have that people don’t know about.”\n\nWhere the future of deaf-led films is headed\n\nHeder was drawn to the story of “CODA” because there were so few films that had focused on a deaf family in that way.\n\n“It was important to me to show how free and comfortable deaf spaces can be, and then how different that is once you introduce the barrier that the hearing world puts up,” she said.\n\nAnd with “CODA’s” success – before its Oscar wins, it was acquired by Apple TV+ out of last year’s Sundance Film Festival, where it won the US Grand Jury Prize – and the success of “Eternals,” “A Quiet Place” and more, the trend of deaf-starring films continues.\n\nSiân Heder said she was open to collaboration throughout the filmmaking process to make \"CODA\" stronger. Mark Hill/Apple TV+\n\nBut to continue to improve a production’s portrayal of deaf characters, Ridloff has a few guidelines that begin with hiring deaf people – actors, crew members, writers, producers – in the first place, and making sure deaf people are involved at every level of the production process. Hiring at least two to three deaf consultants and ASL coaches is key, too, he said, as is employing enough interpreters so everyone is able to communicate efficiently. All of these guidelines come from a place of wanting a story to be the best, truest version of what it could be, he said, and if hearing and deaf collaborators keep that spirit in mind, they’ll be set up for success.\n\nThe future of deaf representation in entertainment is bright: Ridloff will serve as consulting producer on “Echo,” an upcoming Disney+ series that spotlights a deaf Indigenous superhero, his most involved role yet and his third time working with Marvel. Wailes has a few projects still under wraps but, she’s excited to share more soon. And Kotsur won an Oscar for his performance, making him the first deaf man to earn an acting nomination and second deaf acting winner after co-star Matlin.\n\nBut most rewarding, Ridloff and Wailes said, is when they see their experiences, their language, portrayed on screen with all of its beauty. In “CODA,” there’s a moment when Ruby, asked how she feels when she sings, can only express herself in sign language – balling up the tightness in her stomach and letting it go. Words wouldn’t do that feeling justice.\n\nThat’s how Ridloff and Wailes said they feel when they perform – Ridloff is also the founder of ASL SLAM, a poetry organization, and Wailes is a dancer who’s appeared in Broadway productions with Deaf West Theatre. To them, ASL is a theatrical language on its own, so helping to incorporate it into film and TV is a chance to share that beauty with a wider audience.\n\n“I breathe American Sign Language,” Ridloff said. “When ASL stops, then I will stop breathing.”", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/01/mister-rogers-civics-education-fishy-promotion-news-around-states/49308903/", "title": "Mister Rogers, civics education: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican-led committees in the Legislature advanced new congressional, legislative and school board districts Friday as lawmakers try to get new maps in place in time for the 2022 election. The House State Government Committee voted along party lines to approve new lines for the state’s seven congressional districts and 105 districts in the Alabama House of Representatives. Democrats, who voted against the plans, raised concerns that the proposed lines don’t reflect a state that has grown more diverse and would pack their supporters into a single congressional district. And while the plan passed with GOP support, several Republicans expressed concern that their legislative districts had been sacrificed for other party priorities. The maps, along with Alabama Senate and Board of Education districts, are in line for votes Monday by the full Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate. Democrats have argued that Alabama, whose population is about 26% Black, should have a second congressional district with a significant African American or minority population. The seven-member delegation has for decades included a single African American, elected from the only district with a majority-Black population. The district is now represented by Rep. Terri Sewell, who’s also the only Democrat in Alabama’s congressional delegation.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: The city wants to create a new “main street” running parallel to the Kenai River. City officials on Thursday applied for a $360,000 federal grant that they hope would fund planning for the project that is also expected to boost capital investment in the area, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The planning project is estimated to take about 18 months and would help with efforts to design a new “main street” adjacent to the river. It would address about 85 acres of land running along the Kenai River, from Soldotna Creek Park to the Sterling Highway bridge. Many of the riverfront properties are privately owned, and development would require private and public partnerships. Currently, there is no road or trail that offers developed public access or views of the Kenai River between the highway bridge and state-owned land. Three dead-end roads stop short of the river. “Based on the number of no trespassing signs in many places the river today is more of an attractive nuisance than an asset,” city documents say. City officials informed City Council members that previous discussions with landowners indicated their support for collecting more information to determine the project’s feasibility. If approved, funding for the grant would come from the American Rescue Plan. Soldotna has already spent $90,000 of its own funds on the project.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly five years after Joe Arpaio was voted out as sheriff of Maricopa County, taxpayers are covering one of the last major bills from the thousands of lawsuits the lawman’s headline-grabbing tactics inspired – and the overall legal tab has hit $100 million. County officials agreed last month to pay $3.1 million to cover the county’s portion of a settlement with a restaurant owner who alleged Arpaio defamed him and violated his rights when raiding his businesses. The payout boosted the cost stemming from Arpaio’s six terms to $100 million for attorney fees, settlements and other costs the county has paid from lawsuits over things such as jail deaths, failed investigations of the sheriff’s political enemies and immigration raids of businesses. That doesn’t include the separate $178 million and counting taxpayers have shelled out in a 2007 racial profiling case stemming from Arpaio’s signature traffic patrols targeting immigrants, though about 75% of that spending has occurred during his successor’s watch as he works to comply with court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff’s office. Advocates for immigrants have long warned Arpaio should be viewed as a cautionary tale for the long-term financial obligations communities take on when they let local police officers handle immigration enforcement.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A special election will be called to fill the term of Republican state Sen. Lance Eads, who resigned from his position Thursday to take a job in the private sector. Eads, who won reelection last year to a four-year term, represented a district in northwest Arkansas that includes Springdale and parts of eastern Washington County. He said he was resigning to take a consultant job with the Little Rock-based lobbying firm Capitol Consulting Firm. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Eads will remain a resident of northwest Arkansas. Eads served two years in the House of Representatives before first winning election to the Senate in 2016. Gov. Asa Hutchinson must call a special election to fill the vacancy in the Senate. “Sen. Lance Eads has served his community well,” Hutchinson said Thursday. “He has been a good partner in the successes we have achieved in Arkansas from economic development to lowering taxes.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nNewport Beach: Four weeks after an oil spill washed blobs of crude onto Southern California’s coast, surfers have returned to the waves, and people play in the surf. But fishermen still can’t drop lines in the same waters. California has prohibited fishing in an area that ranges about 6 to 12 miles off the shores of Orange County since an undersea pipeline leaked at least about 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. State environmental health experts are conducting studies to determine whether shellfish and fish are safe for human consumption – a process expected to take weeks or longer. Scott Breneman, owner of West Caught Fish, said he still fishes for tuna and black cod well beyond the prohibited area. He said he’s been able to keep selling his catch to restaurants, but customers aren’t buying like they usually do at a popular Newport Beach fish market because of concerns about the state fishing ban. “People assume that local fish is contaminated, and we’re fishing like 90 miles off the beach here, a long ways away,” Breneman said, adding that he’s heading out fishing about half as much as usual. “I don’t want to take the resource when I can’t sell it.” Commercial fishermen and charter operators have been hit especially hard. Some have joined lawsuits against pipeline owner Amplify Energy of Houston and worry about lingering effects on tourism.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A former long-shot Idaho gubernatorial candidate on trial in the 1984 killing of a 12-year-old Colorado girl has testified that he did not know the girl or her family before she vanished and denied being involved in her disappearance. At the time, Steve Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle Matthew and her family in Greeley, about 50 miles north of Denver. The girl’s remains were found by oil and gas workers in 2019. She had been fatally shot. Pankey was charged with Jonelle’s murder last year after showing extreme interest in the case for many years and allegedly sharing details with investigators that had not been made public. Pankey said in court that he pretended to know information about the case out of bitterness for police and for his former church and former employer, both of which he wanted investigated, KCNC-TV reports. Most of his testimony Thursday to questions by his lawyer was rambling and included comments about his hatred of racist police officers. District Attorney Michael J. Rourke pressed him about his views about police, which Pankey said came from seeing officers humiliate and hurt Hispanic people while he was working for an ambulance service in California. Pankey said he refused to put a splint on a sheriff’s deputy who broke his leg, letting the deputy ride to the hospital in pain. He said the deputy screamed for eight or 12 minutes. “I sat there and watched,” Pankey said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: The state’s attorney general is investigating the closure of Quinnipiac University’s Great Irish Hunger Museum, which shut its doors permanently in August after nine years dedicated to study of what’s commonly known as the Irish potato famine. Attorney General William Tong’s spokesperson Elizabeth Benton confirmed the probe to the New Haven Register on Thursday, saying in a statement that “we have an open and ongoing inquiry into this matter.” Tong took up the investigation after a lawyer representing an organization dedicated to saving the Hamden museum sent a letter to his office, raising concerns about the prospect of museum artifacts being sold off. The group, the Committee to Save the Great Irish Hunger Museum, was planning a “salute to the museum” Saturday with Irish dancing, food and treats. A Quinnipiac spokesperson told the Register that the university is “not selling any” items and that it’s committed to finding a way to ensure the collection “remains publicly accessible, advances the museum’s original mission, and preserves the story of the Great Hunger.” Morgan said the university is cooperating with the attorney general’s inquiry. Morgan said Quinnipiac decided to close the museum because of funding shortfalls and a lack of interest from visitors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Lawmakers in the state House don’t have enough votes to petition the governor to remove indicted Auditor Kathy McGuiness, who refuses to step down or take a leave of absence while she faces an indictment for alleged abuse of office. Instead, they appear to prefer a proposal from the Senate to ask the courts for advice on how to execute the constitutional law that sanctions the removal process, which has not been touched in living memory. Meanwhile, a judge ruled Thursday that McGuiness must be provided a public defender or pay for her own private attorney to fight criminal corruption charges. The ruling settles a conflict between McGuiness and Delaware prosecutors, who argued that McGuiness, by virtue of her public office, was entitled to a public defender, not her choice of a more expensive, private attorney to be funded by the public. McGuiness faces two felony charges and multiple public corruption misdemeanors, all of which carry the potential of more than 10 years in prison. Specifically, she is accused of giving her daughter a do-little job in the auditor’s office, rigging state contracts to avoid regulatory scrutiny and intimidating those who questioned her behavior, according to an indictment filed against her last month.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ahead of the holiday season, the National Park Service planted a new National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse in President’s Park on Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The new tree is a 27-foot white fir from Middleburg, Pennsylvania, the park service said in a release. Donated by Hill View Christmas Tree Farm, it will be the first white fir to serve as the National Christmas Tree. Since 1973, the National Christmas Tree has been a living tree that people can view year-round at President’s Park. The National Park Service said a white fir was selected because it is more resilient to needle cast disease, a fungal issue that affects spruce trees and causes their needles to fall off. The previous tree, a Colorado blue spruce planted in October 2019, succumbed to needle cast disease, according to the National Park Service. NPS officials say transporting and taking care of such a large tree can be challenging and requires careful planning and mild weather conditions. Late October is an ideal time for planting, but there is still a chance for transplant shock, experts say. NPS horticulturists will keep an eye on the tree’s health and ensure its transition is as easy as possible. The tree will be lit up during the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, details of which have not been announced yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nWinter Park: A little rain didn’t stop it from being a beautiful day at Rollins College as school officials unveiled a sculpture honoring alumnus and beloved children’s TV host Mister Rogers. Rollins President Grant Cornwell and others held umbrellas during Thursday’s private ceremony as they pulled back a drape on the bronze rendering of Rogers in his iconic sweater and tennis shoes, a work entitled “A Beautiful Day for a Neighbor.” “This inspirational sculpture will be a permanent reminder of the ideals and values modeled by Mister Rogers as he set out to make the world a better place,” Cornwell said during the ceremony at the private liberal arts college in Winter Park, just northeast of Orlando. Years before the world came to know him as Mister Rogers, Fred McFeely Rogers transferred to Rollins College in 1948 and graduated in 1951, according to the school. He majored in music composition and served as president of his fraternity and chairman of the Inter-Faith and Race Relations Committee. He also met his future wife at the school. He received an honorary degree from the school in 1974. The 360-degree sculpture designed by Paul Day, a British artist known for his public monuments, depicts Rogers surrounded by children, hand puppets from his show, lyrics from the theme song for “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the show’s Neighborhood Trolley. The sculpture will be part of the school’s Mister Rogers Walking Tour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Former residents of a Black neighborhood that was destroyed more than 50 years ago and replaced with university dorms and parking lots are demanding the university recognize their loss. The city used eminent domain to force Black families out of the Linnentown neighborhood in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal plan. It sold the land to the state Board of Regents, and dorms and parking lots for the University of Georgia went up after the homes were razed. Now, a group of former residents and descendants wants the university to apologize for the land seizure and create a memorial to Linnentown, which was home to dozens of Black families, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. One member of the Linnentown Project group, Bobby Crook, told the newspaper the university needs to pay compensation, though he acknowledged that may not happen. The average condemnation award for homes in the neighborhood was $5,750, according to a resolution approved by Athens-Clarke County commissioners in February. The land – roughly 20 acres – and the improvements on it are worth tens of millions of dollars today. The county resolution did not mince words, accusing the city and the University System of Georgia of “an act of institutionalized white racism and terrorism resulting in intergenerational Black poverty, dissolution of family units, and trauma through the forcible removal and displacement of Black families, and the accumulation of the majority of their wealth and political power within the University System of Georgia and the City of Athens.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKihei: A new high school on Maui won’t be welcoming students as planned next fall because the state Department of Education didn’t build a pedestrian bridge to the campus. The state Land Use Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to stick to its earlier decision to require the state to build the bridge over Piilani Highway to Kihei High School, Hawaii News Now reports. That means the school won’t be able to open for the fall 2022 semester. The busy highway separates the school from neighborhoods where many students live. Currently, public school students in Kihei are enrolled at Maui High School, which is overcrowded. There are some charter school options in the area. The commission in 2013 said either a pedestrian overpass or an underpass would be required for safety. “It’s a shame that this high school, which is almost built, will not be open on time,” said Dan Giovanni, the commission’s vice chairperson. “To me, the fault for that is the DOE.” A department spokesperson said the department is assessing its next steps. Department officials said the state Department of Transportation advised them that a pedestrian bridge was not yet necessary because only a few students were scheduled to start school in August 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers will gather this month to consider legislation banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the federal government and private employers, according to top lawmakers in the House and Senate. Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro Tem Chuck Winder said the chambers will likely return for several days Nov. 15. The House never officially adjourned, and it can reconvene if called by Bedke. Winder said he would recommend senators return as well. Bedke said he expects about a dozen pieces of legislation to be introduced, including some to prevent employers from requiring workers get vaccinated. He said lawmakers getting between the employee-employer relationship wasn’t his preference, but some lawmakers supported the idea. “The objective is to get all of the various ideas out into the public domain so that everyone can take a look at them, to start the process,” Bedke said. “I don’t know how many of them, if any of them, will get critical legislative mass, in our bicameral system, but we’ll see.” Both said lawmakers will look at legislation that would allow the state to initiate legal action over federal vaccine mandates on private employers. The legislation would include $2 million for a potential legal battle.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A conservation group has reached an agreement with a northern Illinois airport that temporarily halts work on a project that would destroy an 8,000-year-old tract of remnant prairie. The Bell Bowl Prairie, located on the Rockford Airport’s property, is targeted for demolition as part of a $50 million expansion of the airfield’s cargo operations. The prairie’s longtime stewards, the Natural Land Institute, sued the Greater Rockford Airport Authority last week, seeking injunctive relief to temporarily halt bulldozers from destroying the 25-acre prairie. The nonprofit conservation group announced Thursday that a deal putting that work on hold through March 1, 2022, had been reached through U.S. District Court with the Greater Rockford Airport Authority, its board of commissioners and executive director, WTTW-TV reports. Construction of an access road that would cut through the prairie’s highest-quality habitat had been slated to resume Monday. The temporary hold buys more time for the Natural Land Institute to convince the Airport Authority to explore alternative design concepts that protect the prairie and the endangered rusty patched bumblebee, the institute said in a statement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal appeals court has cleared the way for state officials to start enforcing a law requiring reports from doctors if they treat women for complications arising from abortions, even though the court said the law could be struck down in the future. Action by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last week followed a 2-1 ruling by a court panel in August upholding the law, which had been blocked by a judge shortly after it was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2018. The law lists 25 physical or psychological conditions – including unsuccessful abortions, infections, uterine perforations, depression and deaths – that could trigger the reporting requirement for doctors or clinics. It makes failure to do so a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Planned Parenthood challenged the law in federal court, arguing that it was vague and would leave medical professionals uncertain in determining whether they needed to report conditions such as a patient’s anxiety or minor bleeding regardless of whether they believed it stemmed from the abortion. The Chicago-based appeals court last week turned down Planned Parenthood’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, and it issued an order Thursday allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A school board candidate changed his name following conviction on a threat of terrorism charge last year after he said he would shoot up a high school and sexually assault students. Christian Mathew Holtz, 20, of Ankeny, is one of seven candidates running in Tuesday’s election for school board in the Ankeny Community School District. His campaign has focused on addressing bullying, protecting marginalized groups and being a younger voice for students on the board, among other issues. Holtz has been running his campaign and participating in candidate forums as he remains on probation for the threat of terrorism charge, a felony, according to court records. In March 2020, Holtz – then known as Isaac Quinton Holtz – was charged in Dallas County District Court after police accused him of sending an email to more than 750 Waukee High School students and staff saying he planned to come to the school with a gun, shoot all the students, and go into the locker room to sexually assault and murder girls. According to a criminal complaint, police said he admitted to sending the email. Holtz entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges that the evidence would probably persuade a judge or jury otherwise. He was sentenced to three years of probation. Reached by phone Friday, Holtz would not directly confirm or deny he is the same person involved in that case. “It’s not me because I’m not Issac anymore,” Holtz said. “I’m Christian.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates rallied Saturday at the Statehouse and pushed state lawmakers to quickly counter them, while an international labor union disavowed a local leader’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews. The rally kicked off ahead of a rare weekend legislative committee hearing on mandates from President Joe Biden that affect as many as 100 million Americans. The hearing gave dozens of mandate opponents a chance to vent their frustration and anger with the White House and with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s handling of the pandemic. Several critics of the mandates suggested Saturday that they violate international human rights standards enacted in the wake of atrocities during World War II. Bryan Luedeke, a Wichita-area aircraft worker, called them “reminiscent of Nazi Germany.” His comments followed Friday’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust by Cornell Beard, president of the Wichita district of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A committee member, Rep. Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, appeared to agree with the analogy.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that jails cannot force inmates to pay for their confinement if their criminal charges are dropped or if they are found not guilty. Ruling for a Winchester man who was billed more than $4,000 for his incarceration, even though a felony charge against him was dismissed, the court said inmates can only be charged if the payment is ordered by their sentencing judge. And because people who are acquitted or have charges dropped are never sentenced, they can’t be required to pay, the court said in a 12-page opinion Thursday. Greg Belzley, the attorney for David Allen Jones, said the ruling is a “huge” victory for the presumption of innocence. Belzley said he will ask that the ruling be applied to all inmates who are exonerated or have charges dropped, which could have serious financial implications for the commonwealth’s jails. “Jails are crumbling, but the way that gets addressed is through taxes, not by going after our poorest citizens,” he said. “We are delighted with the ruling.” The attorney for the Clark County Detention Center, Jeff Mando, had argued in a brief that the presumption of innocence does not apply to jail fees because they are not “punitive.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state Senate has created a special committee to dig into complaints about the use of excessive force by the State Police, after troopers were documented in a series of beatings of Black men that have drawn attention from federal investigators. Senate President Page Cortez said he set up the seven-member advisory panel in response to requests from senators concerned about troopers’ behavior. He sent a letter Thursday officially naming lawmakers to the committee. Two senators from Baton Rouge will lead the work: Republican Sen. Franklin Foil will be chairman, and Democratic Sen. Cleo Fields will work as vice chairman. Foil intends to hold the panel’s first meeting in December, he said, and expects the committee to hear from the State Police and the public with an eye toward developing recommendations for tightened laws regarding use of force that legislators can consider. The review will focus more on overall policies, rather than specific allegations of improper force, he said. The Senate Select Committee on State Police Oversight will “go over what kind of oversight the State Police has when there are reports of excessive force that may have been used inappropriately and what mechanisms they have as far as safeguards,” said Foil, a lawyer and Navy officer who has worked as a military judge.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Health care centers are facing a staffing crunch, but COVID-19 vaccination mandates are not the cause, according to the chief of the largest health network in the state. MaineHealth CEO Andrew Mueller said the organization has a staff vacancy rate of about 10% and described that level of staffing loss as “really, really difficult” for the organization, especially at a time when hospitals are full. However, he said, the shortage can be attributed to an aging workforce and workers leaving the industry because of the stress of working during the pandemic. The deadline to begin enforcing the vaccine requirement for health care workers across the state arrived Friday. Mueller had said that he expected to lose 1.5% to 2% of staff systemwide but that those losses would be offset by fewer COVID-19-related absences. “We actually think we’re going to have more capability and less shortages in a real way by ensuring our workforce is vaccinated,” he said last week. Meanwhile, Northern Light Health announced that unvaccinated workers would no longer be working at its 10 hospitals as of Saturday. In Lewiston, Central Maine Medical Center was already in compliance, with unvaccinated staff members not allowed to work.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state lawmaker who is a plastic surgeon has been fined $15,000 and reprimanded for twice participating in legislative meetings via videoconference from an operating room during surgery. Del. Terri Hill signed a consent order last month agreeing to the disciplinary actions from the Maryland Board of Physicians, which found the Democratic lawmaker guilty of “unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.” The board noted that Hill participated in one voting session of a House committee while appearing in a video feed wearing “a surgical gown, facemask, and surgical cap.” In Maryland’s legislative session this year, legislative committee meetings were held by videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The public was able to livestream the meetings and hearings. “She was positioned under the surgical lights, focused downward, and would occasionally shift, reach for surgical instruments, or adjust the lights,” the board’s report said, noting the surgeon and other operating room staff “occasionally moved surgical equipment and blood-stained towels so that they were briefly visible on the video feed.” In a statement Friday night, Hill said she has worked hard to fulfill her professional obligations to both her patients and her constituents during the pandemic – a balance that has been challenging at times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Students will have greater access to school meals under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The new law requires schools or districts to implement universal free breakfast and lunch for all students if a majority of students in the school meet low-income criteria. The law also bars school employees or volunteers from publicly identifying a student when payment for a meal hasn’t been received. Denying a student a meal as a form of punishment for bad behavior or disposing of an already served meal because of a student’s unresolved meal debt is also banned. Schools will also be prevented from denying a student or their sibling the chance to participate in non-fee-based extracurricular activities because of meal debt; prohibiting a student from receiving grades, transcripts, report cards or graduating as a result of meal debt; or requiring a parent or guardian to pay additional fees or interest costs above the amount owed for meals. “This legislation is another way we can ensure all children in the commonwealth have access to healthy meals when they are in school,” Baker said after signing the bill last Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: As promised, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-sponsored legislation that would toughen in-person voter identification rules and require people to include additional information such as their driver’s license number on absentee ballot applications. The governor said the bills would disproportionately hurt minority voters who are more likely not to have a photo ID on Election Day than white voters. They also would prohibit the secretary of state and clerks from mailing absentee ballot applications unless voters request them and ban private donations to help administer elections. “Voting restrictions that produce such a racially disparate impact must never become law in this state,” Whitmer wrote to lawmakers. A GOP-affiliated ballot committee, Secure MI Vote, is circulating petitions that would enable the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a similar initiative next year regardless of Whitmer’s opposition. In Michigan, voters who go to a polling place without a photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they sign an affidavit. More than 11,400 did so in the 2020 presidential election. Under the legislation, they would get a provisional ballot and have to verify their identity with the local clerk within six days of an election for their vote to count. The governor said the change would disenfranchise voters, and there is no evidence that affidavit ballots are related to voter fraud.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Sales at municipal liquor stores in the state soared in 2020 for a record-breaking year. Sales at Minnesota’s 213 “munis” jumped 10% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report released last week by State Auditor Julie Blaha. In recent years, a typical sales increase has been in the range of 1% to 3%. With many bars and restaurants either closed or operating at reduced capacity during parts of the year, people did more of their drinking at home, according to liquor store managers and employees. And the lifestyle shifts prompted by the pandemic played a major role. The Star Tribune reports the bars and liquor stores transferred more than $21 million back to their local governments in 2020, helping supplement traditional tax revenue. According to the International Wines and Spirits Record, Americans consumed 2% more alcohol last year than in 2019. It was the biggest year-over-year increase since 2002.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL player Brett Favre and Mississippi Auditor Shad White feuded Friday over the auditor saying Favre failed to make speeches after being paid by welfare money. The Twitter spat happened days after Favre repaid $600,000 to the state – the last portion of the $1.1 million that the auditor said Favre received from a nonprofit organization that used money intended to help needy people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. The auditor said Wednesday that Favre still owes $228,000 in interest, and the state attorney general could sue if that is not paid by mid-November. “Of course the money was returned because I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,” Favre wrote Friday. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback, who lives in Mississippi, wrote that he made commercials for which he was paid by a nonprofit group. White tweeted that Favre’s contract required speeches and a radio ad. “The CPA for Favre Enterprises confirmed this was your contract,” White replied to Favre. “You did not give the speeches. You have acknowledged this in statements to my agents.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Professional sports teams are trying to put a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state on the ballot, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. A Jefferson City lawyer filed nine ballot proposals on the issue last week on behalf of the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, St. Louis City soccer club and Kansas City Royals. Money from taxing sports betting would be split between schools and roads under the proposals. Efforts to pass a law allowing sports betting have failed for years in Missouri’s GOP-led Legislature, so the teams are hoping to take the issue directly before voters. Republican Sen. Denny Hoskins has proposed several bills to legalize sports betting. But he warned that legalizing sports betting through the Missouri Constitution will mean lawmakers can’t easily address any potential issues with the program once it’s enacted. In Missouri, proposals need a certain number of voter signatures to be put on the ballot. Backers haven’t started collecting signatures yet.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental regulators ignored the law when they permitted an expansion of a massive strip mine that is the sole source of coal for a large power plant despite concerns about water pollution, a judge ruled. State District Judge Katherine Bidegaray ordered the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to revisit its 2015 permit to expand the 25,752-acre Rosebud Mine, owned by Colorado-based Westmoreland mining. The judge’s Thursday order came after environmental groups sued over damage to a nearby creek from wastewater that flows out of the mine. Rosebud, in the Powder River Basin along the Montana-Wyoming border, fuels the Colstrip Power Plant that burns about 8 million tons of coal annually. For years, nearby East Fork Armells Creek has received salty water from the mine and contaminants from coal ash ponds at the power plant, The Billings Gazette reports. The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act forbids the state from issuing mine permits unless it can be proven there won’t be damage to the balance of water outside the permit area. But Bidegaray said the state was doing the opposite – allowing harmful salt levels in Armells to increase. It’s unclear what the ruling means for mining operations, a Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Christian student group has sued the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, alleging that the school discriminated against the group’s views when it denied a funding request to bring a Christian philosopher to campus as a guest speaker. The federal lawsuit by the group Ratio Christi alleges that the university failed to distribute money to student groups in a fair, viewpoint-neutral manner, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The lawsuit says Ratio Christi requested $1,500 in January from the university’s Fund Allocation Committee, which it was entitled to do as a recognized student organization. The group wanted to bring in philosopher and former university professor Robert Audi, who is currently a philosophy professor at the University of Notre Dame. The students were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization that supports conservative Christian causes. The lawsuit alleges that the university’s program council told Ratio Christi it would need to invite another person from a different ideological perspective to the same event to receive funding. The school allegedly said it could not promote speakers of an ideological nature with its student organization funding, according to the lawsuit. In a statement Friday, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts called on university Chancellor Ronnie Green to intervene and define policies that encourage all viewpoints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hundreds of hotel, casino and restaurant workers in matching red shirts rallied Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip as the Culinary Union made a second monthly call to return people to jobs idled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Culinary Union said more than one-third of its 60,000 members haven’t been rehired, despite a recovery by casinos and hotels from closures imposed in March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “If companies are going to charge you the full rate, you want to make sure you get full service,” union President Ted Pappageorge said, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The message echoed calls made Sept. 24, when the Culinary Union organized a march of thousands of members on the Strip. Casinos statewide have ridden a tourism surge to set monthly winnings records, room rates have rebounded, and tourism officials report the number of visitors is approaching pre-pandemic levels. Nevada’s unemployment rate in September was 7.5%, down slightly from 7.7% in August. That’s more than twice the record low of 3.6% in February 2020 but far below the record peak of more than 30% set in April 2020 – a month after businesses and casinos were shuttered. The union says many idled employees have exhausted public unemployment benefits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed its Homebound Vaccination program for COVID-19 shots. Appointments are being scheduled to provide first, second and booster doses of the vaccines to people who are unable to leave their homes, have difficulty doing so, or have been advised by a medical provider that their health could worsen by leaving their home. The state Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with On-Site Medical Services in Newport to conduct the program. Appointments can be made by calling (603) 338-9292 from Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., filling out a form at www.onsitenh.com/vaccine, or emailing vaccinations@on-sitemedservices.com.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEnglewood: An eatery offered Bergen County voters what some considered a great catch for participating in the democratic process, but others say something’s fishy with the promotion. If customers showed that they cast their ballot Friday or Saturday – presumably by displaying an “I voted” sticker – they were eligible for a free fried fish sandwich at TJ’s Southern Gourmet. A state statute on bribery says offering or receiving “money or other valuable consideration” to induce someone to vote or not vote “shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree.” The fried whiting sandwiches being offered by TJ’s – and the giveaway’s promotion by Teaneck school board member Victoria Fisher, who is up for reelection – is cause for concern for some people. Teaneck Councilman Keith Kaplan said Friday that he sent information about the fried fish sandwiches to Bergen County Superintendent of Elections Debra Francica and that he would send it to the state attorney general if needed. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the offer for free whiting, which typically sells for $8 and is described by reviewers as “fried to perfection.” Francica, however, said she had “checked with the AG’s office, and that’s legal.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Researchers say they have more evidence that Chaco Canyon was more than just an ancient gathering spot for Indigenous ceremonies and rituals. The researchers from the University of Cincinnati analyzed pollen content and the chemical composition of soils to help document environmental impacts of the early residents who called the area home. Their findings, published last week in the journal PLOS ONE, focus on changes resulting from tree harvesting that sustained daily life at Chaco. The researchers reported a gradual degradation of the surrounding woodlands beginning around 600 B.C., much earlier than previously thought. While some of the mysteries surrounding Chaco, now a national park and UNESCO World Heritage site, are still debated in academic circles, there’s agreement that the massive stone buildings, ceremonial structures called kivas and other features that dot the landscape offered a religious or ritualistic experience for the ancestors of today’s Native American pueblos. Many of Chaco’s structures are aligned with celestial events, such as the summer solstice. David Lentz, a biology professor and lead author of the study, said many researchers have the idea that Chaco was too arid to sustain day-to-day living and that the infrastructure built over many centuries at Chaco was used only as a periodic ceremonial center and storage facility. Lentz said that explanation is too simplistic, and his team turned up evidence to support human management of the area’s environment to support daily life.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Nine in 10 municipal workers received COVID-19 vaccinations as a Monday deadline loomed under a city mandate, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. City officials have been making contingency plans to deal with an expected staffing shortfall Monday. De Blasio tweeted Saturday night that 91% of city workers had received the vaccine, which represented a jump from about 83% as of Friday night. Under a city mandate, those who haven’t received at least one dose of a vaccine against the disease will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday, raising the possibility of shortages of police, fire and EMS workers. New York has more than 300,000 employees. The police department, which employs about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, reported an 84% vaccination rate as of Sunday morning, while roughly 2 in 10 of the fire department’s roughly 17,000 employees remained unvaccinated as of Friday night. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro denied reports that some firehouses had been closed due to shortages. “Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters,” he said in a statement Sunday. And six Brooklyn-based firefighters angry with the mandate were pulled from duty and suspended after driving a fire truck to a state senator’s office and threatening his staff over the requirement, with which the lawmaker wasn’t involved.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Bus drivers for the state’s largest school system called in sick Friday to protest working conditions, prompting administrators to urge parents to arrange their own transportation and warn of similar problems this week. Officials with the Wake County Public School System said 400 of the 600 buses operated by the system were running, news outlets report. Bus drivers have said concerns about being overworked and underpaid haven’t been addressed. Many parents said their children walked to school, or they were driven to school when their buses didn’t show up. The Wake County system has 160,000 students, and up to half of them ride the bus in a normal year. Wake County Superintendent Cathy Moore and school board chairman Keith Sutton wrote in a message to staff members: “The pay and salary structure for the work we do is not adequate. Our bus drivers shone a harsh light on this reality.” Moore and Sutton also said many drivers have to run as many as six routes a day without receiving extra compensation. They said most school staffers are in the same situation. The system also told parents that bus service for Monday is uncertain and asked families to plan for that possibility.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday called a fall special session to deal with a limited agenda that includes legislative redistricting and the approval of a spending plan for federal coronavirus relief aid. The Nov. 8 special session approved by the governor through an executive order has no time restriction and may last indefinitely, though legislative leaders said they hoped it would only last five days. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and GOP House Majority Leader Chet Pollert have been meeting with Burgum in recent weeks to discuss the possibility of a special session. They joined the governor at the Capitol in announcing the special session Friday. The North Dakota Constitution limits the Legislature to 80 days of meetings every two years, and last spring’s regular session used 76 days. That means if the GOP-led Legislature had called itself back into session, lawmakers would have had to shoehorn the redistricting job, pandemic spending and other proposed legislation into just four days. Each of those subjects would take a minimum of three legislative days to be approved by both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP leaders said all of the Legislature’s pending business could have been accomplished during a reconvened session, though they preferred the special session.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two Republican appointees to the Ohio State Board of Education resigned Friday, about two weeks after they opposed its decision to rescind an anti-racism resolution passed last summer. Board President Laura Kohler, of New Albany, told reporters that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine requested her resignation and that Republicans in the state Senate who didn’t like the resolution would’ve had enough votes to remove her if she didn’t step down. The resolution, passed by the board last summer after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, condemned racism and included an acknowledgment that “the path to equity begins with a deep understanding of the history of inequalities and inhumanity.” It talked about training board members and Department of Education employees to identify their own biases and recommended that districts reexamine areas such as curriculum and discipline strategies. In their resignation letters to DeWine, Kohler and board member Eric Poklar, of Worthington, didn’t specifically mention the anti-racism resolution or related controversy. Kohler told the governor she felt resigning was how she could “best support you and your work at this time.” Poklar wrote that his “time on the board has ended” and that he was ready to pass responsibilities to the next person.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: While medical experts say it’s unclear why a condemned inmate began convulsing and vomiting after the first of three drugs used to execute him was administered Thursday, all agree the dosage was massive compared with what’s standard in surgeries, with one doctor calling it “insane.” The state’s prisons agency is now likely to face new litigation, which may focus on the state’s description of the execution of John Marion Grant for the 1998 slaying of a prison cafeteria worker as “in accordance with” protocols. Grant, 60, convulsed and vomited after the sedative midazolam was administered. That drug was followed by two more: vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Thursday’s lethal injection ended a six-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma that was brought on by concerns over its execution methods, including prior use of midazolam. Oklahoma’s protocols call for administering 500 milligrams of the sedative. Arkansas and Ohio are among other states that use that dose of midazolam in executions. “It’s just an insane dose, and there’s probably no data on what that could cause,” said Jonathan Groner, an Ohio State University medical school surgery professor and lethal injection expert. He added that sedation does not increase as the dosage goes up. “There’s a reason these drugs are given by anesthesiologists and not prison guards,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s “badly damaged” reputation – marked by months of destructive protests, a homelessness crisis and record year of homicides – is hurting its standing, according to its main tourism promoter. Travel Portland, the tourism promotion group partly funded by taxes, presented data to the City Council and mayor last week showing the city has declined to its “lowest level” of being a likely destination for delegates to attend conferences. Just 64% of surveyed tourists said they would visit Portland again. “There’s an old old saying, ‘It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and you can ruin it in an instant.’ That’s true of cities, as it is people,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said in response to the Travel Portland data. “And we’re just going to have to commit to that long-term process of improving the safety and the livability and the economic prosperity of the city.” The liberal city had long been known nationally for its ambrosial food scene, craft breweries and nature-loving hipsters. But last year, it became the epicenter of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. For months, a small downtown area was consumed by protests that often turned violent, with clashes between demonstrators and federal agents, plumes of tear gas, fireworks exploding in the streets and rubber bullets flying through the air. While Portland’s violent protests have largely eased, there are still outbreaks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Members of the city’s largest transit workers union reached a tentative contract agreement early Friday, averting a possible strike that threatened to bring elevated trains, buses and trolleys to a halt and leave thousands of children and educators without a way to get to school this week. The existing contract between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the 5,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 234 was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The tentative agreement announced by the union includes a two-year contract with a pay increase, a pandemic payment and parental leave for workers. “Our members are essential workers who move Philadelphia and who have risked their lives putting their own families at risk during this pandemic,” Willie Brown, Local 234 president, said in a statement praising Friday’s agreement. Members are scheduled to vote to ratify the contract next Friday. The union had voted Oct. 24 to authorize a worker walkout if an agreement couldn’t be reached. The union represents bus, trolley and elevated train operators, as well as mechanics and other staff. Union leadership had asked for a four-year contract with annual wage increases and a pandemic payment to compensate SEPTA workers who had served on the front lines of the pandemic, keeping public transportation moving for other essential workers. Nearly 800 members contracted COVID-19, and 11 TWU members died from COVID-19 or related complications, union leaders said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Students from the state are asking a federal appeals court to affirm that all public school students have a constitutional right to a civics education, saying that they aren’t taught how to meaningfully participate in a democratic and civil society and that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a symptom of such ignorance. Students nationwide need to know how to participate in the political process, effectively exercise their constitutional rights, and learn skills like media literacy to distinguish accurate from false information, their lawyers argue. The plaintiffs have asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston, to reverse a lower court’s dismissal of the case, declare there’s a constitutional right to an adequate civics education, and send the case back to district court. Such a judicial declaration is urgently needed, their brief to the court argues, in light of the events of Jan. 6 that were carried out by “a mob motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the congressional role in counting electoral votes.” Oral arguments will be heard Monday. The defendants include Rhode Island’s governor, education commissioner, and other education authorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJenkinsville: An area near the town has been hit with multiple minor earthquakes over the past week, including the latest one Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey initially registered the early Sunday morning earthquake in Fairfield County at 2.2 magnitude but later edged up the intensity to 2.3, multiple news outlets report. It’s the sixth small earthquake in the area over a week, with three quakes recorded Thursday alone. The State newspaper reports the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is studying the seismic activity. Earthquakes that register less than 2.5 usually are too small to be felt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Workers at a pork processing plant that was overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic say the company is no longer working in good faith. A spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers local union said the workers are “fed up” with injustices at their facilities after being on the front lines of the pandemic at the Smithfield plant for nearly two years. Local union president B.J. Motley said in a Friday release that the company is speeding up lines of production, verbally abusing employees, and neglecting social distancing and sanitary measures. “In consequence, we are seeing a record number of quits, injuries, grievances and overall unhappiness,” Motley said. “Our workers are tired, and their families are being affected by the heartlessness of the situation.” Jim Monroe, vice president of corporate affair for Smithfield, said in a statement that it’s the first time they have heard those concerns and that they disagree with the “portrayal of conditions” at the facility. The complaints come four months after the union agreed to a contract with Smithfield, which increased base pay, provided a bonus, and offered options of one to three weeks of leaves of absence and 15-minute breaks for employees working eight-hour shifts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The GOP-controlled General Assembly has signed off on a number of measures undercutting COVID-19 protections, while also begrudgingly backing off on threats to revoke businesses’ ability to enforce mask mandates. Lawmakers approved the slate of bills early Saturday while most Tennesseans were asleep, marking the second time the Legislature has recently advanced significant legislation in the middle of the night. Democratic lawmakers quickly criticized that their Republican lawmakers were willing to concede to concerns raised by influential businesses lobbyists but not those pointed out by school and health officials alarmed at other measures that advanced during the three-day special legislative session. On Friday, Gov. Bill Lee’s office confirmed Ford Motor Co. and other manufacturers had expressed concerns with several of the proposals being discussed during the special session. Lee had declined lawmakers’ requests to call a special session to address the coronavirus, forcing them to collect enough signatures to call the session without the governor. By Saturday, Lee thanked Republicans for taking up certain issues but held off from promising he would sign all of the bills into law.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Marcos: Local police officials refused to provide an escort for a Joe Biden campaign bus when it was surrounded by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on an interstate, an amended lawsuit filed over the 2020 encounter alleges. The updated lawsuit, filed Friday, included transcribed 911 audio recordings, The Texas Tribune reports. The suit alleges that law enforcement officers in San Marcos “privately laughed” and “joked about the victims and their distress” in the audio recordings. The city of San Marcos didn’t return a request for comment from the newspaper. A spokesperson previously said the city and the San Marcos Police Department would not comment because of the pending litigation. Videos shared on social media from Oct. 30, 2020, show a group of cars and pickup trucks – many adorned with large Trump flags – riding alongside the campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin. The “Trump Train” at times boxed in the bus. At one point, one of the pickups collided with an SUV behind the bus. According to the transcriptions, a 911 dispatcher told one bus passenger to call back if the caller felt threatened. “Are you kidding me, ma’am?” the caller replied. “They’ve cut in on me multiple times. They’ve threatened my life on multiple occasions with vehicular collision.”\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: Zion National Park officials and national conservation leaders met at the Utah Outdoor Recreation Summit on Thursday to hold the first public engagement meeting for a new recreation management plan. The five-person panel discussed the East Zion Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project to develop the east side of the park in order to disperse visitors and protect the “last unprotected gateway to a national park in the continental United States.” “The regional recreational management planning process is not just a thing: It is a spirit, it is a community effort, and it needs to remain such if it’s to be successful,” said Kevin McLaws, the owner of Zion Mountain Ranch and of the land granted for the East Zion Initiative. During the summit, titled “Crafting a Community-Led Vision for Regional Recreation Management in Greater Zion,” leaders and attendees discussed “solutions to trip planning, visitor experience, dispersal, mobility, and economic opportunity” that the region faces, the summit’s website said. As Zion is the third-most-visited national park in the county, seeing over 4 million visitors per year, the park and nearby gateway communities have seen record-high visitation since last fall, putting strain on amenities, the environment, businesses, park staff and locals and causing crowding.\n\nVermont\n\nFairfax: Some school districts are using electric school buses this fall as part of a pilot project to test their effectiveness. Gov. Phil Scott and education leaders celebrated the introduction of four electric buses in Fairfax on Thursday, with more expected to arrive this month. The buses also being used by the Champlain Valley School District and the Barre Unified Union District will start using them this month. “We are beyond excited to add electric buses to our fleet,” said Justin Brown, middle school principal at Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax. “We all hope this paves the way for more ‘green’ transportation in our – and our kids’ – future.” The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately save school districts money, officials said. An emissions settlement with Volkswagen is funding most of the project. The school districts each get two buses. Bus driver Patsy Parker said the electric buses are quieter than diesel models, which she believes makes her young passengers quieter, too. The buses’ battery range has forced schools to reconsider some routes, particularly during cold weather, school officials said. “Where we would normally be able to go 120 miles a day, we’re limiting more to 60 or 70 miles a day because of the cold weather. But that’s what this pilot program is about,” Parker said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The anti-Donald Trump group The Lincoln Project took credit Friday for five people appearing with tiki torches at a campaign stop by the GOP candidate for governor – a stunt recalling white supremacists who descended on the city amid violence in 2017. Charlottesville TV station WVIR reports candidate Glenn Youngkin was inside a restaurant when the group dressed in matching hats, khakis and white button-down shirts appeared beside his campaign bus. The former private equity executive and political newcomer is in a close race against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe as Tuesday’s Election Day nears. Photos showed the group holding large tiki torches. Their appearance recalled two days of chaos in 2017, when white supremacists gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally ostensibly to protest the planned removal of a Confederate monument. The night before the planned rally, a group carrying tiki torches marched across the University of Virginia campus, clashing with a small group of anti-racist protesters. The next day, a car driven by a self-avowed white supremacist plowed into a crowd of peaceful counterprotesters, killing one and injuring dozens. McAuliffe staffers promoted a reporter’s tweet about the group’s appearance, using it to attack Youngkin and suggesting that those holding the torches were his supporters. Youngkin staffers then accused the McAuliffe campaign or Virginia Democrats of being involved, drawing disavowals from McAuliffe’s campaign.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: After more than 18 months of pandemic-driven eviction limits, Gov. Jay Inslee said he would allow the latest version of the state’s eviction moratorium to expire Sunday. The move opens the door for an influx of new eviction cases and tests key tenant protections for the first time since the pandemic upended the legal process last year. “We have to have some end to the moratorium. You can’t have an economy ultimately where just nobody pays rent,” Inslee said at a press conference last week, the Seattle Times reports. Soon after the coronavirus hit, Inslee used his emergency powers to halt most evictions. This fall, Inslee loosened the rules. He replaced the moratorium with a “bridge” proclamation that still stopped some evictions for nonpayment of rent in certain parts of the state but allowed evictions for other reasons. The expiration of that policy Sunday means landlords can seek more evictions of tenants who fell behind on rent during the pandemic, provided owners go through newly required steps such as offering the tenant a payment plan. Most evictions will still be halted in Seattle, Burien and Kenmore, where local lawmakers have passed their own eviction moratoriums to last through early 2022.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKenova: When COVID-19 vaccines first became available, Ric Griffith’s family-owned drugstore was among 250 mom-and-pop pharmacies that helped the state get off to the nation’s fastest start in vaccinating its residents. Republican Gov. Jim Justice went on national news shows to declare West Virginia – a place that regularly ranks near the bottom in many health indicators – “the diamond in the rough.” Nine months later, those days are a distant memory. Demand for the vaccine has almost dried up, the question of whether to get a shot has become a political hot button, and West Virginia’s vaccination rate has plummeted to the lowest among the states. The governor, who spent months preaching the virtues of the vaccine to reluctant West Virginians, is still doing that but also promoting a new law that would allow some exemptions to employer-imposed vaccination requirements. And shots are mostly sitting on shelves. “I’m afraid that while taking a victory lap, we discovered that there were more laps to go in the race,” Griffith, who is also a Democratic member of the state House of Delegates, said Monday of West Virginia’s descent from first to worst. Griffith said he was proud of Justice’s nonstop effort to push vaccines “and the obvious love he has for the people of West Virginia.” But Justice also ended a statewide indoor mask mandate in June and has opposed vaccination and mask requirements since.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has declined to issue a ruling on a preliminary injunction requested by Ojibwe tribes to stop the state’s 2021 wolf hunt. But Chief U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson said Friday that he had “deep misgivings” about state rules that proved inadequate in February to keep the wolf kill to the intended target. The case is part of a lawsuit filed Sept. 21 by six Wisconsin Ojibwe tribes against the Department of Natural Resources and Natural Resources Board. The tribes argue that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Wisconsin wolf hunting and trapping season in February resulted in a kill of 218 wolves, 99 wolves above the state-licensed quota. The shares had been split 119 for the state and 81 for the tribes. The take by state-licensed hunters and trappers effectively consumed the tribes’ quota. The tribes are represented by the California-based environmental group Earthjustice. The case took an unusual turn due to a preliminary injunction on the wolf season handed out Oct. 22 in a similar case by a Dane County judge. With the season already effectively blocked, Peterson said he wasn’t able to issue relief. But he heard arguments and testimony over seven hours Friday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State senators on Friday voted down the last special legislative session bill they had written to counter President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccinations – one that would have prohibited discrimination against business customers and others based on their vaccination status. The special session that began Tuesday in response to the federal plans will continue Monday, however, when senators plan to take up a House bill to bar employers from considering vaccination status in hiring decisions. The measure cleared the House 38-20 on Friday. The Senate will also consider a bill that would give Gov. Mark Gordon’s office $1 million to fight the Biden administration vaccine requirements for certain federal, health care and other private-sector employees and to prohibit enforcement of the requirements in Wyoming. That bill passed the House 41-14 on Friday. With no more legislation related to COVID-19 immediately left to consider, the House adjourned until Wednesday. Lawmakers worried that prohibiting discrimination based on a person’s vaccination status would have unforeseen and unintended consequences for businesses. The bill would open the way for “still more ways to sue” businesses, said Sen. Dave Kinskey, R-Sheridan, calling it “a lawyer’s field day.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/28/underwater-art-tomato-fight-lawn-mower-racing-news-around-states/39520639/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state House of Representatives has passed legislation allowing residents to purchase wine and have it shipped directly to their house. The bill by Republican Rep. Terri Collins would allow licensed wine manufacturers to obtain a permit to deliver limited quantities of wine directly to Alabamians. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board doesn’t allow such shipments now. The bill passed 77-11 and now heads to the Senate. Democratic Rep. Thomas Jackson jokingly shouted during Thursday’s debate, “What’s wrong with the wine we got now?” – a reference to former Rep. Alvin Holmes, who famously asked in a 2008 debate about allowing stronger beer: “What’s wrong with the beer we got? I mean the beer we got drank pretty good, don’t it?”\n\nAlaska\n\nAkiak: The community has quickly lost entire buildings due to erosion along the banks of its river, officials say. Residents of this southwest Alaska town awoke last week to find that smokehouses built along the Kuskokwim River had fallen into the water along with stretches of the riverbank, KYUK-AM reports. The community 42 miles northeast of Bethel lost between 75 and 100 feet of the riverbank, according to Akiak City Administrator David Gilila. “That’s just in one day; that’s just in a matter of hours,” Gilila says. Akiak has experienced erosion problems before but now faces damage to about a mile of riverbank. “There’s no comparison to it,” Gilila says. “Before, it was just certain spots. Today, it’s the whole bank from the upper end of Akiak to the lower end of it.” Houses now face possible destruction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican-led Legislature has proved receptive in recent years to certain proposals offered up by teenagers, passing laws to designate lemonade as the state drink and copper as the state metal. But some students who went to the Capitol this year say they got a different type of reception – if they got one at all – when they tried to pitch proposals on meatier public-policy topics. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that those topics include gun control, school safety and climate change. While GOP legislators said refusing to sponsor progressive bills doesn’t amount to disrespect, some teenage policy advocates said some lawmakers were condescending at times but gushed about the civic involvement of young people who pushed innocuous bills sponsored by Republicans.\n\nArkansas\n\nHope: The publisher of the largest newspaper in the state has said by the end of the year, the publication will no longer print or deliver daily editions and will instead distribute iPads for subscribers to access a daily digital replica. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette will still print a Sunday edition but will urge subscribers to convert to the daily digital replica, accessible via the newspaper’s app. The newspaper’s publisher, Walter Hussman, has said that if 70% of subscribers convert to the digital version, the paper will be profitable for the first time since 2017. Some subscribers who converted say they prefer the digital paper, which can be enlarged and which is easily transportable. But it remains to be seen if the program will also appeal to younger generations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Massive crowds are expected at Disneyland when its Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge land opens this week, but park officials have a plan to manage them – and it involves Stormtroopers. Park employees dressed as the white-armored foot soldiers may be used to encourage guests to “move along” to other parts of the theme park if they’ve overstayed a four-hour limit inside Galaxy’s Edge. The time limit will be in place from the area’s opening Friday until June 23. Reservations and a special wristband are required to visit the area at the Anaheim theme park for the first three weeks. Galaxy’s Edge is the largest single-theme land created inside a Disney park. The 14-acre land’s marquee attraction is a ride inside a replica of the Millennium Falcon.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: The state has a new law on the books that legislators say expands protections for mobile home residents and leads to better enforcement of those regulations. The Daily Camera reports Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law Thursday that sets up a resolution process for disputes between mobile home residents and park owners. The law allows the state Division of Housing to accept complaints and begin the mediation process. The law also gives residents 30 days to leave properties when evicted, instead of the previous 48 hours. Democratic state Rep. Edie Hooton says the state will likely see a spike in complaints during the law’s first year, but lawmakers expect the volume to subside as “park owners start to see that the rules are being enforced.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: Police are still searching for a fugitive who failed to honor an agreement and surrender once enough people responded to his wanted poster on social media. Jose Simms is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. He is believed to be in New York state. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page last week that Simms had contacted him through the site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster received 15,000 likes. The page has far surpassed that number, but still no sign of Simms. Maki Haberfeld, an expert in police ethics and procedure at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says Simms is using social media to manipulate the news media and police, who she said have no business negotiating a deal with a suspect, never mind one that involves likes on Facebook.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A church has been badly damaged by a fire, though no injuries have been reported. The blaze engulfed Saint Mary’s Holy Church near Georgetown on Sunday. State investigators are trying to determine the cause of the destructive blaze. Delaware’s office of the state fire marshal says the “heavy damage” at the church was estimated at $50,000. The Georgetown Fire Company responded to the early Sunday blaze. It was first reported shortly after midnight.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory welcomed parishioners to his first Sunday Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Matthew the Apostle over the weekend, WUSA-TV reports. D.C.’s newest archbishop officially took possession of the cathedral during the Mass, welcomed by Monsignor Ronald James in a celebration of the beginning of the new ministry. Gregory expressed his joy, saying, “We are beginning something new – a new friendship and relationship that we pray will be fruitful and filled with joy.” He then asked the parishioners for their faith and prayers. Following the Mass, Gregory introduced himself, shaking hands and talking with the Catholic parishioners he will serve in his new position. He was formally installed last Tuesday as the first African American leader of the district’s Catholic community.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Divers off the state’s far southern coast can now visit an underwater art museum. Divers finished placing a series of artworks on a sunken ship Saturday about 7 miles south of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The project consists of 24 large photo illustrations created by Austrian artist Andreas Franke. They were placed on the Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a former U.S. Air Force missile tracking ship that was intentionally sunk 10 years ago to create an artificial reef. Franke calls it the “Plastic Ocean Project” and says he wants it to draw attention to the need to eliminate plastics in the world’s oceans. On Monday, divers unfurled a giant American flag on the 523-foot long ship to commemorate Memorial Day and the 10th anniversary of the ship’s sinking.\n\nGeorgia\n\nValdosta: A civil rights activist is clashing with the mayor over a proposal to rename a street for former President Barack Obama. The Valdosta Daily Times reports police escorted the Rev. Floyd Rose, 80, from a city council meeting Thursday after Mayor John Gayle said he kept talking beyond his public comment time. Rose wants Forrest Street renamed to honor the nation’s first black president. He says it was named in 1883 for Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Ku Klux Klan leader. Gayle said petitioners need to follow a new ordinance, but Rose said it was designed to thwart the name change. It says only one signature can come from each parcel along a road, so multiple signatures from a single apartment complex don’t count.\n\nHawaii\n\nKeauhou: Federal officials are in the final review stages for rules that would ban swimming with Hawaiian spinner dolphins. West Hawaii Today reported last week that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials are nearing completion of regulations proposed almost three years ago that would create a 50-yard barrier around the mammals. Officials say the rules would outlaw coming within the protected area around Hawaiian spinner dolphins – or “naia” in the Hawaiian language – by any means including swimming or using a boat to intercept the animal’s path. The prohibition would cover all persons, vessels and objects and extend 2 nautical miles from island coastlines, including waters bounded by Maui, Lanai and Kahoolawe. The regulations would include exceptions such as dolphins approaching swimmers and boats and safe navigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nMeridian: Federal data shows the state’s largest cities have grown larger, with a second city now seeing its population topping 100,000 residents. The Post Register reports new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau show the most dramatic growth was in this city neighboring the capital, Boise. Meridian’s population has jumped nearly 39% since 2010, with a population estimated at nearly 107,000. The data indicates Meridian grew the seventh fastest of the major cities across the country. Meridian is now second to Boise, which recorded a population of nearly 229,000 residents last year. Behind Meridian is Nampa with 96,000 people and Idaho Falls with 61,000.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers has sent Congress a $778 million plan to fortify a waterway in the state with noisemakers, electric cables and other devices in the hope that they will prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, where the aggressive invaders could leave other fish with too little to eat. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite on Thursday approved the plan to install defenses at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam near Joliet, about 40 miles from Lake Michigan. The site is a crucial choke point in an aquatic pathway between the lake and the carp-infested Illinois River. Although only a few live Asian carp have been found past the barrier, the fish’s DNA has turned up there as recently as April, when water samples were taken from Chicago’s Lake Calumet.\n\nIndiana\n\nClarksville: A former Colgate-Palmolive factory could become the home of a hotel, housing and commercial space. The factory in this Ohio River town in southern Indiana made toothpaste and other personal hygiene products for decades until it closed in 2007. A plan recently approved by Clarksville officials and the Clark’s Landing development group calls for redeveloping the building, which is known for its large, iconic clock. Clarksville redevelopment director Dylan Fisher tells the News and Tribune the project is expected to include a hotel, multifamily housing, commercial space and a civic center. That proposal is part of a redevelopment planned for Clarksville’s south side. It will have elevated bike trails, a revamped riverfront area, and a mix of businesses, residential spaces and community spaces.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has vetoed a bill that would have lifted a cap on the potency of medical marijuana products available in the state. Reynolds vetoed the bill Friday afternoon, saying the state must proceed cautiously in any expansion of its medical marijuana program. Reynolds says she could support in the future a more limited effort to increase the potency of products. Democratic lawmakers who have supported expansion of the program criticized Reynolds’ decision, saying it would hurt sick people who get little benefit from products now available that have low levels of THC, the compound that causes a high. Rep. John Forbes, an Urbandale pharmacist, called the veto “distressing news for thousands of sick and vulnerable Iowans who deserve greater access to this life-changing medication.” The bill had been approved overwhelmingly in both legislative chambers.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Restored mission control consoles used by NASA to guide trips to the moon will soon be shipped from the state to the control room where they were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. The Hutchinson News reports that Cosmosphere’s SpaceWorks experts have restored 19 consoles in Hutchinson over the past year and a half. NASA picked up 10 of the consoles last year, and the remainder will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday. The consoles, which will be unveiled in June ahead of the 50-year anniversary celebration of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon, were used for the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. They also helped communicate with astronauts to fix an oxygen tank that exploded on Apollo 13.\n\nKentucky\n\nWilliamstown: In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of the Noah’s ark attraction in the state are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1million in property damage. The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The attraction’s insurance carriers refused to cover the damage. The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged. The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers. Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn’t responded in court filings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMetairie: A young bald eagle found soaked and stumping along a street in the neighborhood where it hatched will be released Tuesday in the same area. A resident brought the mottled brown eaglet to the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine’s Wildlife Hospital on May 11, after making sure it needed help. Another neighbor has been collecting money for its care and posting health updates outside her home. Coastal consultant and photographer P.J. Hahn says it was on the ground, barely able to fly, and appeared to have a wing injury. Veterinary school spokeswoman Ginger Guttner says the eagle needed supportive care and has been in the school’s flight cage since May 20 so veterinarians could be sure it flies well enough to be released.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: Local Memorial Day celebrations have noted the absence of a particularly prominent veteran who died last year. The American Legion had two empty chairs in Kennebunkport’s Dock Square on Monday in memory of all of the times former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched the Memorial Day parade from that spot. Mark Matthews from American Legion Post 159 said organizers wanted to acknowledge the absence of Bush, a longtime summer resident and a Navy veteran. He missed last year’s parade after falling ill after attending an American Legion pancake breakfast earlier in the weekend. He died at age 94 on Nov. 30, months after his wife’s death. Town Manager Laurie Smith said the Bushes’ absence is felt every day. She said it will be a “strange” summer without their presence.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: To Marylanders, Old Bay is more than a seasoning – it’s a symbol of state pride. The yellow and blue tin with a red lid is tattooed on calves or placed in windowsills along with a crab and decorative mallets. A T-shirt proclaims: “I put Old Bay on my Old Bay.” Eighty-three percent of the state’s residents reported a favorable opinion of Old Bay, according to The Goucher Poll, a political survey of 808 adults. Yet the seasoning’s popularity belies a little-known truth: Cooks in restaurants and crab shacks rarely use Old Bay to steam crabs. The Baltimore Sun called dozens of crab houses in the region, and the majority – 18 out of 30 – said they steam crabs with either J.O. No. 2 seasoning or a custom blend made by the Halethorpe-based spice company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities say a group of Jewish teens played a key role in saving the life of a drowning man with a tattoo of a swastika. NBC Boston reports it happened Thursday night as the four youths – all students at an Orthodox Jewish high school in suburban Brookline – spotted the body of a man partially submerged in Chestnut Hill Reservoir. Boston College police officer Carl Mascioli says two of the teens ran to his patrol car to alert him. Mascioli says he rushed down the embankment, pulled the man from the water and noticed the Nazi symbol tattooed on his hand. He says the unidentified students told him they don’t regret helping the man despite his anti-Semitic tattoo. Officials say the man is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Pvt. James Robinson played an important role in the final battle of the Revolutionary War, but like many African Americans who took up arms against the British, he received little lasting recognition. That’s about to change. Members of two patriotic lineage societies linked to historic wars are planning to unveil a special grave marker and give Robinson, who died in 1868, military funeral honors during a ceremony next month at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. “Over 5,000 African Americans served in the Revolutionary War, and Robinson is one of the most consequential figures of the period,” said Elijah Shalis, secretary of the Michigan Society Sons of the American Revolution. “He deserved this honor 151 years ago.” Robinson led a remarkable life. He was a slave and a minister who fought in two wars and died at age 115 as the last known living African American veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCook: A woman in northern Minnesota has donated a kidney to a volunteer firefighter who was the first responder when she and her child needed help. KARE-TV reports that their paths first crossed in 2016 when Becca Bundy’s 1-year-old daughter was having a seizure. She dialed 911, and Bearville volunteer firefighter Bill Cox was the first on the scene. Last fall, Bundy came across Cox tending bar and wearing a T-shirt that said he was in end-stage kidney failure and needed a donor. Bundy was a match, and the transplant took place in February. The 66-year-old Cox, who is now free from dialysis, says Bundy is his angel. She says she feels blessed to be on his journey with him.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a state law that would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, at about six weeks of pregnancy. “Here we go again,” U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves wrote in his order. “Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.” His new order stops the law from taking effect July 1. Reeves is the same judge who struck down a 2018 Mississippi law to ban abortion at 15 weeks. The Magnolia State is one of several states that have pushed this year to enact bans on early abortions. Opponents of abortion are emboldened by new conservative Supreme Court justices and are looking for ways to challenge the court’s 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state has become the 20th to join a nationwide sex offender registry. OffenderWatch said in a news release last week that every Missouri law enforcement agency that manages or investigates registered sex offenders will be able to collaborate on offender records, aid each other in investigations and share notifications with the public. It won a five-year contract from the Missouri Highway Patrol. Missouri has about 16,000 registered sex offenders. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children says there are more than 900,000 registered sex offenders in the United States. OffenderWatch says its service allows different law enforcement agencies to collaborate on a single offender record, improving accuracy and aiding in public safety. Its technology is used by more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies in 37 states.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state will install a permanent monument on the Capitol grounds recognizing Native American contributions to the state and nation. Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday held a ceremonial signing of legislation to erect a monument and display the flags of the state’s eight recognized Native American tribes. The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Marvin Weatherwax of Browning, called it a big honor and “well overdue.” Bullock says the monument will be a symbol of respect and understanding, as well as a recognition that the Capitol belongs to everybody. The measure was part of a package of bills Bullock signed dealing with Native American issues, including legislation meant to improve the response to reports of missing American Indian women.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: It’s not very often you get to touch a dinosaur. But that’s just one of the many cool things about the newly renovated Schramm Education Center at Schramm Park State Recreation Area near Gretna, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The pallid sturgeon touch tank lets kids feel the unique fish, which outdoor education specialist Amber Schiltz says is like a living dinosaur. That fish family has been around for 70 million years. School kids who recently visited loved to touch the bony plates of sturgeon when a curious one swam up to their hands. “They were squealing and getting excited,” Schiltz told the paper. “It was really fun.” The center will soon hold its grand opening after an almost two-year renovation that cost several million dollars, much of it funded by donors. The building, previously called Aksarben Aquarium, was gutted and expanded by about a third.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe’s clarity rebounded last year from its worst level in a half-century of record-keeping as weather and streamflow returned to more normal conditions. Scientists at the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center say the dinner plate-sized disc used to measure clarity was visible at an average depth of 70.9 feet in 2018. That’s 10.5 feet better than the year before. The new clarity measurement is in line with the five-year average of 70.3 feet, which is an increase of nearly a foot from the previous five-year running average at the alpine lake that straddles the California-Nevada line. Scientists hope efforts to combat threats to lake clarity posed by development and climate change will eventually return the lake to its historic clarity level in excess of 100 feet.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIsles of Shoals: The state has had an artist in residence at the White Mountain National Forest for years. Now it will have one at an island off its coast. The nonprofit Star Island Corporation is launching a weeklong Artist-in-Residence program. Star Island is one of a group of small islands among the Isles of Shoals, an hour’s boat ride from the New Hampshire and Maine coasts. A formal application process is being worked on for the program for next summer. For centuries, the Shoals have attracted artists drawn to the rugged beauty of the islands. The residency will require artists to share their time and talent with conference guests, day visitors and staff of Star Island. Exhibit space for artwork will be provided in the lobby of the 19th-century Oceanic Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Deptford: The largest U.S. seller of San Marzano tomatoes, known to food lovers as the best tomatoes to make pasta sauce, has been hit with two federal lawsuits claiming what’s inside the can isn’t the real thing. New Jersey-based Cento Fine Foods called the claims “wrongful” last week and assured the company’s tomatoes are true San Marzanos, meaning they were grown at the base of Mount Vesuvius in Campania in Italy. One suit filed in February alleges fraud, saying there’s no way Cento can produce that many San Marzano tomatoes. Another suit says the cans lack certain labeling that qualifies them as true San Marzanos. The company says that isn’t a requirement. San Marzano tomatoes are a favorite among foodies for their sweet flavor, stronger taste and low acidity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: John Pinto, a Navajo Code Talker in World War II who became one of the nation’s longest-serving Native American elected officials, has died at age 94. State Senate colleague Michael Padilla confirmed Pinto’s death in Gallup on Friday after years of suffering from various illnesses that rarely kept him from his duties. After serving as a Marine, Pinto was selected to the New Mexico Senate in 1976 and represented a district that included the Navajo Nation for more than four decades. The region is one of the poorest in the country. Born on the Navajo Nation to a family of sheep herders, Pinto didn’t start formal schooling until he was nearly a teenager. “At the age of 12, I was in kindergarten,” Pinto told the Albuquerque Journal in a 2007 interview. “I guess I did all right.”\n\nNew York\n\nCobleskill: The State University of New York at Cobleskill is launching a new four-year program in “canine training and management” amid a surge in demand for specially trained dogs to detect threats and assist veterans in the wake of 9/11. While several institutions hand out training certificates, and at least one small private college awards a bachelor’s in dog handling, the program at Cobleskill is more ambitious in its scope. Professor Stephen Mackenzie says he developed Cobleskill’s Bachelor of Technology degree partly in response to a heightened demand for dogs capable of sniffing out explosives in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The need for service dogs trained to assist those with post-traumatic stress disorder or reduced mobility has also expanded as veterans started returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: As the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches, historians and educators worry that the World War II milestone is losing its resonance with today’s students. In North Carolina as in many other states, D-Day isn’t part of the required curriculum, though some teachers do use the anniversary to spend extra time on the June 6, 1944, battle. It’s not a stand-alone topic in France, which was liberated from German occupation. German schools concentrate on the Holocaust and Nazi dictatorship. Schools in Russia avoid D-Day because they believe the victories on the Eastern Front won the war. In Cary, North Carolina, Kasey Turcol taught her students at Crossroads FLEX High School about D-Day, including lesser-known aspects like tales of a Spanish spy.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group raising awareness about post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide among combat veterans has finished a 400-mile walk. Brady’s Border2Border Ruck March began on the state’s western border Tuesday and concluded Saturday in Fargo. The event honors Brady Oberg, who served in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. After coming home, Oberg suffered from PTSD and killed himself in 2015. KFGO- AM reports that a group of 16 family and friends participated in the march. They each carried a bag with 20 pounds to represent the 20 veterans with PTSD who take their lives every day. The first march took place a year ago. Oberg’s family started the Brady Oberg Legacy Foundation to raise awareness of PTSD.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city is working to preserve the heritage of century-old trees planted to commemorate area soldiers who died in World War I. The planting of the 9-mile stretch of red oaks that runs through Cleveland and into suburban Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights marked its 100th anniversary on Memorial Day. Local officials are taking an inventory of remaining Liberty Row trees, many of which have died over the years, with some plaques lost or damaged. The greater Cleveland area was one of the first communities nationally to envision a multi-mile stretch of trees as a memorial to fallen soldiers. Between 1919 and 1924, more than 800 oak trees were planted, each with a bronze plaque at its base engraved with the name of a fallen soldier.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the state’s largest-ever appropriations bill, an $8.1 billion spending plan that funds pay raises for teachers and state workers and pumps tens of millions more dollars into public schools. Flanked by Republican legislative leaders, the first-year governor signed the bill Friday, a day after the Legislature adjourned the 2019 session. The deal also socks away an additional $200 million into a state savings account. When combined with additional revenue in the state’s Rainy Day Fund, the savings will give the state more than $1 billion in reserve funds. Democrats criticized the plan as not doing enough for working-class Oklahomans and argued the additional $200 million was needed to shore up previous cuts to core services.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge on Friday ordered a man to learn about the Sikh religion and submit a report to the court as part of his sentence for an attack on a Sikh shopkeeper in Salem, a civil rights group said. Andrew Ramsey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of intimidation and assault in the Jan. 14 incident targeting Harwinder Singh Dodd, according to a release from the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S. The intimidation count is considered a hate crime, the group said. Witnesses said Ramsey pulled on Dodd’s beard after he refused to sell him cigarettes without an ID, punched him and pulled him to the ground. Bystanders restrained Ramsey until police arrived. Dodd, who came to the U.S. from India and owns the convenience store, noted in a written statement to the court that hate crimes are on the rise in America. The FBI says hate crimes increased by 40% in Oregon from 2016 to 2017.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Weather officials say the state has already recorded the average number of tornadoes for a year even before the summer period in which severe weather is most common. Meteorologist Sarah Johnson of the National Weather Service says 16 tornadoes – the yearly average – have had preliminary confirmation in the commonwealth so far this year. Severe weather is more common in June and into July, but that’s not a hard and fast rule. For example, Johnson says, a large outbreak of severe weather occurred Oct. 2 across Pennsylvania. In recent weeks, Johnson says, the high plains and Mid-Atlantic have been getting the brunt of low-pressure systems bringing precipitation. On Thursday, six tornado warnings were issued across the commonwealth in a span of just two hours.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The mansion once owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Edith Wharton is on the market for nearly $12 million. The Providence Journal reports that Land’s End in Newport, where Wharton and her husband lived in the late 19th century, is for sale at $11.7 million. It was more recently owned by socialite Marion Oates Charles, who died there in December. The 24-room mansion on a 5.6-acre estate was built in 1880. It’s located on a street that runs between two of the city’s most famous thoroughfares, Bellevue Avenue and the Cliff Walk. Kendra Toppa, the listing agent, said the property “truly epitomizes Newport real estate at its finest.” Wharton won the Pulitzer for 1920’s “The Age of Innocence” and also wrote “Ethan Frome” and “The House of Mirth.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city kicked off 17 days of operas, plays, chamber music and jazz Friday as the world-renowned Spoleto Festival USA returns. The 43rd season of the arts festival began with the opening ceremony from Charleston City Hall. It will run through June 9. The spotlighted performance is the opera “Salome.” Spoleto plans a contemporary retelling of the 1905 Richard Strauss opera, based on an Oscar Wilde play of the same name about the Biblical story of the woman who asked for the head of John the Baptist. The Spoleto Festival USA choir will join the festival’s orchestra and the Charleston Symphony for a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. John Passion on June 4. The festival will take place in 11 indoor and outdoor venues.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHoughton: An 88-year-old man has made his mark on this farming community as a prolific gopher killer. Clayton Sanderson of Houghton estimates he has caught 22,000 of the varmints since he started hunting them down in 1997. Sanderson told the Aberdeen News he doesn’t poison the animals because poison is expensive, and he can’t reach their bodies if they go deep into their gopher holes to die, making it harder for him to turn them into profit. So he widens the top of the hole and sets a trap with two pressure-triggered arms. He says he’s been bitten only once in 22 years. Farmers hate gophers, he said, “with a passion,” because of the damage wrought on their farm equipment when they hit the mounds at the entrance of the gopher holes. Sanderson said he earns $3 for every set of gopher front paws he hands over to Shelby or Lansing township officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nJasper: A University of Tennessee doctoral student is resurrecting research that was abandoned nearly 80 years ago that could be crucial for Tennessee Valley Authority’s understanding of long-term weather patterns that factor into the agency’s decisions regarding water. Scientist Florence Hawley began research in the 1930s studying tree rings to understand long-term weather patterns in the Norris Basin, The Times Free Press reports. She worked at TVA in its earliest days but faced sexism on the job and was never allowed to publish her results, according to TVA officials. She abandoned TVA in the 1940s and went to work in the Southwest. Her research was recently found in the TVA archives. The utility provider approached the University of Tennessee about finishing the work, and doctoral student Laura Smith has taken on the task.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The police chief has announced a youth jobs program meant to give children something to do during high-crime summer months and better connect officers to underserved areas. The Dallas Morning News reports Chief U. Renee Hall says the DPD to You(th) initiative will focus on students from schools with higher rates of crime and arrests. The project involves recruiting 50 students, from schools primarily in South Dallas, and inserting them in occupations with city government agencies, nonprofits and the Dallas Police Department. Volunteers will mentor the students in the program. Assistant City Manager Jon Fortune says the program “is critical as we look for ways to have a greater impact on the lives of teens.” Police officials also aim to host a citywide youth community service day.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah Lake: On a recent visit to Utah Lake’s west shore, Alison Green scrutinized sandstone outcrops, measuring lines chiseled into the stone by ancient hands, then doing her best to replicate them on gridded sheets. The 12-year-old from Sandy inspected one petroglyph cut into rock hundreds of years ago by Fremont Indians. “It shows the person has braided legs, and that could be a birthing scene,” she said. “That could mean it was a fertile area.” Green was among two dozen middle schoolers from Sandy’s Blessed Sacrament Catholic School recently doing archaeological surveys at the Adelbert Doyle Smith Family Preserve as part of an effort to list the 196-acre site on the National Register of Historic Places. “The kids are doing the work the way an entry-level archaeologist out of college would,” says John McHugh, a science teacher at Blessed Sacrament leading the expedition. He calls the school’s archaeology club the Shovel Bums, after the moniker given to rookie archaeologists who do the grunt work at excavation sites.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Seven historic sites owned by the state are now open for the season. The sites include more than 80 historic structures and hundreds of acres of forest and farmland that opened Saturday. State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann says the historic sites include prehistoric camps, Revolutionary War sites and the homes of U.S. presidents. She says they all shed light on the history of Vermont. Among the sites that opened include the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch, the Old Constitution House in Windsor and the Hubbardton Battlefield in Hubbardton. More than 70 public events and programs are scheduled this season at Vermont’s State Historic Sites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A new television series with Ethan Hawke starring as the fiery abolitionist John Brown is set to film in the state. Gov. Ralph Northam’s office announced Thursday that production of the eight-part series will start in central Virginia this summer. The show is based on the novel “The Good Lord Bird” by best-selling author James McBride and is set to air on Showtime. Brown led a raid in 1859 on a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, in what is now West Virginia, hoping to start an armed slave rebellion. The rebellion didn’t happen, and Brown was later hanged for treason. Before the raid, Brown and a group of abolitionist settlers killed five pro-slavery settlers in Kansas in the Pottawatomie massacre.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane Valley: Proponents of creating a 51st state have held a bake sale to raise money for their cause. The Spokesman-Review reports that supporters of the proposed Christian conservative state, which would span parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, raised money by auctioning pies and other desserts. The Liberty State Gala drew about 200 people in the city of Spokane Valley on Thursday evening. Speakers included Washington state Rep. Matt Shea, a Spokane Valley Republican who has championed the Liberty State movement. Shea spoke of the cultural and political differences between eastern and western Washington, denied the existence of global warming, and claimed the United States is “a Christian nation” under siege by atheists and Communists. Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagen and county Prosecutor Larry Haskell also attended.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republicans in the state Senate have pitched a broad-based education plan that allows for charter schools but doesn’t include vouchers. Senate President Mitch Carmichael released a lengthy draft of the proposal late Friday and said it’s a compromise that folds in many ideas backed by Democrats. “Nobody gets everything they want,” he said. The legislation includes a pay raise for teachers, mental health services for students and a provision that would withhold pay for teachers if a school is closed because of a strike. The proposal comes as the GOP-led legislature nears special session debate on education measures. Carmichael said he put out the draft of the bill Friday to give lawmakers time to read it so they can come back this week and propose changes before the Senate reconvenes. Republican Gov. Jim Justice issued a statement praising the bill.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFifield: Rock music blared from speakers as spectators watched speedsters zoom around a track Sunday afternoon. It was a big day for racing, with NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 and the Indy 500, but the races in this northern Wisconsin community featured machines a bit slower than Indy cars – lawn mowers. While all the vehicles must start their careers as actual riding lawn mowers, racers make a few adjustments, resulting in mowers that can travel as fast as 60 mph. At Sunday’s races, which were a fundraiser for the Fifield Fire Department, 30 mowers competed in five classes on a dirt track an eighth of a mile long. Blades are removed from racing lawn mowers and steel welded on the frame for stability. In some classes, machines must run on original lawn mower engines. All must have hydraulic brakes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Symphony Orchestra has named Christopher Dragon as its new conductor and music director after a search lasting a year and a half. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Casper orchestra announced Thursday the selection of the Australia-born conductor, who was one of four finalists for the job. Dragon programmed and performed a concert in January with the orchestra. Search committee chair Eric Unruh says Dragon was a hit with the audience and musicians, and his creativity and innovation stood out. Dragon has been an associate conductor with the Colorado Symphony for four years. He will be the Denver orchestra’s resident conductor for the next two years. Dragon says every concert in Casper next year will feature a Beethoven piece in honor of the 250th anniversary of the composer’s birth.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/shopper-news/2018/02/26/shopper-news-blog-02-26-brings-you-latest-happenings-your-community/372348002/", "title": "Shopper News blog: Webb player has winning connection — her mom", "text": "Shopper News\n\nWhat's new in your community?

Check back throughout the week.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nWebb player has winning connection — her mom\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWebb School junior Casey Collier had just been named the Division II-A East region basketball tournament MVP on Feb. 17 and was proudly discussing the team’s success when she was asked a question she was expecting.\n\nIt was: What has it been like playing for her mother, longtime head coach Shelley Collier.\n\n“I actually get asked that question a lot,” she said with a laugh before adding that she does not know anything different. “I’ve been playing for her basically my whole life.”\n\nHer mother also gets asked periodically another question she is usually expecting: What was it like playing for Pat Summitt at Tennessee. A point guard on the Lady Vols’ first national championship team in 1987, she later went on to be a graduate assistant for Summitt before embarking on a high school coaching career now totaling roughly three decades.\n\nBut she has never forgotten the many lessons Summitt taught her, and one particularly stands out.\n\n“Pat always said, ‘You win with people,’ ” Collier said. “It’s not all about winning games. It is about the relationships you have along the way in your journey.”\n\nAs the Webb Lady Spartan team was battling deep into the playoffs yet again this winter, Collier recently reflected on a coaching career that has included several state championships and four other unique rewards – coaching her four daughters.\n\nShe formerly coached Katie (now on the Middle Tennessee State team) and Sydney. Now, Casey, a junior, and freshman Britney are on the Webb squad.\n\nCoach Collier grew up in a household large enough to field a team as well. The second-oldest of six siblings, the former Shelley Sexton first developed her love for basketball when she was in the third grade in Anderson County.\n\n“My grandmother got me interested in playing,” she said. “We would play in between the games or at halftime of the middle schools' girls and boys games at Lake City (now Rocky Top). And I grew up watching Tennessee basketball and Lady Vol basketball.”\n\nHer skill developed and she received invitations to the prestigious B/C All-Star basketball camps in Georgia. After finishing out her senior year in 1983 during the first year of Anderson County High School, a career that resulted in her picture later being placed outside the gym, she went on to play for Summitt at Tennessee.\n\nAlso following her there as a coach was her Anderson County coach, Tony Cross, who later went on to a successful career as the Belmont University women’s coach. But like coach Summitt, who had battled Alzheimer’s disease, he also died in recent months while only in his 60s. Collier also considers him a great mentor.\n\nOf the influence of Summitt on her life, Collier said, “There are many things I have learned from her. There is not a day that goes by that I do not think about her.”\n\nAfter finishing at Tennessee, Collier stayed on as a graduate assistant for coach Summitt and coached at Clinton and Karns before arriving at Webb just when she was starting her family with husband, Robby Collier, now a football assistant at Webb.\n\nWhile at Webb, she has had several standout players, including Glory Johnson, who went on to play for Tennessee. During at least one of Johnson’s games, Webb’s gym was packed with three college coaches – Summitt, Georgia coach Andy Landers and Kentucky coach Mickey DeMoss.\n\nSuch players have helped the Webb team enjoy perennial success. But for coach Collier, the daily banter with players has been as important as all the banners.\n\n“I’m very passionate about having an opportunity to work around young kids on a daily basis,” she said. “It is a blessing and a calling for me to be able to do that. Coaching is not something that I take lightly, as I try to give back to the game and to those who have influenced me and to the young ladies that I have the privilege of coaching every day.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been the special relationships that have come from getting the unusual opportunity to coach four daughters on a high school varsity level.\n\nFor Casey, that has been quite natural, even with all the obvious expectations and demands her mother has placed on all the team members.\n\n“It is definitely hard at times because she’s my mom, but I wouldn’t want to play for anyone else,” she said.\n\nCasey has been the daughter in the spotlight at Webb this year. While usually not the top scorer, she helps the team by providing various intangibles. And that has made Shelley a proud coach – and mom.\n\n“We don’t win on the court without her,” said Collier after the region championship victory over Christian Academy of Knoxville. “She does so much for us. She’s a point guard. She’s a leader.”\n\nCoach Collier jokingly added that her daughters have grown up seeing her as the coach of Webb, so they don’t know her in any other setting.\n\nBut Casey believes she deserves another title in addition to coach and mom – winner.\n\n“She’s the best coach in the state of Tennessee and I love her to death,” she added with feeling.\n\nKARNS\n\nUniversity Eye Specialists opens new office in Hardin Valley\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nUniversity Eye Specialists officially opened its doors on 2547 Willow Point Way in Hardin Valley with a ribbon cutting celebration on Tuesday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe event was attended by several members of the Knoxville Chamber as well as Knox County Commissioners Michele Carringer and Brad Anders.\n\n“We are committed to serving patients with integrity and compassion, and we are honored to help our patients keep life in focus,” said Will Pitt, CEO of University Eye Specialists. “This new clinic allows us to offer even more vision care and optical options for our patients.\n\n“With 17 doctors, 14 medical and three optometrists, we provide a comprehensive range of eye care from the most routine to the most complex whether you need glasses or have a cornea issue. Our physicians are the only comprehensive ophthalmologists in the Knoxville area that treat Level One trauma patients at UT Medical Center.”\n\nFounded in 1935 by Dr. John L. Montgomery Sr., the practice has grown to five locations in Knoxville, Maryville and Morristown.\n\n“We’ve been recognized regionally and nationally by our peers for excellence in eye care, but most of all, we have caring hearts,\" Pitt said.\n\n“We’re excited to bring those caring hearts to the Hardin Valley area. We’re super excited about joining the community here. Coming here was an easy decision, we want to be part of the growth. It’s a wonderful area that’s certainly up and coming.”\n\nInfo: www.universityeye.com\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nPinchok announces he’ll seek another term\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“There’s too much unfinished business and I’d like to still be involved and make a difference in the community as long as I can,” declared Ron Pinchok as he revealed his decision to run for his second term as alderman, South Ward II. In a recent interview, the Board of Mayor and Alderman vice chairman talked about what’s important to Farragut, and to him.\n\n“We need to do what we can to help our retail and commercial businesses,” he said. How do we do that? Pinchok says, “By getting the right businesses to look at us, connecting with developers and then bringing them together. That in turn will benefit the town with increased sales tax revenues.” He cited Costco as a successful example.\n\nFuture development is another concern. “About 75 percent (of Farragut) is built out; now we have to be careful and pro-active.” Pinchok envisions the corridor north and east of I-40 and Campbell Station Road (Outlet Drive) as an optimal place for entertainment sites. “Ideally, businesses like restaurants, maybe a dinner theater, bowling alley or sports venue would provide families with activities.” The location lends itself to easy access for regional travelers.\n\nThat brings us to tourism. Pinchok says, “It’s another piece of the puzzle.” He has long been an advocate of attracting outside visitors to Farragut. With his extensive background in business, he understands return on investment. During the National League of Cities conference he attended, statistics confirmed that marketing and advertising dollars generate impressive returns.\n\nAccording to the study presented at that conference, every dollar spent returns $115 to local businesses, with $6 returned to the tax base. The recent addition of a part-time tourism coordinator will enable the town to reach a larger audience. “We’ve done the branding, now we’ll do more marketing,” said Pinchok.\n\nPinchok has been in favor of continuing to improve parks, greenways and recreational facilities. “It adds to a healthier lifestyle and increases our property values,” he said. “We have seen the success of events like the Lawn Chair Concert series, and with the addition of a ‘great lawn’ and the other amenities planned for McFee Park, we can expand that.”\n\nA real “hot button” issue in town has been the proliferation of empty storefronts; BOMA is limited on what it can do to affect these private properties. Pinchok sees a way to avoid this in the future, noting, “Form-based building allows for sites to be repurposed for another use. Should a retail business go out, offices or other commercial uses can occupy the space with minimal renovation.”\n\nA 30-year resident of Farragut, Pinchok and his family have been involved in the community for many years. His wife, Debbie, serves on the PALS committee, and Pinchok, previously the chair of the Economic Development Committee, now serves as the liaison to the town. Also on the Tennova Metro Board of Directors, Pinchok looks forward to the future, saying, “ There are a lot of exciting things to come and I want to be part of that.”\n\nPOWELL\n\nAt JB's market, selling local goes back a long way\n\nMike Blackerby, Shopper News correspondent\n\nCombine a line of hard-to-find products, ultra-friendly customer service and a long local history and you’ve got JB’s Corner Market in Powell.\n\nAcross the street from Claxton Elementary School at 2231 Clinton Hwy., the quaint produce and goods store is a throwback to simpler times and has a strong local following.\n\n“We love local people and try to keep prices as low as we can,” said Natalia Meredith, who owns JB’s with her husband, Justin Meredith.\n\nJB’s has an assortment of authentic Amish products, ranging from meat and dairy products such as bacon and cheese, to jams, jellies and candy.\n\nDepending on the time of year, JB’s also offers a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables and different types of beans in bulk.\n\n“In season, we buy our fruits and vegetables from local farmers,” said Natalia.\n\n“Soon we’ll have Grainger County tomatoes, green beans and cucumbers.”\n\nOther local products include items like honey and sorghum.\n\nFresh stone-ground Southern corn meal has trouble staying on the shelves.\n\n“They’re one of our better sellers,” said Natalia.\n\nYou can always find loaves of bread for sale at JB’s for just 99 cents.\n\nNatalia said her goal is to have as few products as possible with preservatives in the store.\n\n“Our Amish butter has just three ingredients – cream, salt and milk. There are no preservatives. We are trying to get people as healthy as possible. You won’t get something here that I wouldn’t eat myself. It’s not always possible to have foods without preservatives, but we’re very close.”\n\nJB’s has a long local history, according to Justin. “This building, an old gas station, was built in 1931,” he said.\n\nOperating local markets runs in the blood of the Meredith family.\n\nJustin’s grandfather J.B. Meredith opened Meredith’s City Food Market in downtown Clinton in 1950. Justin’s grandfather opened JB’s Market at its current location in 1975 before his father, who was also named J.B. Meredith, took it over in the 1980s.\n\nJustin took over the business in 2012 after the death of his father.\n\n“It does take you back in time,” said Justin.\n\nNatalia said a loyal local customer following allows JB’s to stay in business and compete against bigger box stores.\n\n“We’ve got one customer who is 94 years old who came to the store when it first opened and helped lay the blocks for the original building. He still comes to the store. People have been really good to us.”\n\nNatalia said the family is glad they decided to keep the store open following J.B.’s death in 2011.\n\n“We had a choice to get rid of it or keep it for his daddy,” she said.\n\n“I get a lot of joy out of it, personally.”\n\nJB’s (865-945-5580) is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\nHarold Agnew: a rich life built on music and faith\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nHarold Agnew never talks very long without breaking into song. The 90-year-old licensed barber, singer, guitar and piano player seems to know every gospel tune ever written. Snatches of melody constantly pepper his conversation. “The only problem is,” says Gary Gamble, owner of Gam’s Hair Fashions, where Agnew still works six days a week, “he never sings the whole song. You have to go to church to hear the whole thing.”\n\nLast Friday was Agnew’s 90th birthday, and there was a celebration for him at Rogers Memorial Baptist Church. Family and friends did indeed get to hear the tenor sing “the whole thing;” Agnew was happy to perform for them.\n\nBorn in Belton, S.C., to parents Allie and Henry, Agnew is the next-to-last in age of nine girls and seven boys. All are gone except one sister in S.C. and “my baby brother” in Boston, Mass., who will be 88 this year.\n\n“I was a farmer boy. We picked cotton, grew watermelon, cantaloupe, muscadines, climbed trees, raised cows. I made it through 10th grade; I don’t have a diploma. I graduated in experience. I’ve been through some things.”\n\nHe served in Germany during WWII as an Army corporal. Returning stateside, he was on his way to join his brother in Columbus, Ohio, and take a job in a steel mill when he came through Knoxville and met up with members of the Southern Travelers Gospel Singers. They needed a guitar player, “so I never got any further!” He became their lead tenor and guitarist; his brother Charles was also in the group. “They’re all gone now,” says Agnew. “I’m the only one left.”\n\nHis eyes twinkle. “You know who sponsored us? Cas Walker. He bought us our first uniforms.”\n\nAmong his treasure trove of pictures and memorabilia is a well-worn picture of his wife, Mallie. The two married in 1949 and he lost her in 2005 after 56 years of marriage. “We started in first grade together in S.C. That was Mallie. That was my wife. Shoot, I love that woman. Miss her.” The couple had four children — Harold Jr., who died in 2001; Robert Louis; Anna Ruth; and Rita, who just retired after 32 years as a schoolteacher.\n\nAgnew’s rich voice has made him the go-to singer in many situations, but mainly, he says, “I’m known as ‘the funeral singing man.’” Friend Rudy Warner says Agnew “has been at more funerals than the undertaker.”\n\n“At funerals I sing songs and talk — I’d rather have them laughing than crying. The scripture says ‘you mourn when people come into the world and you rejoice when they leave.’ But we do it backwards! What is that song — ‘I’ll have nothin’ to do … but just walk around heaven all day ….’ That’s a good one.”\n\nHe quotes his father: “Laugh when you’re tickled, come when you’re called, think before you speak and look before you leap.” And, he says, “I don’t worry about anything. I can’t undo what I did yesterday and tomorrow hasn’t gotten here yet. Worry and stress will get you. I live one day at a time.”\n\nBut mostly, says Agnew, “I can’t hate. The Bible says you have to love, and you can’t love and hate at the same time.”\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nPolitics on the menu at mayor candidate forum\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe Farragut/West Knox Chamber served up three candidates for Knox County mayor at the kickoff of its 2018 Breakfast Speaker Series at Fox Den Country Club on Feb. 20. The ballroom was packed as members and guests gathered to hear Brad Anders, Glenn Jacobs and Bob Thomas answer questions submitted by the chamber and audience.\n\nIntroduced as “the most trusted communicator in East Tennessee,” moderator Hallerin Hilton Hill laid out the ground rules: Each candidate would answer every question within the allotted time after giving an opening statement about why he was running.\n\nAnders, a nearly lifelong resident, has been with the Knox County Sheriff’s Office for 26 years and is currently a lieutenant in the Special Crimes Unit. He’s been a county commissioner since 2008, serving as chair and vice chair, and says the county “is better than it was (then) and I’m a part of that.”\n\nJacobs earned a national reputation as a professional wrestler and is the only candidate without political experience. The owner of an insurance business in West Knox, Jacobs is running “because I love this place (Knoxville).” He wants to ensure that “the standard of living and quality of life remains high.”\n\nFor Thomas, Farragut holds a special place; both his son and daughter are FHS grads. A county commissioner since 2014, he has 40 years of business and media experience. Thomas says, “I want to leave this place better than I found it.”\n\nHill asked how the trio would deal with safety and security. Anders said, “It’s right in my wheelhouse,” while Jacobs is in favor of a mental health task force. Thomas feels “there is a breakdown in society and family; all of us need to be part of the solution.”\n\nAn audience member posed a question that’s on everyone’s minds: “Do you plan on raising property taxes during your term?” Both Jacobs and Thomas answered no. Citing fiscal soundness and tremendous growth, neither is in favor of more taxes and would look to public-private partnerships and attracting business growth to fund government.\n\nAnders was more circumspect, noting that county debt has increased over the last three years. “It takes $2.5 million a day to run the county,” he said, adding, “I certainly don’t want to raise taxes, but to take it off the table is foolish and pandering to voters and we don’t know what three years or four years looks like from now.”\n\nSeveral other questions were asked and each candidate had equal time to present his ideas and vision. They all have different styles, but everyone wants good jobs, more educational opportunities, safety and infrastructure improvement.

The café doesn’t require a bus — they can just come and work.”\n\nSanders Plumbing reached out to see if the special education class needed anything. Upon request it donated coffee and snacks, and Jeremy Roberson, a manager at Lowe's on Clinton Highway, donated a mini-fridge. To keep costs down, parents donated snacks and drinks, and the faculty provided a cookie display cabinet.\n\nThe coffee cart business expanded so rapidly that they soon needed a larger space. “Our principal, Mr. Duff, was nice enough to give us this location,” said Reed about the former PTA storage closet. “It took about two days to clean it out and set it up.”\n\nAll items, including coffee, soda, candy bars, chips and pastries, are $1 unless they are in the 50-cent bargain bin. “Any money raised is put back into the café itself,” said Reed.\n\n“The main thing is to prepare them for work opportunities, so that they have experience to put on their resume.”\n\nRevenue is used to buy items in bulk and ingredients to bake more cookies, brownies and muffins. Tasks include preparing items, opening and closing, serving customers, inventory and restocking.\n\nWorking in the café allows students to develop their next-dollar (rounding up) and counting-back-change skills. “A lot of students are working on sorting,” said Reed. “For example, they sort the different sugar packages and the chips.”\n\nStudents also practice smiling and being pleasant to customers as well as focusing on the volume of their voices and appropriate proximity. “It’s been a great way to help them achieve their communication goal,” said Reed. “It encourages them to have communications with both their peers and staff at Halls.”\n\nRed Devil Café even boasts an online ordering system for the teachers. “They can go online and order via Google Docs or call in their order. Orders can be collected or delivered during a teacher’s specified planning time.\"\n\nAnd when students navigate the school to make deliveries, Reed said it helps increase their independence.\n\nReed said the cafeteria ladies have been particularly helpful and that community involvement has been overwhelming. “I want to be sure to mention Brenda Chesney, Kim Webb, Tammy Fox, Missy Green, Quineesh Phillips, Dale Richnafsky and our principal,” said Reed. “They all helped facilitate the café.”\n\nRed Devil Café is open every school day and staffed by students in the ninth through 12th grades working a rotating schedule. Set-up starts at 7:45 and the café opens at 8:30 a.m. and runs until noon, closing down for lunch and reopening 1:15-2:45 for afternoon snacks.\n\nIn the future, the class hopes to partner with local business to offer breakfast items – such as breakfast sandwiches and wraps on specific days.\n\nKARNS\n\nKarns Elementary kids put their hearts in it, raise $15K\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nMore than 200 students at Karns Elementary School got their hearts pumping jumping rope for the American Heart Association during the Jump Rope for Heart Celebration Day held at the school Wednesday, Feb. 14.\n\nThe kids raised nearly $15,000 in the two-week fundraising campaign, placing them in the top 10 statewide.\n\nBut it’s more than about money, says American Heart Association Youth Market Director Jenny Kitts. It’s about empowerment.\n\n“The kids learn the American Heart Association Five for Life, which is drink more water, eat more fruits and vegetables, be physically active every day, don’t touch the salt shaker, and don’t smoke.\n\n“They take the challenge to improve on one of these areas and to challenge others not only to donate money, but to improve on these areas as well.\n\n“It’s very powerful because it’s not uncommon for 100 people to drink more water or increase their activity level due to one fourth-grader.”\n\nGone are the days of knocking on doors. The kids gathered the money mostly through online activities featuring “The Scare Squad” characters and emailing friends and family to donate.\n\nThe kids earn a multitude of “Thank You” gifts along the way, including character plush, keychains, balls, jump ropes, and T-shirts.\n\nTen-year-old Emma Rainey raised $455, placing her among the top earners. She received almost all the available “Thank You” gifts, including a glow in the dark T-shirt, but she said it wasn’t about the prizes for her.\n\n“This is my third year doing this; next year will be my last, and I’ve challenged myself to raise $1,000 next year. It’s all to honor a family friend that had a heart transplant in 2015.\n\n“It’s nice to win all the prizes, but it’s better to help people,” she said.\n\nInfo: http://american.heart.org/jump-hoops\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nTo experience faith more meaningfully, look at the full story\n\nTom Ogburn, Shopper News columist\n\nSome years ago, I wrote a short and simple book about my family history. It was an appealing task because over the course of my lifetime, I had heard a number of family myths about our past. I was fascinated by some of the stories and was eager to find out more about them. As I looked more carefully at some of the more dramatic myths, they faltered under the weight of the research. The surprising thing was the true stories were actually more interesting, even more dramatic, than the myths I had heard. I was able to trace our family line back almost 400 years and learn more about those who carried our name well beyond that.\n\nOur family stories matter because as we learn more about where we come from, we discover some of what makes us who we are. We are now in the Lenten season, that 40-day period many Christian traditions claim as a time of preparation for Easter. If we are purposeful in claiming a time of preparation, it will invite us to both remember and explore our faith story – a discipline that illuminates who we are just as much as our family histories do.\n\nWe should remember those moments when we have seen God at work in our lives – those first moments of faith – when God’s love felt close and life-changing. In those stories, we find our place in God’s family. Galatians 3 tells us, So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.\n\nWe should also take this time to explore our faith story. So often we are content to hear stories from pastors or Sunday school teachers without taking the time to read the story on our own. This means we too often encounter God’s great story a small piece at a time. This would be a great time to read the whole story in the Gospel of Matthew or Luke. You might be surprised by some of what you encounter. When you read a gospel in its entirety, it can give you a fresh perspective of the depth and breadth of God’s love on display in Jesus. When you read the gospel story as a whole, you may discover that your faith story is even more powerful than you might have imagined.\n\nAs followers of Christ, we are an Easter people. But Easter can mean more to us if we walk with Jesus as he preaches, teaches, loves and cares for those he encounters on the way to Jerusalem. Easter can mean more to us when we take the time to purposefully come to the foot of the cross – redemption on display. Easter can mean more to us when we come to the resurrection tomb as witnesses of the great work of God through Jesus. We have a great faith story. Let’s take the journey toward Easter together.\n\nTom Ogburn, D.Min., is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

The three Cedar Bluff Elementary School students have been involved in community service before, but this was the biggest undertaking of their young lives.\n\nTroop leader and mom Becky Hatfield was brainstorming with the girls about a service project and that’s how Backpacks for Kids in Crisis took shape. The idea was to provide comfort to kids facing stressful situations like being placed in protective custody, staying in a homeless shelter or having their home destroyed by fire. “Even if it provides just a few minutes of happiness it’s worth it,” said Hatfield.\n\nThe backpacks are filled with necessities like toothbrushes, toothpaste and shampoo. Hats and gloves will provide warmth while stuffed animals, small toys, readers and activity books can help add a little diversion. Shelf-stable snacks, free ice cream and meal coupons from local restaurants are included, too.\n\nPlanning, organizing and getting donations took time and a lot of legwork. Over a dozen individuals and businesses generously gave cash, gift cards and products to the project. Sponsors were Delta Dental, Teacher Supply Depot, National Entertainment Network, Walmart, Publix, Food City, Second Harvest, Texas Roadhouse, Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen, and Burger King. Sheila Roark and Pam Smith are friends who contributed; others wanted to remain anonymous.\n\nFor the three Junior Girl Scouts, it was a life lesson and an opportunity to do something good for kids who need a little comfort. Talking about the experience, 9-year-old Savannah said, “I liked to help out other kids.” Alyssa, 10, noted, “When kids get taken away from their parents it can be upsetting.” And Addie, also 10, admitted “We had fun doing it.”\n\nOn a rainy Saturday 10 days ago, 217 bags were loaded up and delivered to the KARM shelter on Broadway, Rural Metro at Campbell Station and Knoxville Police Department headquarters. Three generations of families came along to lend a hand. Expressing what everyone felt, Hatfield said, “I’m so proud of all of them and their caring hearts.” Great job, girls, and now the Hatfields can get their dining room back!\n\nHALLS\n\nKids pour hearts into 'Blessing Bags' for needy\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nStudent Council members at Halls Elementary have been busy filling gallon zipper bags with snacks and simple, everyday items to hand out to people in need.\n\nThe bags, called Blessing Bags, are filled with tissue, gum, socks, lotion, personal items and snack foods. Students put the word out at school and church, asking for donations of items to fill the bags. Thanks to generous donations from the community, including a large donation from the Coffee family and Dental Partners Dr. Allen Hunley and Dr. Andrew Patten, more than 100 bags were assembled and ready to distribute.\n\nPaige LeQuire's family hands many of the bags out under the bridge near Knox Area Rescue Ministries and ministers to those in need through them.\n\n\"Knowing that we are providing a need feels good. I am very proud of what the group is doing to help others,\" said Paige.\n\nStudent Council members are in the fourth and fifth grades at Halls Elementary, and their hearts for giving are huge. When asked about the experience, many expressed good feelings of helping others, making a positive change in the community, letting people know they aren't forgotten and giving others hope through a smile and a kind gesture.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nWest swimmer/musician tunes up for college\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe multifaceted West High School junior Coleman Kredich enjoys the usually soft and melodic sounds he is able to make when playing classical music with his violin, an instrument he has played since age 2.\n\nBut his best route to college might be the loud splashing – but also rhythmic – sounds he makes in the pool as a freestyle sprinter.\n\nHe recently demonstrated these latter skills in the state high school swim meet by placing second in the 50-yard freestyle and third in the 100 free. His 50 time of 20.45 seconds was just behind Bearden senior Caleb Harrington, while his 100 free time was an also-satisfying 45.34 seconds at the University of Tennessee’s Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center.\n\n“I was really happy,” the 6-foot athlete said in an interview a few days after the meet. “I dropped my time in the 50 free. I get to go to Irvine (Calif.) for the Summer Junior Nationals.”\n\nWhile in California, he is likely to continue to be observed by a few college swimming coaches on the recruiting trail. Kredich said he definitely wants to swim in college.\n\n“I’m looking at UT, Duke, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania,” he said.\n\nDuke is where his parents went and where he is familiar with the coaches, he said. And he knows the coach at UT pretty well, too – his father, Matt Kredich, who heads up both the men’s and women’s programs.\n\nAs a result, he does not want to go to another SEC school where he would regularly have to compete against the elder Kredich.\n\nColeman said he loves the fact that his father is the coach, and he does not feel any extra pressure as a swimmer with that last name.\n\n“It’s pretty cool,” he said. “When I go to swim meets, people know who my dad is.”\n\nHowever, as far as receiving any extra tips about swimming from his father, it actually would have to come from osmosis. The elder Kredich deliberately does not want to interfere with the other coaches who work more closely with him.\n\n“I will ask him about something, and he says to go ask your coach,” Coleman said with a laugh.\n\nHis Tennessee Aquatics coach, Larry Hough, thinks he is doing just fine – in and out of the pool.\n\n“I would describe Coleman as a very happy person, one with a big personality and an exuberance for life,” said Hough, who knows a little about combining swimming and music as a former opera singer. “He is a very charismatic leader in the program; he leads both vocally and in deeds.”\n\nHe also said Coleman is a great competitor, who has never backed down from the opportunity to race, and wants to be the very best swimmer he can be.\n\nThis ambition has evidently carried over to the classroom as well. In fact, with three Ivy League schools on his college list, he has obviously had to burn the midnight oil along with a few calories.\n\nKredich said the International Baccalaureate program at West has really helped him. “That really prepares me for college,” he said. “All the classes are like college. I feel like I am really going to be ready.”\n\nKredich said he will likely pursue a career in finance or business due to his interest in math and working with numbers. But he has not completely ruled out following in his father’s footsteps as a coach, either.\n\n“That is definitely a possibility,” he said. “I do have a lot of respect for coaches and find it interesting.”\n\nFor now, though, he keeps pretty busy focusing on the present. Besides his academics, he also practices nine times a week when he is not participating in a meet. That includes twice a day on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and Wednesday morning, Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.\n\nThat might sound like a grinding schedule, but Kredich said he enjoys it.\n\n“When we have Wednesday night off, I don’t know what to do with myself,” he joked.\n\nSOUTH\n\nHearts sad as Chapman Pool closes after 60 years\n\nHeather Robinson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nMembers of Chapman Pool are saddened by the news that their summer destination has closed the gates for the last time.\n\nThis month, the board tearfully came to the decision to sell the property at 608 E. Gov. John Sevier Highway and close the pool that served area families for almost 60 years.\n\nThe notice of the sale, posted on the pool’s Facebook page, shocked many people. It gained attention from members past and present, as well as those who never held membership but wished they had. Before the quick sale of the property, community members hoped there was something they could do to help, but it was too late. The pool had been in financial struggle for years.\n\nThe property sold this week for the asking price of $199,999, but representatives of the pool would not disclose the buyer or their intent for the property.\n\n“It breaks my heart,” says Carissa Mitchell, board president of Chapman Pool. “Sometimes very difficult decisions have to be made.”\n\nThe sale caused deep sadness and made generations of families nostalgic for the memories the property holds.\n\n“I will miss having a great place for my kids to play,” says Mitchell. “I felt like the facility was perfect for kids. There were days that we would stay for hours and lots of people would spend the whole day.”\n\nThe pool, which was built in the 1960s, operated as a nonprofit and relied on memberships to generate revenue that was used toward maintenance and repairs. After suffering financial hardship for several seasons, the board decided it would sell the property and refund any prepaid memberships. Money left over from the deal would be donated to the local schools where their membership derived.\n\n“The silver lining is that a few local elementary schools will be receiving a donation from the sale of the pool,” says Mitchell. “(It's) a final effort by the board and the founders of Chapman Pool to be a benefit to the community of South Knoxville.”\n\n“I want people to know that we did try and we tried everything we could,” says Mitchell. “We did not come to this decision lightly, or quickly. We spent thousands of hours and thousands of our own dollars to stay afloat.”\n\nIn addition to the high cost of maintaining a pool as old as Chapman Pool, memberships have dwindled over the last decade.\n\n“We just couldn’t keep up with the changes in how families choose to spend their free time, nor are pools designed to last nearly 60 years,” says Mitchell.\n\nAsked what the future holds for the property that currently houses an Olympic-size pool with a high dive, a kiddie pool, a gazebo and a lovely lawn, Mitchell is unsure.\n\n“I don’t know what will happen to the property,” says Mitchell. “I pray for a pool or recreation facility to continue.”\n\nTime will tell what becomes of the property, but for those who cherished this pool, hope remains that it can still be used for the good of the community.\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\n‘Lady Bosses of Knoxville’ at the Hive\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe Hive on Central Avenue was abuzz recently when Lady Bosses of Knoxville held one of their every-other-month lunch programs.\n\nGuests ate green salad, grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, rolls and brownies; sweet and not-sweet tea was offered. The vibe was energetic and engaged.\n\nBegun in June of 2017, the lunches grew out of a desire for women to gather and trade personal and professional ideas. “We just wanted to bring women of any stage in their career together with other women who’ve reached their goals, to see it could be done,” says Hannah Houser, community event planner for the Hive. “We’ve even had a couple of guys come, which is cool. They’re here to listen and learn.”\n\nSo far the group has enjoyed programs on Creatives, Foodies, Home & Lifestyle and Branding. This time the topic was Activism. Featured were Claudia Caballero, executive director of Centro Hispano; Katie Willocks, senior case manager for Bridge Refugee Services; Ghada Ayesh, teacher and daycare director at Annoor Academy; and Jessica Dean, professor of English at Pellissippi State Community College.\n\nDean says her activism began when she was a church secretary in North Carolina and she found people excluded — specifically residents of a nearby work-release halfway house who were looking for a church. This instance, she says, awakened her passion for “looking to the people at the margins — those who aren’t being included.” She spoke of the importance of listening to those in need, instead of going into a situation and trying to impose already-decided-upon actions. “What don’t I know? What don’t I see?”\n\nAyesh became involved in founding Annoor Academy because her own kids needed a place to feel safe and not “different” observing their religious customs while receiving an education. In 2015, she was named an Exceptional Educator by the Knoxville News Sentinel for her work with preschool students. “In the past two years I’ve found myself wanting to connect more” outside the school, she says. “My job now is trying to encourage the youth to give back to the community.”\n\nCaballero’s advice is, “Don’t be afraid to rock the boat. Change doesn’t happen unless you do that. You have to be persistent in life.” Willocks agrees. “As women, we’re taught to take a back seat. Instead, be the ‘Alexander Hamilton’ who annoys everyone.”\n\nAll spoke of the first step in creating a positive difference in the community: finding one’s passion.\n\nDean’s passion also extends to agriculture. As CEO of Clay Halo Farms & Kitchen, she employs college students as part of her Community-Supported Agriculture Apprentice program. “I started with a mint plant on my porch in college,” says Dean. “I killed three mint plants. And now I have a small farm.” She grins. “So watch out!”\n\nPOWELL\n\nProject or party, Rusty Cottage has all you need to DIY\n\nMike Blackerby, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThey take their home-craft projects seriously at the Rusty Cottage DIY Studio.\n\nIn fact, the motto for anything constructed at the popular Powell do-it-yourself workshop could very well be “Built to Last.”\n\nRusty Cottage, in Lambert Square at 6910 Clinton Hwy., opened in August.\n\nOwner Jamie Spickard holds workshops, private events and parties for DIY enthusiasts of all levels.\n\nEven if you don’t know how to hammer a nail or operate a power tool, Spickard will show you.\n\n“A lot of people don’t even know how to paint when they come in,” said Spickard with a laugh.\n\nShe decided to open her own business after doing DIY home projects for more than 20 years.\n\n“We were actually doing home-craft classes for friends out of our home and it got too big,” Spickard explained.\n\nDIY participants learn to make many of the same farmhouse-style wood signs and home-décor items that Spickard makes and sells out of her shop.\n\n“I cut out everything and make it myself,” she said. “The most popular things we have are home signs, door hangers and blanket ladders.”\n\nSpickard said there are several reasons why people are turning to DIY projects instead of buying home-décor items from more traditional stores.\n\n“They can personalize their home décor and projects and make it fit their homes,” she offered. “Also, a lot of people come in to make gifts for weddings, showers and house warmings.”\n\nAnd of course, the final products that come out of DIY projects at Rusty Cottage are built to last.\n\n“This is solid wood,” said Spickard, pointing to one of her wall hangings.\n\n“We use a lot of birch, plywood, pine and cedar. All of our porch signs are made of cedar to last long because they’re going to be hanging outside.”\n\nYou can tell that Rusty Cottage is a workshop.\n\nIn addition to the finished products that hang on the walls and adorn the shop, various workshops are scattered throughout. Stacks of wood, tools and paint are just waiting to be transformed into that special home project.\n\n“I’ve got people that come in two to three times a month to make gifts,” said Spickard.\n\nEverything you need to pull off your DIY project is provided in the classes.\n\n“When you come to the workshop you pick out what you want to make,” explained Spickard, who carries 70 colors of paint.\n\n“Everything you need is laid out for you. We have your smock, stains, paints, brushes and tools already laid out. We could have 30 people making 30 different projects.”\n\nSpickard is excited about an upcoming workshop.\n\n“We’ll be making cornhole boards in the spring.”\n\nSpickard said there are usually at least “two or three” DIY instructors on hand for the classes, which can handle a maximum of 34 people.\n\n“It gets a little crazy sometimes. It’s just a way for people to get together and have fun. People can bring wine, beer and order pizza.”\n\nTo inquire about upcoming workshops or book a private party, call 865-859-9282 or visit www.rustycottagetn.com.\n\nOPINION\n\nPeople and pets: Our hearts beat together\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nI was juggling too many things at once. I had work to do and bills to pay. I had to pack for an upcoming trip and work through some construction problems for our remodeling project. My phone kept ringing. The kids kept texting. I had errands to run and groceries to buy. I was tired and tense. I felt the weight of a thousand little problems that amounted to nothing but still felt like a burden.\n\nThen I looked at my Great Dane, Lily, and saw the walnut-sized lump on her jaw. I put aside my computer and my papers. I tossed my to-do list aside and put my house plans on the counter. I dropped everything I was doing to take Lily to see our veterinarian.\n\nShe was miserable on the ride over. I could feel her hot breath on my neck. I could hear her heavy panting and see her soft fur flying round the car. I opened the back windows and tried to soothe her with my voice. “You’re OK, big girl. No one is going to hurt you.” I could tell she didn’t believe me.\n\nShe was even more anxious at the vet’s office. Her body was shaking. And like most Great Danes do, she leaned against me for comfort. I wrapped my arms around her body.\n\nThe vet came in a few minutes later and confirmed what I already suspected. Lily had an abscessed tooth. Her gums were red and swollen; she was in pain. While I waited for her prescriptions, I stroked her ears and rubbed her belly. She pressed herself against me so hard, I could barely keep my balance.\n\nOn the way home, she kept her face next to mine so she could lick my cheek and nibble my ear while I drove. She whined, softly. And in a strange flashback, I thought of taking my kids to see the pediatrician when their throats were sore and their fevers were high.\n\nWhen we got back home, Lily raced to her bed and plopped down with a groan. She was ready to relax, but I was too wound up to settle down. The stress of the day washed over me. My papers were just where I left them. My shopping list was still waiting. My to do-list was staring at me. The construction problems I had put on hold to take Lily to the vet hadn’t resolved themselves in my absence.\n\nI looked at Lily, curled in the tiniest ball a Great Dane can manage, and I smiled. Without giving it much thought, I walked over to her bed and scooted down next to her. I rested my head against her soft body and let her warmth comfort me.\n\nShe made her happiest noises then and turned her head until our faces were touching. Her breathing slowed and so did mine. She sighed contentedly and so did I. We closed our eyes.\n\nI felt the stress fall away from us. And if I had been her mother earlier in the day, caring for her when she was sick, she was my friend now helping to ease the burdens of an ordinary day that, for some reason, didn’t feel ordinary at all.\n\nWe fell asleep like that, and when I woke up a few minutes later, I felt better. We both got what we needed on that stressful day. And though Lily couldn’t say so, I think we were both grateful for the ties that bind us together.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.\n\nHALLS/FOUNTAIN CITY\n\nCHS Alumni Association presents check to Central High School", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/26"}]}

Sentebale means \"forget-me-not\" in the local language of Lesotho in southern Africa.\n\nCo-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, as well as the board of trustees, joined Harry in leaving Sentebale following a leadership dispute with chair Sophie Chandauka, a Zimbabwe-born lawyer who has refused to step down and sued the charity in order to retain her position, according to The Times. Britain's Charity Commission confirmed to the outlet on Tuesday that an investigation is underway.\n\n\"Nearly 20 years ago, we founded Sentebale in honor of our mothers.

Connell also resigned, saying: “My view is that the person chairing any organisation should take responsibility if it appears that serious misconduct may have taken place within it,” Sky News reported.\n\nThe Prince of Wales has denied any knowledge of the alleged quid pro quo. Mahfouz has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\n‘Indispensable’ aid\n\nThe son of an accountant from Orpington, southeast London, Fawcett joined the staff at Buckingham Palace in 1981.\n\nHe initially worked as a footman to the Queen before becoming an “indispensable” aide to the Prince of Wales – so close that he would “[squeeze] Charles’s toothpaste so the heir could brush his teeth”, said The Sunday Times.\n\nThought to be in his late 50s, Fawcett worked as Prince Charles’s valet for 40 years, with the royal once saying that he could “manage without just about anyone except Michael”. He resigned in 2003 after a report by the Prince’s private secretary “identified mismanagement in Charles’s household”.\n\nSir Michael Peat’s probe found that “Fawcett had broken regulations by accepting presents from royal suppliers, including a £3,000 club membership and a Rolex watch”. He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2018, Fawcett was appointed to run the Prince’s Foundation, a charity that organises educational programmes and training for people of all ages and backgrounds, with a sustainability focus.\n\n‘Doctored’ letter\n\nAn inquiry carried out independently by auditing firm Ernst & Young late last year concluded that Fawcett had co-ordinated with “fixers” to land an honour for Mahfouz, something that the charity’s trustees were unaware of, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nIt also found that Fawcett and an unnamed senior employee had been involved in directing money from Mahfouz’s charity to the Children and the Arts foundation (Cata), described by The Sunday Times as “a semi-defunct charity for disadvantaged youths which has the prince as its patron”.\n\nCharles’s charity had initially received a £100,000 donation from the Russian banker Dmitry Leus via the Mahfouz Foundation, but it had been rejected by the Prince’s Foundation’s ethics committee because of a money-laundering conviction that was later overturned.\n\nThe Sunday Times said that Fawcett “bypassed his own ethics committee” to retain Leus’s money by transferring it to Cata. The transfer was arranged by an intermediary, which meant that Leus “did not know what had happened to his money and the charity did not know the true provenance of the funds”.\n\nFawcett is said to have arranged a “thank you” letter for Leus from Cata. But the inquiry found that Cata “did not write it and believe that it was ‘doctored’”.\n\nFawcett did not respond to The Sunday Times’ questions about the supposedly doctored document, which is likely to be important in Scotland Yard’s probe.\n\n‘Timing couldn’t have been worse’\n\nThe timing of the Met’s investigation “couldn’t have been worse”, said the BBC’s royal correspondent Daniela Relph. Wednesday morning’s headlines were focused on Prince Charles’s brother Prince Andrew and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre. Just a few hours later, “things became more complicated”.\n\nRoyal sources told the Daily Mail that there had been “genuine shock” in Buckingham Palace that the cash-for-honours probe had come “on top of the Andrew fall-out”, with one telling the paper: “I can only see this getting worse.”\n\nQuestions have been raised over whether Prince Charles, who is currently recovering from Covid, will be interviewed by the Met as part of their investigation. Sources emphasised to the Daily Mail that the royal “would be willing to speak to detectives and help with their inquiry in whatever way he could”.\n\nIt’s been a turbulent 2022 for the royal family so far – a year that was meant to be all about celebrating the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, a historic first for a British monarch.

Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped down from royal duties last year and the couple now lives in California with their children, 2-year-old Archie Harrison and newborn Lilibet Diana.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge, who is second in line for the British throne, remains in the U.K. with his wife, Duchess Kate of Cambridge, and their three children: Prince George, who turns 8 later this month, Princess Charlotte, 6, and Prince Louis, 3.\n\nHarry and William commissioned the statue of their mother in 2017 to honor her legacy after she died in a Paris car wreck in 1997. Four years later, following a killer pandemic that continues to keep England locked down, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex are living on different continents and barely speaking to each other.\n\nTo recap, Harry and his biracial American wife, the former Meghan Markle, stunned his family and Britain by abruptly quitting their royal roles and moving to America in 2020. A year later, in March 2021, they told Oprah Winfrey in a TV interview that they did so because they were fed up with racism in the British media and in the royal family. Meghan said that someone in the royal family, but neither the queen or Prince Philip, had raised concerns about \"how dark\" Archie's skin might be when he was born. Harry said he wanted to protect Meghan, who became suicidal from the pressure of royal life.\n\nWilliam was so cross about what Harry has said about the royals in public that he uncharacteristically spoke out himself, sternly declaring to a reporter, \"We're very much not a racist family.\"\n\nFollowing Prince Philip's death on April 9, Harry returned to join his family at the April 17 funeral. He and William entered the funeral separated by their cousin, Peter Phillips, but left later standing shoulder to shoulder in conversation.\n\nAhead of Thursday's unveiling, the brothers released a joint statement thanking statue designer Ian Rank-Broadley and garden designer Pip Morrison for their efforts to \"keep our mother's memory alive.\"\n\n“Today, on what would have been our Mother’s 60th birthday, we remember her love, strength and character – qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better,\" they said. “Every day, we wish she were still with us, and our hope is that this statue will be seen forever as a symbol of her life and her legacy.\"\n\nThe new Princess Diana statue sits in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace, one of her favorite spots at the palace and where Harry and Meghan announced their engagement in November 2017.\n\nAhead of the unveiling – which was delayed due to the pandemic – the palace shared details about the garden's redesign, which keeps historic structures and now includes several of Diana's favorite flowers, including forget-me-nots. The garden and statue will be open to the public during palace visiting hours.\n\n“While she was in residence at Kensington Palace, Diana, Princess of Wales, regularly admired the changing floral displays in the Sunken Garden and would always stop to talk with me and the other gardeners who cared for it,\" read a statement from Graham Dillamore, Deputy Head of Gardens and Estates at Historic Royal Palaces.\n\n“Over three decades later, I’m honored to have been part of the team preparing the garden for the installation of this statue. We’ve incorporated a number of the Princess’s favorite flowers into the design, and I hope that visitors to the palace and gardens will enjoy its peaceful setting, and take a moment to reflect on the life and legacy of the Princess.”\n\nA day prior to the statue unveiling, Harry made a surprise appearance at a London charity event to meet with seriously ill children.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harry visited Kew Gardens in west London for an awards ceremony for WellChild, a charity he is patron of. He was joined at the garden party by celebrities including Ed Sheeran and Ronnie Wood.\n\nHe chatted with children who won awards and their families, and was seen telling some of those attending that it was “quite a juggle” coping with his newborn daughter, Lilibet, and his 2-year-old son, Archie.\n\nIn a statement released by WellChild, Harry said the charity had “an extraordinarily special place in my heart.”\n\n“Now as a father of two, I feel all the more connected, inspired and in awe of the resilience of these families, who power through indescribable challenges with the support of WellChild,” he said.\n\nPrince William visited Scotland over the past few days with Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate Holyrood Week, known in Scotland as Royals Week, which \"celebrates Scottish culture, achievement and communities,\" according to the palace.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY; and the Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/society/955444/how-royal-titles-work", "title": "How royal titles are given | The Week", "text": "The death of Queen Elizabeth II meant her eldest son Charles immediately became the UK’s new King, and led to other members of the Royal Family also assuming new titles.\n\nUpon the Queen’s death, Charles, who had been the Prince of Wales, a title traditionally reserved for the heir to the throne, became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Known as the Letters Patent, the edict said that all children and grandchildren of the sovereign through a male line can hold the titles of prince and princess.\n\nPrince Edward, the youngest of the Queen’s children and currently the Earl of Wessex, could become the Duke of Edinburgh, with his wife Sophie becoming the Duchess of Edinburgh, although no official title change has yet been made.\n\nCan titles be removed?\n\nThe Queen stripped Prince Andrew of his honorary military titles and patronages after a US judge ruled that a civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations against him could proceed to trial in January 2022.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced the decision following the publication of an open letter signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans that urged the Queen to remove her second son’s eight British military titles.\n\nSome of these titles were inherited by Andrew from his late father, Prince Philip, including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, described by the BBC as “one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army”.\n\nBut Andrew “has not lost everything”, wrote Craig Prescott, a law lecturer at Bangor University, in an article on The Conversation. Along with his rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy, Andrew retains his birth title of “prince” and “remains the Duke of York, which is a peerage”, Prescott explained. And he is also still ninth in line of succession to the throne.\n\nHow the peerage works\n\nThe peerage is a centuries-old ranking system for British nobility. Five ranks of the peerage still exist today: duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron.\n\nDuke is the “highest and most important rank”, explained online history magazine Historic UK. Edward III created the first duke, in 1337, when he made his eldest son the Duke of Cornwall – a title now held by Prince William. Dukes (and duchesses, the female counterpart) are addressed as “your grace”.\n\nAndrew became Duke of York when he married Sarah Ferguson in 1986. The title is traditionally granted to the monarch’s second son and has previously been held by the Queen’s father, George VI, and her grandfather, George V.\n\nUnlike military titles, Andrew’s peerage can only be removed by an Act of Parliament. A peerage removal “can only be done by statute, passed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and receiving royal assent, which means the agreement of the Queen”, said the i news site.\n\nCalls for Andrew to lose his dukedom have been growing, particularly in York, where a city council member has launched a campaign backing the move.\n\nBut there is no historical precedent for the removal of a title of peerage by the Queen: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex despite quitting royal life in January 2020.\n\nOther ranks of the peerage\n\nA marquess, which is next in the line of nobility after a duke, is formally addressed as “lord”, and the wife of a marquess is a marchioness, addressed as “lady”. Only one woman in history has been created a marchioness in her own right: Anne Boleyn, prior to her marriage to Henry VIII.\n\nThe next rank in order of precedence is earl. The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon “eorl”, meaning military leader. After earl comes viscount, a title created in the 15th century, and then baron, a name derived from the Old German word “baro”, meaning freeman.\n\nTitles of the peerage may be hereditary or granted for life. Historically, hereditary peers have had the right to sit in the House of Lords. However, following the House of Lords Act of 1999, most hereditary peers have now been “ejected”, with fewer than 100 remaining.\n\nThese days, new hereditary peerages are only granted by the Queen to members of the Royal Family. According to The Independent, the grandchildren of sons of the reigning monarch are automatically given the title of “prince” or “princess”, but any title beyond that – such as duke or duchess – “is granted by courtesy”.\n\nThe meaning of HRH\n\nHRH (His or Her Royal Highness) titles have been issued to children and grandchildren of the monarch since the early 18th century, at the discretion of the monarchs of the time.\n\n“Not everyone has accepted the offer of an HRH,” said CNN. The Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, turned it down for her children, Peter and Zara.\n\n“That’s in contrast to Prince Andrew, who allowed his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, to carry it,” added the US-based news network.\n\nPrince Andrew still retains his HRH title – described by The New York Times as “a prized symbol of his status as a senior member of the Royal Family” – but he will not be able to use it in any official capacity. This puts him on the same footing as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex following their move to California.\n\nAndrew and the Sussexes are not the first Royals to be prevented from using the HRH titles. The Queen also stripped Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson of the title following their divorces from Charles and Andrew respectively. Diana was instead given the courtesy title of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nHow royal patronages work\n\nMembers of the Royal Family lend their name to a charity or organisation in a show of royal support that can provide “vital publicity” for a cause and “add status”, according to the family’s official website.\n\nAs well as losing his honorary military titles and the use of HRH, Andrew has also been stripped of his many royal patronages. In November 2019, “when the Duke of York stepped down from public duties, he held 230 patronages”, said the i news site.\n\nAndrew’s patronages were returned to the Queen and redistributed to other members of the Royal Family.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Hollie Clemence", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/polo/2024/04/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-in-wellington-florida-for-polo-charity/73300623007/", "title": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle in Wellington, Florida for polo, charity", "text": "WELLINGTON — Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made a surprise visit to Palm Beach County this week, with Harry taking part in a panel in South Beach Thursday and the couple spending time in Wellington on Friday for a polo match.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who now live in California, arrived around 4:30 p.m. Friday at the Grand Champions Polo Club for the Royal Salute Polo Challenge to benefit Sentebale.\n\nThey were shuttled to the field that sits west of the National Polo Center.

His team included 10-goaler Poroto Cambiaso, Malcolm Borwick (5) and Dana Barnes (0). Polo players are rated on a scale of minus-2 to 10, with -2 being a novice player. Professionals generally carry a handicap of 5 or above.\n\nWellington has become known for hosting royalty mainly because of its sprawling polo and equestrian community. Harry's father, Prince Charles, now the King of the United Kingdom, gave the village worldwide notoriety when he started playing polo in Wellington more than four decades ago.\n\nKnown then as the most famous polo player in the world, King Charles visited several times, including 1985 when he was joined by Princess Diana, a spectacle that drew more than 15,000 people to the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club.\n\nKing Charles' highest rating was a 4-handicap.\n\nAfter watching his father play polo, Harry started playing at a young age, often with his older brother, Prince William. He has become more active in the sport since he and Meghan moved to Montecito, Calif., in 2020 and Harry started training and playing at the Santa Barbara Polo Club.\n\nHarry and Meghan heading up two Netflix projects\n\nOn Thursday, it was announced Harry and Meghan are the executive producers of two Netflix projects, one of those focused on polo and filmed primarily in Wellington, including cameras following around the couple Friday.\n\nThe polo series was shot at the U.S. Open Polo Championship, which started March 22 and concludes April 21.

Snooki put the Jersey Shore town on the map; Sandy just about wiped it off. But Harry put it back on.\n\nAlmost seven months after the superstorm thrashed the boardwalk and pier, Prince Harry surveyed the scene himself — and returned the spotlight to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe prince spent the morning of the sixth day of his U.S. tour back on the East Coast, visiting the site of some of the worst of Sandy's $71 billion in damage. His first stop was to a residential area still heavily damaged by the hurricane.\n\nThe second stop was to the recovering beachfront commercial strip, which includes the Shore Store, where the Jersey Shore gang worked. Gov. Chris Christie accompanied the prince for the 90-minute tour.\n\nChristie, dressed in a mint-green shirt, gave Harry, dressed in a white button-down shirt and dark aviators, a fleece jacket similar to the one he wore during days of dealing with the storm. Among those Harry met first were first responders.\n\nIt was a crisp and clear spring day, gloriously sunny. Cranes and games and funnel-cake stands share a swath of freshly rebuilt boardwalk here. Security was relative light: sniffing dogs but no metal detectors. The crowd was three-deep by the barricades, and fans squealed when they caught sight of Harry arriving.\n\nHarry tried one of the boardwalk booth games, tossing balls into a bucket and competing with kids from Seaside Heights Elementary as well as the governor. But no joy for them; the kids walked away with the stuffed toys.\n\nAlexandra Cirigliano got to do what most 7-year-olds only dream of: meet a prince.\n\n\"He looks really different\" from what she was expecting. Where was his crown? \"At his hometown?\" Alexandra said, scrunching up her face.\n\nHer ball-tossing partner was the governor — \"he got one in\" — but it was the prince who acted as her knight in shining sunglasses: He won her a stuffed Hello Kitty.\n\n\"He's cute,\" concluded her sister, Taylor, 11.\n\n\"It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" said mom Jill Cirigliano. \"I think their teacher will understand why they're not in school.\"\n\nLater today, Harry will attend a charity fundraising gala.\n\nHarry, third in line to the throne and a captain in the British Army, is on his second-to-last day of a week-long visit to the USA to promote Britain, support the military and raise money for his charities. Tomorrow, he travels to Greenwich, Conn., to play in a polo match to raise money for his African children's charity, Sentebale.\n\nSo far, the prince has been a hit everywhere he has gone since he arrived Thursday, charming, chatting, joking and impressing, engaging enthusiastically in whatever he's doing, especially if it's military- or sports-related. He set women squealing on Capitol Hill, joined military families at a White House party, saluted smartly at Arlington National Cemetery and bucked up wounded warriors still recovering at Walter Reed or competing at the Warrior Games in Colorado Springs.\n\nEver since his boffo tour of the Caribbean and Latin America last spring, when he represented grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana's second son has proved he has not only matured, but he's a natural at the whole royal thing.\n\nAnd that day in Las Vegas last year, when he was photographed naked in a hotel room during a private visit before deploying to Afghanistan?

Three archaeologists and an architect are wearing yellow vests and carrying iPads, snapping pictures and recording information about every structure built before 1969. Those actions are part of a two-week effort, during which Paleowest Archaeology will visit 2,500 structures in west Montgomery neighborhoods to identify culturally significant buildings, histories and landmarks related to the struggle for civil rights. Once the data is compiled, a historian and researcher will comb through the information to provide a complete history of the culturally significant neighborhoods. “Montgomery has a rich civil rights history,” said Robert Smith, planning director for the city and the mastermind behind the project. “The city does not have a comprehensive document of that civil rights history.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state labor department report says recent job gains after three years of losses could signal the end of the state’s recession. The report says Alaska saw year-over-year job growth for seven straight months, starting in October. This followed revisions to 2018 figures. The Anchorage Daily News reports the department revises job numbers after releasing initial estimates. While the growth was small, department economist Karinne Wiebold says it strengthens the case that the economy is recovering. The numbers remain subject to change, and Wiebold says it’s too early to say the downturn is truly over. The recession, which began in 2015, is the longest Alaska has seen, though it wasn’t on the level of an economic crash that occurred in the 1980s.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Dozens of Asian-owned businesses have set up shop in western Mesa, with two large supermarkets serving as anchors for development that includes restaurants and other businesses. The commerce cluster is aided by proximity to Mesa Community College and the presence of Arizona State University’s main campus in neighboring Tempe. With the closing of the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix last year, many see the Asian business district in Mesa as a natural successor to become a hub for Asian-Americans in metro Phoenix. Property manager Steven Diep says when Mekong Plaza opened in 2008, fewer than 10 Asian-owned businesses were open in the area. Now, Mekong is at full occupancy with 28 tenants and has spurred development in the rest of the Asian business district in Mesa.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Hemp and CBD producers are hopeful about the future of the industry in the state. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that CBD has been extracted from Arkansas’ first legal hemp harvest. CBD is a chemical compound derived from cannabis plants, and users say it can ease pain, anxiety, epilepsy, nausea and hangovers. It doesn’t cause a high and is often sold as a dietary supplement. Hemp also belongs to the cannabis family and can be used in products including rope and paper. Congress legalized industrial hemp in December. Industry experts expect the CBD market in Arkansas to explode over the next five years. Some farmers hope they’ve found their newest cash crop. The Food and Drug Administration is assessing how it should regulate CBD, which is largely unregulated by the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: A fast-moving brush fire erupted near a huge amusement and water park Sunday, sending hundreds of visitors to the exit to escape clouds of smoke and ash before fire officials asked them to stay put while they worked to contain the blaze. Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor announced the evacuation shortly after noon, citing concern for the safety of park visitors and employees. About a half-hour later, the park said on its Twitter account that fire officials asked guests to shelter in place due to nearby road closures. Park visitors were asked to move to the back of the 260-acre property, away from firefighting activity near the entrance, said Rachel Gallat, who was visiting a friend who works at the park. “I was getting iced coffee and when I walked outside, ash was raining down on me,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A ski resort trade association expects visits to the state’s ski resorts to be up 13% from last year following a snowy winter and spring that extended the ski season. The Denver Post reports Colorado Ski Country USA released its projections Thursday, showing a nearly 12% increase in visits from the five-year average. The group that represents 23 resorts expects the season to end with 13.8 million skier days, which measures people participating in skiing or snowboarding for any part of one day at a resort. The Rocky Mountain region is projected to end the season with 24 million skier days. The region includes Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Wesleyan University’s Center for the Arts has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support residency activities of the dancer Netta Yerushalmy. The $15,000 Art Works grant also will support a performance by Yerushalmy on Oct. 4 in the Center for the Arts Theater. Center for the Arts director Sarah Curran said support from the NEA is central to its ability to bring contemporary dance to audiences that might not otherwise be able to see it. Yerushalmy grew up in Israel and has been based in New York since attending college there.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Parts of a neighborhood damaged in the 1968 riots ignited by Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination are set to be redeveloped after many years of empty restoration promises. The 36-block West Center City neighborhood never rebounded from the riot and an ensuing nine-month occupation by the National Guard. It has struggled with vacant homes and gun crimes ever since. For decades, city officials promised restoration and development initiatives that didn’t happen. Now state grants to demolish and rebuild several properties have been awarded, and the Wilmington Housing Authority also plans to renovate and sell about 20 properties. A demolition and rebuilding project by the nonprofit Wilmington Land Bank started last week and is set to be completed by March.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Logan Circle in northwest D.C. has been named one of the nation’s 28 friendliest neighborhoods, WUSA-TV reports. The National Geographic Traveler magazine list is based on user-generated data such as walkability, home affordability, and social surroundings such as the number of nearby restaurants, breweries and cafes. National Geographic Traveler also used perception data from TripAdvisor and Yelp to create the unranked list of the United States’ most open-minded and open-hearted neighborhoods. Logan Circle made the list for its design-centric shops and dozens of restaurants in early 20th-century and contemporary buildings. The list features Colada Shop for its rooftop Cuban cocktails and empanadas, as well as Miss Pixie’s Furnishings & Whatnot for unique finds like old postcards and 1960s lamps.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: A famous part of South Beach is getting a makeover. City of Miami Beach officials unveiled tons of new equipment Sunday for the popular outdoor workout area along A1A, known as Muscle Beach. Locals and tourists frequent the area, which includes equipment for push-ups and pull-ups. Muscle Beach is free and open to the public. But the area was lacking in strength training equipment. The city added a multi-modality training center for up to 80 people including 18 pull-up stations, a rope climb tower and five squat stations. There are also medicine balls, kettle bells, bumper plates and battle ropes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The Richmond County Coroner’s Office has made progress in matching the military grave markers that were discovered at an old funeral home. Coroner Mark Bowen says the majority are for veterans who have been buried locally. The National Cemetery Administration, the Richmond County Vital Records Office and Richmond County Cemetery Services are also assisting in finding the graves of the veterans whose names are inscribed on the markers. About 125 bronze and marble markers were found. They date back to the late 1960s. The Augusta Chronicle reports that a deputy had discovered the markers in packages under old blankets and trash in the home’s garage. The deputy was assisting a land official who was preparing to show the property to Atlanta investors when the grave markers were discovered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of Honolulu’s planned rail line has submitted a revised recovery plan for the $9.2 billion project. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation CEO Andrew Robbins hand-delivered the plan to federal officials in San Francisco on Friday. The Federal Transit Administration has been withholding about $744 million in promised funding until it approves an updated recovery plan. The agency demanded that the city submit a recovery plan when the project’s price tag jumped from $5.3 billion. The City Council approved the plan by an 8-1 vote on Wednesday. The 20-mile-long rail line is due to connect Honolulu’s western suburbs to the airport, downtown and the Ala Moana Center, Oahu’s biggest mall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities are taking public comments on a plan to conduct an extensive environmental study involving killing wolves and other predators in the state that attack livestock, deer and elk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will take comments through July 10 on a planned environmental impact statement. A federal judge ordered the study last year after ruling the Agriculture Department’s Wildlife Services violated environmental laws by not providing the justification to support its decision to expand killing mountain lions, coyotes, bears and other predators in Idaho. The new environmental impact statement will replace the agency’s 2016 Idaho environmental assessment involving those predators, as well as its 2011 wolf environmental assessment that guides its wolf-killing decisions in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Dispensaries in the state are staffing up and remodeling in preparation for the legalization of recreational marijuana. The General Assembly approved the marijuana legislation last month, and it now awaits a signature from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. He plans to sign it, making Illinois the 11th state, along with the District of Columbia, to permit recreational use. Under the new law, adults could buy and possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. The measure would let the state’s 55 medical marijuana dispensaries submit applications to set up two more dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Companies already in the medical marijuana market said expansion to meet recreational needs could result in a hiring boom. If approved, sales would start Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The fifth annual Chreece hip-hop festival will bring Talib Kweli to the city. Kweli, a rapper known for eight solo albums as well as collaborations with Mos Def, Kanye West and Hi-Tek, headlines a 70-act lineup announced Monday. Chreece is slated for Aug. 24 at multiple Fountain Square venues. Kweli, who made landmark 1998 album “Black Star” with Mos Def, is one of multiple national acts on the festival’s roster. Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and Benny the Butcher will share the stage, representing Griselda Records. Houston rapper Fat Tony will promote his 2018 album “10,000 Hours.” The Chreece roster includes high-profile Indiana acts Flaco, Drayco McCoy, Trajik, Sirius Blvck & John Stamps, Clint Breeze & the Groove, Mathaius Young and Parris LaDame.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: It’s a stinky distinction, but the state leads the nation when it comes to the amount of poop its people and livestock generate, research from a University of Iowa scientist shows. Christopher Jones, a UI research engineer, calculated Iowa’s population would be the equivalent of 168 million people, based on the waste from the state’s 3.2 million people and nearly 110 million chickens, pigs, turkeys and cattle. It’s about as many people as in Bangladesh, a country in south Asia. Factor in land size, and Iowa ranks first in the nation for waste creation, Jones writes in a blog he’s titled “50 Shades of Brown.” “Just to ensure clarity, in Iowa, we are generating as much fecal waste in every square mile as 2,979 people,” he says. “For reference, Iowa City is the second-most densely populated city in Iowa and has 2,775 people per square mile. So imagine an Iowa-sized Iowa City.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: May was the wettest month in state history. The Kansas State University Weather Data Library says average rainfall in May was 10.26 inches, the wettest month on records going back 125 years. The Kansas News Service reports the deluge broke the previous record set in June 1951. In addition, 19 weather stations recorded monthly totals of more than 20 inches. The rainfall was uneven but followed typical patterns of being drier in the west and wetter in the east. Southeast Kansas stations averaged 17 inches in May, while west central Kansas stations averaged only 5.31 inches, which is still 175% of normal rainfall for the region in May. The amount of water moving through the state was the highest the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kansas Water Science Center has ever seen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An analysis of traffic stop data has found African Americans in the city are disproportionately stopped and are three times more likely to be searched than white drivers. Of 130,999 stops between 2016 and 2018, African Americans accounted for 33% of the stops, although they make up only about 20% of Louisville’s driving-age population. Of 8,942 searches, 57% involved African Americans. That’s despite a much higher incidence of contraband found with white drivers. According to the analysis, police found contraband in 72% of the searches of whites versus only 41% for African Americans. Speaking before the Metro Council Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, Police Chief Steve Conrad outlined changes in which stops will no longer be “a matter of routine.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSt. Joseph: New cabins are open at Lake Bruin State Park. The Louisiana Office of State Parks opened the accommodations at the site in St. Joseph on Friday. The park is in the Mississippi River delta, in the state’s southeast. Two standard cabins and one deluxe cabin are available for reservations. The one-bedroom cabins sleep up to four people and have a barbecue pit, fire ring and picnic table. They rent for $85 a night Sunday through Thursday and $95 a night on Friday and Saturday. The three-bedroom deluxe cabin sleeps up to eight people and has a two-car carport and two dedicated boat slips. It rents for $150 per night Sunday through Thursday and $175 per night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nMaine\n\nSkowhegan: Apparently hungry and thirsty vandals have trashed a fairgrounds booth, stealing 120 whoopie pies and drinking half a gallon of iced tea. John Youney, a director of the Skowhegan Lions Club, tells the Morning Sentinel that a refrigerator full of cookies was also emptied and that plastic gloves and silverware littered the floor. Youney says there’s about $1,000 worth of damage or stolen goods. The group discovered the break-in at its Skowhegan fairground booth Sunday morning and believes it occurred overnight Saturday. Youney says whoever is involved can confess and work off their crime by assisting the club with its volunteer work. A police officer said he could not comment on the investigation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBurkittsville: A video game inspired by the Maryland-based horror film “The Blair Witch Project” is expected to come to PCs and Xboxes in August. The Baltimore Sun reports the game was announced Sunday at a video game conference in Los Angeles. The game will draw on events from the 1999 film, with a release date of Aug. 30. The movie was shot in locations in Maryland, including the town of Burkittsville. The film follows a group of college students as they create a documentary in the Maryland woods about the legend of the Blair Witch. The low-budget film earned a reputation as a cult classic that popularized the “found footage” horror genre. According to the trailer, the game follows a detective’s search for a missing person amid supernatural occurrences.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: The town is taking a literary twist this week. The eighth annual Nantucket Book Festival opens Thursday and runs through June 16. It features more than 30 local authors, including Nantucket native and bestselling writer Nathaniel Philbrick. Philbrick will discuss the third book in his Revolutionary War series, “In the Hurricane’s Eye: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown.” Other participating award-winners include “Washington Black” writer Esi Edugyan, “The Library Book” author Susan Orlean, and Dave Cullen, who’s authored books about the Columbine and Parkland school shootings. The festival is operated by the Nantucket Book Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded to celebrate and promote the joys and rewards of reading, writing and literacy.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: Families can follow the yellow brick road as a project brings “The Wizard of Oz” to a local park. The Holland Sentinel reports that yellow bricks have been laid in Centennial Park as part of the Holland Oz Project. It’ll direct visitors to a living mosaic book that’s been constructed out of plants and flowers in a tribute to the L. Frank Baum novel and classic 1939 film. The outdoor exhibit in western Michigan will also include life-sized bronze sculptures of characters that Dorothy met along her journey through the whimsical world of Oz. The sculptures will be installed in August. The city has collaborated with the Holland Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Holland in Bloom and the Herrick District Library to bring the project to life.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnetonka: A local dog rescue organization says it’s saving the lives of golden retrievers by flying them to the U.S. from China, where they’re used in the dog meat trade. KARE-TV reports that Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest says its volunteers in China take in dogs that have been rescued from butchers and slaughterhouses. The Minnetonka-based group says its Chinese shelters can house hundreds of rescued dogs at a time. Humane Society International estimates that 10 million dogs are consumed each year in China. RAGOM board member Nicole Stundzia says a volunteer family recently traveled to the country to bring five golden retrievers to the U.S. Stundzia says volunteers are limited in the number of dogs they can travel with. The group says such rescues are challenging and costly.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Supreme Court has changed the rules to say a person seeking to become a lawyer has to pass the bar exam within three attempts or will have to go back to law school for at least 12 semester hours before they can retake it. The rule change comes after the annual passage rate on the Mississippi Bar exam has dropped from 79% in 2014 to 48% last year. The rule change says an applicant has to successfully complete 12 additional semester hours of law school courses at an American Bar Association accredited law school on subjects covered by or skills necessary to pass the bar exam. After going back to law school and successfully completing the 12 hours or additional course work, an applicant will be permitted to take the bar exam one additional time, the state Supreme Court order says.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Area attorneys whose underwire bras had been setting off jail metal detectors can now see their clients without removing their lingerie for screening, but only if they agree to talk to their clients by phones separated by glass. KCUR-FM reports that the new protocol was announced Thursday, the same day nearly 100 defense attorneys signed an open letter complaining that the restrictions were making it difficult to represent inmates. Jackson County Department of Corrections Director Diana Turner described the option of allowing attorneys to have non-contact visits without clearing metal detectors as a “happy medium.” But it didn’t sit well with attorney Denise Kirby, who signed the open letter. She says the compromise shows a lack of understanding about what it takes to defend an inmate.\n\nMontana\n\nStevensville: Trumpeter swans have built a nest in a wildlife refuge that biologists hope will lead to the first offspring documented in the Bitterroot Valley following restoration efforts. The Ravalli Republic reports the large waterfowl couple constructed the nest on top of a muskrat lodge on a remote pond at the Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge. Refuge project leader Tom Reed says he discovered the nest in recent weeks. Reintroduction efforts began decades ago after the swan population was decimated by hunters and feather collectors. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes wildlife director Dale Becker says 60 trumpeter young were recorded from about 18 nests in Montana last year. He says the young usually appear right after Memorial Day, but this year they’re a bit late.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials in the eastern part of the state are taking steps to control mosquito populations that carry West Nile and other diseases as a wet spring has led to more breeding grounds for the biting insects. The Douglas County Health Department says it’s using mosquito larvicide in potential breeding sites or stagnant waterways to help curb the spread of West Nile virus. The department is also trapping mosquitoes every other week. Trapped mosquitoes are counted and tested for Zika, West Nile virus and chikungunya at the state public health lab. The department also has begun collecting dead birds – including crows, black-billed magpies and blue jays – to test them for West Nile virus. Nebraska reported a nation-high 245 West Nile cases in humans last year, including 11 deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Lawmakers have agreed to let voters decide next year whether to amend the state Constitution to recognize same-sex marriages, add a voters’ bill of rights and overhaul the state board of pardons. The measures are among a handful of proposed changes to Nevada’s Constitution that lawmakers took on during their legislative session this year. As in most states, it isn’t easy to amend Nevada’s Constitution. Changes can either come from a citizen-driven ballot initiative, which would need to be approved by voters twice, or from the Legislature. Any proposal from lawmakers to amend the Constitution must be approved by the Legislature two sessions in a row and then approved by voters on the ballot. The state Constitution currently includes an unenforceable ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state would join more than a dozen counterparts requiring insurance coverage of fertility treatments under a bill that passed the House. Supporters of the bill said the requirement would help the state attract young families as its population ages. They said they heard from many couples who said they work in Massachusetts in order to obtain coverage. Opponents said they were concerned about the impact such a mandate would have on insurance premiums for small businesses. The House passed the bill and sent it back to the Senate, which previously passed a different version.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander, rock band The Smithereens, rocker Southside Johnny Lyon, New York Giants Harry Carson and Bart Oates, and legendary basketball player and coach Anne Donovan are among this year’s inductees to the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the winners of the Hall’s 11th class Monday at a ceremony at Newark Liberty International Airport. They include “Jaws” author Peter Benchley of Pennington, longtime Star-Ledger sport columnist Jerry Izenberg of Neptune and “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin of Bayonne. Other winners include Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez of Old Bridge, Hoboken teachers activist Elizabeth Allen, and Newark cardiac surgeon Victor Parsonnet. The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 27 in Asbury Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest city is the latest to embark on upgrades to its portion of the historic Route 66 Highway. Officials in Albuquerque want to see improvements to a barren stretch of Route 66 in an area that some complain is a forgotten part of the city, KRQE-TV reports. City officials are eyeing a $2.3 million plan that would add medians, landscaping and lighting along the Mother Road west of downtown. Currently, there are no sidewalks, landscaping or bike lanes and very few streetlights. Albuquerque has the largest part of Route 66 in an urban area. The move comes as an endangered federal program that has helped preserve the historic Route 66 Highway for two decades is set to end, and federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail remains stalled in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The creators of the High Line park turned a disused rail line into an urban oasis, art showcase and tourism magnet that welcomes 8 million visitors a year. The park is now marking two milestones. Its final section opened Wednesday, days before the 10th anniversary Sunday of the opening of the first section on June 9, 2009. The elevated rail line was built in the 1930s to raise freight trains above street level. Efforts to preserve the line started in the 1980s, after the trains stopped running. The blocks surrounding the High Line then were largely undeveloped and considered dangerous by some. Anthony Annaruma remembers the area when it was frequented by sex workers. Now, he’s working on a new building where apartments will sell for millions of dollars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBrevard: The General Assembly is looking to impose stricter guidelines on zip lines and high ropes courses after some deaths in the state. A bill before the North Carolina Senate seeks greater oversight of the “aerial adventure course” industry, just in time for summer camp season. But some camp owners say they feel the law could increase expenses and paperwork and force some operations to close altogether. Some course owners also questioned whether safety would improve. The bill is known as Sanders’ Law, named for 12-year-old Sanders Burney, who died in 2015 when her harness snapped during a zip line accident at a YMCA camp.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Salem: A mud run is expected to draw hundreds of people for good, dirty fun in western North Dakota. Medieval Rush will be held Saturday in New Salem. It’s billed as the longest mud run in North Dakota, at 3.2 miles. The event has a medieval theme and runs rain or shine. Gates open under the big cow statue “Salem Sue” at 9 a.m. Opening ceremonies are set for at 11 a.m. This year’s event also will add a medieval dirt bike race through the mud. Participants must be at least 14 years old. The Bismarck Tribune reports about 700 people take part each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A new interactive exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is set to open next month. Cleveland.com reports that the “Interactive Garage” exhibit opening July 1 will enable visitors to play instruments on their own or with friends or strangers at the museum. Visitors can get help with instruments from trained professionals on site. Rock Hall president and CEO Greg Harris said earlier this year that the museum has been working to create a more immersive, hands-on experience for visitors. The exhibit opens July 1 and will take up the entire second floor of the museum. It will include keyboards, mixing boards, guitars, drums, studio space and a lounge for playing acoustic instruments.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University are jointly developing drone technology to more accurately forecast the weather. The Journal Record reports that OU School of Meteorology professor Phil Chilson says he launched the project in 2008, and it received a boost of National Science Foundation funding in 2015. Chilson said a “long-recognized lack of observation” in the bottom 2 miles of the atmosphere hinders storm forecasting. OSU is building the drones, and OU is focusing on the meteorology portion, which includes what type of information and equipment is required for the unmanned aircraft. Both schools are working through regulatory concerns with the Federal Aviation Administration. OSU professor Jamey Jacob says the development of drones for more accurate storm prediction will cause a “paradigm shift.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two protesters have been sentenced to five days in jail for throwing horse lubricant mixed with gold glitter on two police officers at a protest. The Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office says the defendants were protesting against a rally organized by a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer when the officers asked to see what was in two 4-gallon buckets they were carrying. Prosecutors say Robert Majure and Tristan Romine-Mann instead sprayed the slimy liquid on the officers and ran. Prosecutors say the two attempted to “fist bump” in celebration after they were arrested and cuffed in a patrol car. A jury convicted them of harassment and acquitted them of a charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDeer Lake: The rustic training camp where Muhammad Ali prepared for some of his most famous fights has undergone an elaborate restoration and opened to the public Saturday as a shrine to the heavyweight icon’s life and career. The famed Deer Lake camp was in disrepair when California real estate investor Mike Madden, son of retired broadcaster and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden, bought it shortly after Ali died in June 2016 at age 74. Ali bought the wooded, out-of-the-way property about 90 miles from Philadelphia in 1972 and installed 18 primarily log buildings, including a gym, dining hall, small mosque, visitors’ cabins and a horse barn. It was at Deer Lake where Ali prepared for his epic bouts against George Foreman and Joe Frazier, attracting crowds who watched him work. He trained at the camp until his last fight in 1981.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is using a sensory tool to help the public understand what it’s like to live with dementia. CCRI bought an instructional program known as the Virtual Dementia Tour with help from the state. For the first time, it’s offering free demonstrations to the public. The demonstrations will be held Tuesday at the Lincoln campus, June 18 at the Providence campus, June 21 at the Warwick campus and June 25 at the Newport campus. The demonstrations, facilitated by CCRI nursing staff, take about half an hour. Registration is required in advance. CCRI says it’s the only college in the state to offer this technology, and it’s trying to do more to help caregivers and health care professionals understand how to treat people with dementia.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state has passed a new law that bars protein grown in a laboratory via stem cells from being advertised as “meat.” Primary sponsor Republican Rep. Randy Ligon of Chester says he didn’t want people to confuse lab-grown protein with the real thing. The lawmaker and member of the South Carolina Cattlemen’s Association told The Post and Courier of Charleston he doesn’t want to stop research into the alternative food, but he does want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting. The bill passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last month. Lab-grown meat hasn’t made it into stores yet, but federal agencies have announced how they will regulate the industry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Native American woman is bringing attention to the impact of methamphetamine addiction from within the South Dakota Women’s Prison. Heather Shooter, 37, started the support group Sober is Sacred to encourage other inmates to join the fight to demand more drug treatment services at the Pierre facility. Within the past year, the group has put on two anti-meth rallies at the women’s prison, where many inmates share stories about how the drug derailed their lives. About 64% of women in the prison are incarcerated on a primary drug charge, most of which involved meth. Shooter has been in prison since April 2017 for participating in a high-speed police chase with her 6-year-old in the car while high on meth. “That was my wake-up call,” she said. “This is my chance to change.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Promise scholars can fulfill their community service requirement during a volunteer event in state parks this month. According to a news release, 54 of the state’s 56 parks will be offering a volunteer event. Most of those will take place Saturday, June 22. Work projects include landscaping, invasive plant removal, litter pickup and trail maintenance. Tennessee Promise provides scholarships for eligible students to attend state community and technical colleges for free. Students must complete eight hours of community service. The deadline to complete the service this year is July 1. Details of Tennessee Promise Saturday events are available on the state parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Zoo’s new Texas Wetlands Exhibit showcases some whooping cranes that were relocated from Maryland after their federally funded habitat closed last year. The Houston Chronicle reports that the $20 million Texas complex, which opened in late May, is the first of four exhibits being built to mark the zoo’s 100th anniversary in 2022. The cranes are among three species featured in the exhibit. The other two are American alligators and bald eagles, and all three are native to Texas. At one time, all were nearing extinction. Zoo CEO Lee Ehmke says that the goal is to make the new exhibit engaging and genuine, for both visitors and animals. Whooping cranes have been listed as endangered since 1967.\n\nUtah\n\nMapleton: A woman in Utah County is celebrating 15 years rehabilitating wildlife in her backyard. The Daily Herald reports Patti Richards rescues hundreds of birds each year, including falcons, eagles, hawks and talking crows. Richards said she channeled her passion for birds and bears into starting the Great Basin Wildlife Rescue out of her home. The rescue has also taken in bobcats and foxes. Richards said the majority of the birds are released back into their natural habitat once they’ve recovered from their injury or illness, but some are relocated to zoos and animal facilities throughout the country. The rescue is also home to several education birds who work at schools, memorials and fundraisers. Richards said the rescue has received a lot of community support that has helped it continue to thrive.\n\nVermont\n\nWhite River Junction: The state attorney general’s office says a second forum for a hate-free Vermont is being held this week in White River Junction. The office says the event was organizated in conjunction with the Vermont NAACP, the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, and others. Organizers say the purpose is to generate community conversation about bias incidents and hate crimes in Vermont. The moderator says the series “is intended to take the pulse of Vermonters’ experience of discrimination” and to bring together policymakers and community members to discuss the issues. Community members are encouraged to tell their stories. The event takes place Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Hartford High School.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: He was known as the man Norfolk never forgave. David Farragut, the U.S. Navy’s very first admiral and a major player in Union Navy operations during the Civil War, called Norfolk home before the war. But when Virginia seceded from the Union, his loyalty to the United States led him to flee north and continue to serve with the Union Navy – a “betrayal” that residents of this Southern city didn’t forget, The Virginian-Pilot reports. In 2016, more than 150 years after the war’s end, Norfolk named a quarter-acre pocket park in Freemason after Farragut. The park, essentially a small lawn and dog park, was dedicated in May. The park’s name stands out in Norfolk history and is perhaps indicative of a shifting attitude: Many public spaces and buildings in the city bear the names of Confederate military men. Farragut’s park is the first to recognize a Union officer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Skagit County officials estimate the growing elk population in the region is costing farmers $1.4 million a year. The Skagit Valley Herald reports that figure is slightly down from the $1.5 million estimate released in January. The new estimate by the Skagit County Assessor’s Office is based on 140 survey responses from farmers involved in a state program that offers tax benefits to keep farms in production. In survey responses, damage to fences and crops were listed as the top issues. Assessor Dave Thomas says the average for farms reporting elk damage was $13,000. Individual damages were as high was $150,000. Rural property owners have complained about damages as the North Cascades – or Nooksack – elk herd has grown in recent years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMinden: Thirty years after residents marched to bring attention to the PCB contamination causing cancer in their community, members of Minden Community Action say more work must be done. The Register-Herald reports the group organized a Saturday march as a re-enactment of a 1989 march for the contaminated Fayette County community. The march aimed to draw attention to ongoing problems and also honor local residents who pushed the federal government to act. Minden was contaminated after workers at the now-defunct Shaffer’s Equipment Co. dumped the carcinogenic industrial chemical PCB around the town. There have been three cleanup efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and none has fully removed the contamination.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State agriculture officials are concerned farmers will be tempted by quick access loans and credit cards as many take on more debt this year. Frank Friar, an economic development specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, tells Wisconsin Public Radio the state agency is worried farmers may turn to predatory lending agencies after years of low crop prices. The American Farm Bureau Federation warns that farm debt is at a record high, lending standards are tightening, and the cost of credit is rising. Katie Wantoch, an agriculture agent with the University of Wisconsin-Extension, says farmers in debt may also spend more on their credit cards, which will likely worsen their financial situation. Wantoch says there may be more fees they didn’t anticipate.\n\nWyoming\n\nPine Bluffs: Roman Catholics from the region have marked the 20th anniversary of a shrine featuring one of the largest concrete sculptures in the U.S. A 30-foot sculpture of the Virgin Mary stands at the center of the Our Lady of Peace Shrine outside Pine Bluffs in southeast Wyoming. It’s the largest sculpture in the state. Nearby at the shrine are 14 carvings representing the Stations of the Cross, a series of events in the life of Jesus. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports a Mass and devotional prayers took place at the shrine Saturday. Ted and Marjorie Trefren of Cheyenne built the shrine in 1999 after touring shrines in Europe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/24/opinions/unmasking-american-opinion-column-galant/index.html", "title": "Opinion: What's revealed when Americans take off their masks | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen the celebrity inside the Jack in the Box costume was revealed Wednesday on the Fox show “The Masked Singer,” he wasn’t Joe Pesci, Robert Duvall, Elon Musk or Al Roker, as the judges had guessed.\n\nInstead, to the consternation of many including some of the judges, the man who sang the 1982 hit “Bad to the Bone” was former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in the news most recently for his extreme efforts to support former President Donald Trump’s false election fraud narrative. As the Daily Beast asked, “What did we do to deserve this?”\n\nThe farcical moment punctuated a week of unmasking — not just on the show, but across the country.\n\nProtection was the goal in January 2021 when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced masks would be required for passengers on airplanes and public transit. But on Monday, soon after a federal judge struck down the transportation mask mandate, airlines dropped their requirements and many passengers dropped their masks.\n\nThose strips of fabric helped protect millions of passengers from Covid-19, but they couldn’t mask the divisions in America that seem wider than ever in the third year of the pandemic. Instead masks have become cultural symbols and personal statements that loom large in a country where lockdowns have loosened the personal ties between us.\n\nThat the decision against the mask mandate came from a federal judge in Florida who was appointed by Trump — and rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association — wasn’t lost on critics of the ruling.\n\nDistrict Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle’s decision, Jill Filipovic wrote, “seems to usurp public health guidance while failing to understand science or the English language. The federal government, she held, is only authorized to deal with issues concerning ‘sanitation,’ which she determined is limited to ‘measures that clean something.’ Because wearing a mask doesn’t clean anything, she wrote, mask mandates are beyond the scope of the government’s authority.”\n\n“All of this is incredibly dangerous: A right-wing judge doesn’t like a government regulation, and so she voids it on incredibly specious grounds,” Filipovic wrote.\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nInfectious disease expert Dr. Kent Sepkowitz argued that it would be prudent to keep the mask mandate in place given the continued spread of the coronavirus but also noted the tension it causes in the air. On a plane, he wrote, “Nothing is private; everything is shared — even the filtered air. Out of deference to those around us, we stifle our whining to airline staff, minimize our scoots past neighbors for a stroll in the aisle, resist doing jumping jacks or — most especially — try our very best to avoid coughing, because all of this can affect others in our little inescapable airplane community.”\n\n“This communal living, however brief, is unpleasant for everyone. Adding to it a mask mandate… appears to have tipped a segment of the ‘I am the boss of me; government be gone!’ zealots of the mask and vaccine resistance into a fierce, and even violent, uncivil disobedience. The trend is bad enough to have caught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration and, for some particularly unruly passengers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation… the FAA had 1,150 reports of unruly passengers, from which 744 were related to mask-wearing.”\n\nDave Whamond/Cagle Cartoons\n\nSome experts question how effective the mask mandates really are. In The New York Times, David Leonhardt wrote, “Unfortunately, the U.S. has spent much of the past two years with the worst of all worlds on masks. People have been required to wear them for hours on end, causing frustration and exhaustion and exacerbating political polarization. Yet the rules have included enough exceptions to let Covid spread anyway. The burden of the mandates has been relatively high, while the benefits have been relatively low. It’s the opposite of what a successful public health campaign typically does.”\n\nStates on the offensive\n\nIn high school, Danielle McLean played on the boys varsity hockey team. Weakened by chemotherapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, McLean wrote, “I could only last a single, one-minute shift during each three-period game before the muscles in my legs began to feel as if they were pushing through my skin,” she wrote. “But during those brief few minutes of playing time, I felt free, whole — as if my troubles did not exist.”\n\nWhen McLean began transitioning from male to female as an adult, many childhood friends rejected her. But she found welcome on a local women’s hockey team. “Most of them knew that I was trans, but didn’t care. They accepted me as one of their own. For whatever reason —perhaps because our connection was not anchored in superficial ideals of masculinity — they loved me for me… I’ve gone to teammates’ weddings and baby showers and supported them through some of the hardest moments of their lives.”\n\nMcLean has watched with dismay as politicians in Florida and other states have stoked anxiety about gender transitions with laws “banning trans athletes from participating in sports teams consistent with their gender identity. These laws really only target young trans kids in school who are looking to express themselves, play sports with their friends or who like me, escape their anxieties through competition.”\n\nAllison Hope wrote that “while attacks on our community are sadly nothing new, this current environment, in which public officials use dangerous rhetoric while peddling bills that discriminate against us, feels ever more fraught. It doesn’t help that some Republicans are increasingly perpetuating the harmful myth that liberals and members of the LGBTQ community are grooming children – a move that shatters any illusions that the US has become fully understanding and accepting of our LGBTQ lives and experiences.”\n\nAt the behest of Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida legislature last week voted to strip Disney of its ability to exercise governmental powers in the area surrounding its theme parks. The move came in retaliation for the company’s opposition to the new law limiting what can be taught in schools about gender and sexual orientation. The move is “more than just a slimy and indefensible rearguard effort to punish a private company for violating GOP orthodoxy,” Greg Sargent wrote in The Washington Post.\n\nIt points “to a potential future Republican Party that envisions an expanded use of state power to fight the culture wars in a much broader and more pernicious sense.”\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\nDeSantis’ move against Disney was a “political masterstroke,” according to Henry Olsen, also writing for The Washington Post. It enlists support both from the GOP’s base, which is animated by cultural issues and from libertarians who oppose giving Disney special privileges.\n\nIf big business “prioritizes cultural stances, it should expect to methodically be driven out of the GOP coalition,” wrote Olsen. “But joining the Democrats means it will be locked in constant warfare with that party’s growing progressive wing. Trying to play the two sides against one another will likely antagonize both parties’ vocal activists and leave business with no friends to defend it when the chips are down. Thus, big business must increasingly decide what it cares more about: its culture or its profits.”\n\nFor more on the politics of state actions:\n\nJames Moore: Abbott’s border policies are nothing more than a stunt\n\nDavid Daley: Gerrymandering on steroids is the new normal\n\nDemocracy under siege\n\nPat Byrnes/Cagle Cartoons\n\nFlorida also made news last week for the state Education Department’s rejection of dozens of math textbooks which it claimed touched on prohibited topics such as critical race theory.\n\nIn an editorial, the Palm Beach Post said the state had failed to back up its case that the textbooks weren’t appropriate: “In an increasingly complex and diverse world, Florida’s schoolchildren deserve the best educational material possible, not one filtered through a particular political dogma. Unfortunately, in trying to ‘own the libs,’ state leaders are shortchanging students.”\n\nBut in the long run, the more significant action came in the state legislature, which passed “DeSantis’s proposed congressional map that would add four seats likely to go to Republicans, do away with districts now represented by two of the state’s Black US House members and potentially prompt a federal court challenge to the Voting Rights Act,” as Peniel E. Joseph noted.\n\n“How are we to claim to be the world’s more important and enduring democracy around the world and yet fail to safeguard the sacred right to vote for our citizens at home? We can start by choosing country over party and passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.”\n\nDemocrats may not have the votes to pass the bill in Congress yet, Joseph noted, but they “should remind voters at every opportunity of what is at stake on the ballot during the upcoming midterms. Republicans who are good faith political actors (in contrast to bad faith political actors who celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday while refusing to support voting rights) should join together with Democrats to pursue a halt to voter suppression.”\n\nThe May 9 factor\n\nMay 9 is “Victory Day” in Russia, an occasion for military parades and the commemoration of Nazi Germany’s surrender in 1945. As Frida Ghitis noted, “US intelligence assessments, Russian foreign policy analysts and common sense all indicate that (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin will use May 9 as a sort of self-imposed deadline in Ukraine. It’s not a deadline to win the war — that will likely not happen by then – but to pretend Russia has won something. Something major. Something important.”\n\nThere’s no end in sight to the horrific combat in the Donbas region, the section of eastern Ukraine where Russia has been waging war for the last eight years — and has seen increased fighting since Putin’s troops abandoned their attempt to encircle Kyiv.\n\n“That’s where Putin will seek a face-saving success, a concrete victory he can take to the Russian people to tell them he is still the larger-than-life leader whose ‘special military operation,’ with all the hardship it is causing for Russians — let alone the calamity it is inflicting on Ukraine — has been worth the price tag. Unfortunately, his desperation for a win likely means that the next three weeks are sure to bring even worse death and destruction to Ukraine.”\n\nFor more:\n\nJeffrey Sachs: A negotiated peace is the only way to end Russia’s war on Ukraine\n\nAaron David Miller: Why the world fails on the ‘Never again’ pledge\n\nTraffic stops and shootings\n\nPatrick Lyoya was shot dead by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, police officer during a traffic stop earlier this month. The 26-year-old was pulled over for improper registration, authorities said, and a physical encounter broke out between the two.\n\n“As much as many Americans grieve for the snuffing out of Lyoya’s life,” Issac Bailey wrote, “all of this is so ordinary, so standard, that most of us never consider how absurd a practice it is for traffic violations to be the purview of police with guns. We continue that practice even though it’s a logical conclusion that unarmed traffic personnel and technology can handle many such things quite well without increasing the chances for bloodshed and death.”\n\nBailey noted that a New York Times investigation “found that over the past five years, police officers have killed at least 400 drivers or passengers who were wielding neither a gun nor knife and weren’t suspected of having committed a violent crime. According to the Times, they had been pulled over for things such as swerving across double yellow lines.”\n\n“I drive on toll roads in North Carolina. They send me a bill in the mail 30 days later. No one armed with a Glock and Taser and baton has to be involved to ensure I’d pay what I owe. From red light cameras to robots to unarmed human traffic enforcement, we have a variety of mechanisms that could perhaps have been used by (or in place of) that unnamed officer in Grand Rapids.”\n\nWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content Agency\n\n2020 and 2024\n\nOn the surface, Trump lords over the Republican Party, granting audiences and dispensing much-coveted endorsements from his Mar-a-Lago base. But the full picture is much more complicated — and this week the depth of the private discontent among GOP leaders became clearer.\n\nIn the days following the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol, according to a book by New York Times reporters Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately expressed outrage at Trump’s role in fueling the election lie that set the stage for the violence that followed. As Julian Zelizer noted, McConnell said, “If this isn’t impeachable, I don’t know what is,” according to the Times.\n\n“Both McCarthy and McConnell, of course, voted to acquit Trump of inciting an insurrection when the former President was impeached for the second time,” Zelizer observed. “This refusal to hold Trump accountable, and the pressure both McCarthy and McConnell felt to take this stance, reveals just how far the Republican Party has shifted in recent decades.”\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n“Even something as dramatic as a full-scale attack on a presidential election, coupled with a violent attack on Congress, is not enough to break the rank partisanship we’ve seen from Republicans. It’s clear from their actions that the political strength of the party supersedes all else, even the health of our democratic institutions.”\n\nMichael D’Antonio noted that Trump’s rally crowds are growing sparser and more Republicans are speaking out. “Frank Luntz, a longtime GOP pollster, said in a recent interview that many Republicans are laughing at… Trump in private. ‘They won’t say it, but behind his back, they think he’s a child. …Trump isn’t the same man he was a year ago. Even many Republicans are tired of going back and rehashing the 2020 election,’ Luntz told the Daily Beast.”\n\nAt the same time, his potential rival in the 2024 race, President Joe Biden, has endured several months of dismal approval ratings that are about as low the ones Trump logged during his presidency. Biden’s central problem: Inflation continues at levels that are the highest in decades. And Jason Furman, an economist who chaired President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote for Project Syndicate that strong consumer demand is driving prices up, and “we should expect high inflation to stay with us for some time.”\n\nBob Gorrell/Creators Syndicate\n\nFor more:\n\nSE Cupp video: This GOPer could be a spoiler in a Republican presidential primary\n\nThe plight of ‘The First Lady’\n\nRamona Rosales/SHOWTIME\n\nA new Showtime series tells the stories of three first ladies — Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama — through the performances of actors Gillian Anderson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Viola Davis.\n\n“All three chafe at the central contradiction of the role, one that ushers them to the center of national power not through their achievements but through their husbands’, offering new avenues of influence while strictly policing how they use that influence,” wrote Nicole Hemmer.\n\nIn “The First Lady,” Roosevelt rejects the notion that the role is actually a job, even though she would be the first to leverage the role for real political influence. The question remains, though, whether it should be a job. While first ladies have at times used the office to do meaningful work, the idea that presidential spouses are required to spend most of their time as glorified hosts seems increasingly out of touch.”\n\n“The women in ‘The First Lady’ make the most of their circumstances, but the show is a reminder that they may have been better served by not being forced into those circumstances in the first place.”\n\nEarth Day\n\nJoel Pett/Tribune Content Agency\n\nWhen he wasn’t hunting wild game, Theodore Roosevelt was a pioneering conservationist. As President, “Roosevelt established 150 national forests and five national parks — and protected over 230 million acres of public land,” his great-great grandson John Palfrey wrote.\n\n“But Roosevelt, and many others in the conservation movement, did not do enough to protect the Earth with equity in mind. These White leaders failed to recognize the extraordinary role that Indigenous people played in protecting and nurturing our planet.”\n\nPalfrey, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, added that, “Climate justice means recognizing and addressing the fact that marginalized communities will feel — and have already felt — the worst impacts of climate change. We must make sure that those who face these effects are in positions of power, where they are able to make decisions for their own communities and to contribute to research and creative solutions.”\n\nFor more:\n\nKathleen Rogers: If we want to solve climate change, businesses need to invest in our planet\n\nDon’t miss\n\nJeff Yang: This movie’s Asian American metaphor is a message to the not-so United States\n\nDean Obeidallah: On Tax Day, the rich’s failure to pay fair share of taxes stinks worse than Elon Musk’s Twitter bid\n\nRim-Sarah Alouane: In France, the far-right has already won\n\nZoe Jacoby and Reshma Ramachandran: What we owe new mothers\n\nWazhma Frogh: Locked out of classrooms, Afghan girls are taking drastic measures\n\nScott Galloway: The most dangerous person in the world is a young man who’s broke and alone\n\nSally Hayden: UK deal with Rwanda dashes migrants’ hopes\n\nAND…\n\nThe Northman\n\nAidan Monaghan/Focus Features\n\nWilliam Shakespeare died 406 years ago, but his life and work remain an inexhaustible source for everything cultural we consume today, from “Game of Thrones” to this weekend’s new movie, “The Northman.”\n\nAs Jeffrey R. Wilson wrote, “The film — with an all-star cast that includes Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk and Willem Dafoe — is an adaptation of one of Shakespeare’s sources, the legend of Amleth in the medieval historian Saxo Grammaticus’ ‘History of the Danes.’ ‘The Northman’ overleaps ‘Hamlet.’”\n\n“‘The Northman’ is a Shakespherean adaptation — note the spelling — a retelling inspired by materials that aren’t Shakespeare’s texts but are widely known today in relation to Shakespeare.”\n\nA prime example, according to Wilson: Stephen Spielberg’s “West Side Story.” “That’s a 2021 remake of a 1961 film adaptation of a 1957 stage adaptation of Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ which was a 1595 stage adaptation of a 1562 English poem that translated a 1560 French translation of a 1535 Italian novella. Where ‘The Northman’ elides Shakespeare’s text, ‘West Side Story’ is a refraction of adaptations.”\n\n“Shakespherean adaptations call us beyond expressions of personal taste into understandings of how we got here.”", "authors": ["Richard Galant"], "publish_date": "2022/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/09/16/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria-timeline/75253009007/", "title": "Boar's Head listeria outbreak timeline: Deaths, factory closure and ...", "text": "AI-assisted summary The outbreak resulted in 61 illnesses, 60 hospitalizations, and 10 deaths across 19 states.\n\nThe outbreak was linked to contaminated products from the company's Jarratt, Virginia plant, which has since been permanently closed.\n\nA USDA investigation into the outbreak and the agency's handling of the situation is ongoing.\n\nThe deadly multi-state listeria outbreak attributed to Boar's Head deli meat has officially been declared \"over\" by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe agency issued its final update on the case on Thursday, saying a total of 61 people across 19 states became ill in the outbreak, resulting in 60 hospitalizations and 10 deaths.\n\nWhile the outbreak is considered \"over,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigation and several lawsuits lodged against the company are still underway.\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Sen.

The agency the CDC reported 28 cases of illness across 12 states, including one death each in Illinois and New Jersey, and one sick pregnant person.\n\nInitially, the agency said the outbreak appeared to be associated with meats sliced at deli counters but did not have further information on the source.\n\nJuly 26: Boar's Head announces liverwurst recall; CDC update\n\nBoar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. issued a recall for more than 207,528 pounds of product, including all of its liverwurst products, due to potential listeria contamination.\n\nThe recalled ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024 and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life. The products were distributed to retail deli locations nationwide and were labeled with the establishment number “EST. 12612.\"\n\nBoar's Head recalled additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst, including ready-to-eat deli meat with establishment number “EST. 12612.” produced on June 27, 20424.\n\nThe same day, the CDC released updated information, reporting 34 illnesses linked to the outbreak across 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths.\n\nJuly 26: First lawsuit filed\n\nA Missouri couple, represented by Law firm OFT Food Safety & Injury Lawyers, filed a lawsuit in St. Louis Circuit Court against Boar's Head Provisions, Co., Inc. and Schnucks Markets, Inc.\n\nThe complaint said that Patrick and Sue Fleming bought Boar's Head liverwurst from their local Schnucks grocery store in June, resulting in a \"life-threatening listeria infection\" for Sue Fleming, 88.\n\nThe lawsuit said that Fleming spent nine days in the hospital receiving “intensive treatment” before being transferred to a rehabilitation center, where she spent another 11 days. Court documents said the couple suffered damages tied to the cost of medical treatment and other hardships, and accused the companies of negligence.\n\nJuly 30: Boar's Head expands recall\n\nBoar's Head expanded its recall to all products produced at the Jarratt, Virginia plant where the contaminated liverwurst originated.\n\nThe expanded recall added 7 million pounds of meat and poultry products ranging from beef, bologna, ham, liverwurst and salami, among others. Now totaling 71 Boar’s Head and Old Country products made between May 10 and July 29, the recall swelled to cover about 7.2 million pounds.\n\nJuly 31: CDC update\n\nCDC issued an update along with the Boar's Head recall, still reporting 43 illnesses including one death.\n\nAugust 1: Class action lawsuit filed in New York\n\nA potential class action lawsuit against Boar’s Head Provisions was filed in federal court in New York, accusing the company of “improperly, deceptively, and misleadingly labeled and marketed its products,” by failing the full extent of possible contamination by Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nRita Torres alleged n the lawsuit that she and other “reasonable customers” would not have purchased Boar's Head liverwurst and other products had the company properly warned consumers about possible bacterial contamination. The suit called the initial July 26 recall insufficient and “deliberately designed to preclude the vast majority of customers from receiving a recall.”\n\nAugust 7: Pregnant victim files lawsuit\n\nA pregnant woman from Minnesota \"who nearly lost her unborn child\" filed a lawsuit against Boar's Head after she was infected by listeria from eating the company's deli meat sold at a Florida Publix, said OFT Food Safety & Injury Lawyers.\n\nThe woman's lawyers say she was 36 weeks pregnant when she was sickened with contaminated meat, became severely ill and was hospitalized for six days.\n\nIn an updated statement at the time, Boar's Head said they \"deeply regret\" the contamination.\n\n\"No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for the families that have suffered losses and others who endured illness,\" the company said.\n\nAugust 8: CDC increases number of dead and sick\n\nThe CDC released an update on the investigation, reporting 43 people infected and hospitalized across 13 states, including three total deaths in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nThe CDC also confirmed the epidemiology of the outbreak and tied it to Boar's Head liverwurst.\n\nAugust 20: Most recent CDC update\n\nJust 12 days later, new numbers from the CDC reflected six more deaths and 14 new hospitalizations across 18 total states. This brought the number of deaths up to a total of nine, and illnesses and hospitalizations up to 57.\n\nOf the six new deaths, one occurred in Florida, one in Tennessee, one in New Mexico, one in New York and two in South Carolina. Infections also appeared in five additional states since the early August update, including Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nThese are the latest numbers the CDC has provided in the investigation.\n\nAugust 29: Boar's Head inspection records are released\n\nCopies of reports filed between 2023 and 2024 by inspectors with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) were obtained by USA TODAY through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe records showed 69 reports of \"noncompliance\" at the Jarratt, Virginia plant, including reports of insects live and dead, black and green mold, mildew, dripping and standing water, and other unsanitary conditions within the plant in the weeks leading up to the July recall.\n\nLater more FSIS records were released dating back to January 2022, including reports of leaks and condensation dripping over areas with product, \"sludge,\" \"black smudges,\" \"slimy\" materials and other residues found on machines and in several rooms across the facility, \"putrid,\" \"off\" odors, \"thick and flaking rust\" in several locations, including above production lines. Dirt, screws and trash were seen strewn on the floor of production areas.\n\nAugust 30: First wrongful death lawsuit filed\n\nThe first wrongful death lawsuit was filed against Boar's Head on behalf of the family of an 88-year-old Virginia grandfather, master hairstylist and Holocaust survivor who died after eating contaminated liverwurst.\n\nFiled in Sarasota, Florida, the suit explained that Morgenstein purchased later-recalled Boar's Head liverwurst on June 30, 2024, from his local Harris Teeter store and became ill after consuming it.\n\nHe was hospitalized on July 8 and was later found to be suffering from sepsis and listeriosis that was later traced by to Boar's Head meat by the CDC. Despite \"aggressive measures,\" he died on July 18 surrounded by his wife of 50 years and his son Garshon, who USA TODAY previously spoke to about his father's life and legacy.\n\nBoar's Head issued the following response to USA TODAY: \"We deeply regret the impact this recall has had on affected families. No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for those who have suffered losses or endured illness.\n\nSeptember 6: Multi-million dollar lawsuit hits Boar's Head\n\nA new multi-million dollar lawsuit is filed by food safety attorney Bill Marler on behalf of Virginia resident Barbara Schmidt.\n\nThe suit alleged that Schmidt consumed Boar's Head liverwurst and subsequently became so ill, that she was admitted to the hospital and spent weeks there, including at least six days in the intensive care unit undergoing \"invasive procedures that were necessary to save her life,\" and then rehab for roughly 10 days.\n\nPublic health officials determined that Schmidt had not only suffered a listeria infection but it was caused by the Boar's Head outbreak, court documents said. Accusing Boar's Head of multiple counts of negligence, fraudulent concealment and breach of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, the lawsuit sought $1 million in compensatory damages, as well as $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nSeptember 13: Boar's Head announces closure of Jarratt, Virginia plant\n\nBoar's Head announced the Jarratt, Virginia Boar's Head plant linked to the ongoing outbreak was closing permanently.\n\nAbout 500 union workers will be impacted by the closing, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union spokesman Jonathan Williams told USA TODAY. Additional employees in management were likely affected, too, but he was unsure how many were impacted, he said.\n\n\"Given the seriousness of the outbreak, and the fact that it originated at Jarratt, we have made the difficult decision to indefinitely close this location, which has not been operational since late July 2024,\" Boar's Head said in an email statement.\n\nThe company also said it would be permanently discontinuing its liverwurst products after investigations found the root cause of the contamination only existed at the Jarratt facility in the production of liverwurst.\n\nSeptember 27: Denial of Boar's Head listeria records raises questions\n\nUSA TODAY became aware of the legal investigation when FSIS denied multiple records requests related to the outbreak, citing an exemption that protects from the disclosure of “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.\"\n\nUnder this exemption, records and information can be withheld if they are compiled for law enforcement purposes and if their release could \"reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,\" said the denial letter.\n\n\"In my 31 years of dealing with (U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service), I've never gotten a response like this,\" said food safety attorney Bill Marler, who previously called for a congressional hearing into the situation. The investigation could be looking into the conduct of the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) inspectors, in addition to Boar's Head, he said.\n\nFSIS withheld nearly 400 pages of documents requested by USA TODAY, saying the premature release of included information could interfere with enforcement proceedings and \"hinder the government’s ability to further control and shape the investigation.\"\n\nOct. 15: Officials confirm an investigation is underway\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, later confirmed in an Oct. 15 news release that UDSA Inspector General Phyllis Fong is opening an investigation into how the agency handled the reports of \"noncompliances\" filed by inspectors with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) in the months prior to the listeria outbreak.\n\nBlumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, also a Connecticut Democrat, called on the USDA and Justice Department in September to strengthen USDA's listeria prevention protocols and to consider criminal charges against Boar's Head.\n\n“USDA took virtually no action – allowing Boar’s Head to continue business as usual at its chronically unsanitary Virginia plant – despite finding repeated serious violations,\" Blumenthal said in a statement. \"The Virginia plant should have been shut down years ago before people got sick or died from Listeria. The IG (Inspector General) investigation is a vital first step to assure accountability and prevent such deadly mistakes from happening again.”\n\nNov. 15: Boar's Head settles class action suit\n\nThe class action lawsuit filed by Rita Torres on behalf of multiple consumers was settled in November, according to court documents.\n\nIn documents filed Nov. 15, the attorneys representing consumers in this and four other related cases wrote to the court saying that a settlement had been reached between Boar's Head and the complaining parties. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed and the parties requested 60 days to finalize the details.\n\nNov. 21: The CDC declares the outbreak officially over\n\nThe CDC officially declared the \"over\" on Nov. 21.\n\nIn the agency's final update on the case, it said a total of 61 people across 19 states became ill in the outbreak, resulting in 60 hospitalizations and 10 deaths.\n\nBy Nov. 21, all of the products that were part of the outbreak were now past their shelf life, meaning they were unlikely to still be in consumers' fridges, and listeria outbreaks are generally considered \"over\" 60 days after the last reported illness, said the CDC.\n\nPeople who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system should still avoid deli meat or reheat it to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, or until steaming hot to kill any germs, the agency said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}]}

Now, experts are warning consumers to prepare for more price increases spurred by a new tariff on auto imports.\n\nStarting April 2, President Donald Trump is set to impose a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles, light trucks and some auto parts. For imported cars protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, only the foreign parts that make up the vehicle will be subject to the tariff.\n\n“We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth,” Trump said inside the Oval Office. He said the tariffs will \"spur growth like you haven’t seen before.”\n\nThe move follows a temporary tariff exemption granted earlier this month at the behest of three large U.S. automakers. After the monthlong reprieve, auto experts say higher prices are likely on the horizon.\n\n\"You're going to see price increases,\" said Ivan Drury, director of insights at automotive research site Edmunds. \"It's such a shotgun approach. Virtually nothing goes unscathed.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat auto tariffs mean for consumers\n\nIn a sales forecast call Wednesday, Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said massive increases in tariffs would be “highly disruptive” to North American vehicle production and could lead to tighter supply and higher prices.\n\n“By mid-April, we expect disruptions,” Smoke said. “We expect sales to fall, new and used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated if those tariffs persist.”\n\nDrury said price increases will probably vary. Some companies may pass price hikes from the 25% tariff directly to consumers, while others may bear some of the costs to remain competitive and ease cost pressures in other ways, such as reducing incentives.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nBut with the tariff expected to hit both imported vehicles and key auto parts like engines and transmissions, Drury said consumers can expect price increases \"across the board.\" That includes new cars, used cars, maintenance costs and even insurance premiums, because accidents involving new parts would be more costly.\n\nCars assembled in the U.S. wouldn't be safe from tariffs either, Drury said, because they import parts from other countries.\n\n\"There is no vehicle that is 100% American in that regard,\" Drury said. Used vehicles will see \"a bit more lag time, but there will be an effect.\"\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said questions remain on exactly how these tariffs will be applied or whether they will be altered in the coming weeks. In their current form, he estimates they could push up the average car price $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the make and model.\n\nThe tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers,\" Ives said in a note Wednesday. But \"we continue to believe this is some form of negotiation and these tariffs could change.\"\n\nIf tariffs do hold, they could encourage increased investment in U.S. manufacturing and a more resilient auto industry, according to a note from Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. But those potential long-term benefits will take time.\n\n\"For consumers navigating higher prices in the short term, the promise of future gains may feel distant − at least for now,\" Caldwell said.\n\nHow much does a new car cost today?\n\nThe tariffs come shortly after pandemic-era supply chain disruptions pushed up car prices for U.S. drivers. New vehicle prices are up about 25% since early 2020, according to Kelley Blue Book, with the average transaction price for a new vehicle just above $48,000 as of February.\n\nMeanwhile, higher interest rates have pushed up auto loans, which makes affording a new vehicle “a real challenge for most households,” Erin Keating, executive analyst for Cox Automotive, said in a statement this month.\n\nAnother report from AAA found the cost the total cost to own and operate a new vehicle was roughly $1,025 a month in 2024, including expenses like maintenance, fuel, insurance, financing and depreciation.

But I will highlight that it means that the tariffs remain in place, and therefore our response will remain in place.\"\n\nLutnick emphasized that the reprieve would only last until April 2, when he said the administration plans to move ahead with reciprocal tariffs under which the U.S. will impose levies that match those imposed by trading partners.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the current hiatus is about getting fentanyl deaths down, which is the initial justification Trump used for the tariffs on Mexico and Canada and levies on Chinese goods that have now risen to 20%.\n\n\"On April 2, we're going to move with the reciprocal tariffs, and hopefully Mexico and Canada will have done a good enough job on fentanyl that this part of the conversation will be off the table, and we'll move just to the reciprocal tariff conversation,\" Lutnick said. \"But if they haven't, this will stay on.\"\n\nIndeed, Trudeau is expecting the U.S. and Canada to remain in a trade war.\n\n\"I can confirm that we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future,\" he told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nEl Paso Times reporter Jeff Abbott contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/26/trump-automobile-tariffs/82674047007/", "title": "Trump announces 25% auto tariffs amid shaky markets, global trade ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, barreling forward with a whiplash economic strategy that has rattled markets and ignited a global trade war.\n\nTrump detailed the tariffs, which will start at 2.5% and rise to 25% on all foreign cars and light trucks, in front of reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n“This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,” Trump said before signing an executive order directing the tariffs, which will go in effect April 2. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking jobs, taking our wealth, taking so much out of our country.\"\n\nThe tariffs will also apply to some imported auto parts, including engines and transmissions, according to the White House.\n\nAutomobiles that fall under the umbrella of imports protected in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement — a trade deal orchestrated by Trump in his first term — won’t be subject to the full tariff rate. Instead, the U.S will only levy tariffs on the foreign parts that make up vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe new auto tariffs ‒ which Trump characterized as \"very modest\" ‒ will go on top of existing tariffs on the imports.\n\nThe move comes ahead of his long-promised reciprocal tariffs, which are also set to go into effect April 2, whereby the United States will respond to any nation's tariffs on U.S. exports with tariffs of the same rate on imports from that country.\n\nU.S. stocks tumbled in after-hours trading after the auto announcement. Futures contracts tied to the broad S&P 500 index were down more than 1%, while those linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were off nearly 2% in the late afternoon.\n\nAutomaker stocks were also lower: General Motors Company shares lost nearly 5% and shares of Ford Motor Company, the only major U.S. carmaker to end the trading day higher, were more than 2% lower.\n\nThe United States imported $474 billion worth of automotive products in 2024, including passenger cars worth $220 billion. Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany, all close U.S. allies, were the biggest suppliers.\n\nStocks have been on a roller coaster ride as Trump has announced, then walked back, various rounds of tariffs over the past several weeks. Consumer sentiment has also been battered, and inflation expectations have spiked, concerning some Federal Reserve members. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are typically passed down from companies to consumers, economists warn.\n\nTrump has argued leveling tariffs on a broad set of industries will boost the nation's declining manufacturing sectors.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports from any country that purchases oil or gasoline from Venezuela, targeting the South American nation for what he called \"purposefully and deceitfully\" sending criminals into the United States.\n\nPreviewing the auto tariffs, Trump said manufacturers of cars and other products “are pouring back into the country” because of previously announced tariffs. Hyundai announced Monday a $5.8 billion investment in a Louisiana steel mill, as part of $20 billion in investment planned over the next four years.\n\n\"This is going to lead to the construction of a lot of plants, in this case, automobile plants,\" Trump said \"And you're going to see numbers like you haven't seen, in terms of employment.\" He acknowledged, however, \"It takes a little while.\"\n\nWhite House staff secretary Will Scharf, as he presented the order for Trump to sign, said the auto tariffs will result in more than $100 billion of annual revenue for the U.S.\n\n\"It's going to make our country very rich, because we're the piggy bank that everybody steals,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump noted that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., attended the tariff executive order in the Oval Office. The president added that congressional Republicans are developing legislation to give a tax deduction for interest on car loans for cars made in America.\n\n“Mike, I hope you can get that because it’s going to be amazing,” Trump said.\n\nIndustry experts and former U.S. officials expect the administration to rely on an investigation Trump used during his first term as justification for the new levies.\n\nIn a Wednesday morning sales forecast call, Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said massive increases in tariffs would be “highly disruptive” to North American vehicle production, potentially leading to tighter supply, higher prices and a “much weaker economy.”\n\nWithout carve-outs for automobiles and parts, Smoke said the auto market could be facing the highest effective tariff rate since World War II. Costs to make a vehicle assembled in Canada or Mexico could go up $6,000 or more, he said, while higher costs for parts could increase production costs for U.S.-made vehicles by roughly $3,000.\n\nSmoke said new and used prices would likely increase. Tariffs could also mean fewer affordable options for drivers. With roughly half of the affordable vehicles sold in the U.S. dependent on Mexico or Canada, Smoke said rising costs could eliminate some of those nameplates.\n\n“Storm clouds are forming on the horizon,” Smoke said, adding that disruptions could start as soon as mid-April.\n\nContributing: Andrea Riquier and Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/03/04/trump-tariffs-auto-industry-impact/81399379007/", "title": "Experts: Auto industry can tolerate Trump tariffs for just a few weeks", "text": "AI-assisted summary President Trump's 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico are expected to have a significant impact on the auto industry.\n\nExperts predict that the tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices, job losses, and potential closures of auto parts suppliers.\n\nIndustry leaders are urging the Trump administration to reconsider the tariffs and seek alternative solutions to address trade concerns.\n\nExperts predict that while the immediate impact might be muted due to existing inventory, the effects will become profound within weeks, leading to price hikes for consumers.\n\nThe tariffs threaten Michigan's economy, potentially causing job losses, supplier closures, and a recession if they remain in effect for an extended period.\n\nWhile some argue that tariffs could bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., others warn of severe consequences for the auto industry and consumers alike.\n\nThe auto industry can withstand only a few weeks of President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico until costs to automakers and suppliers rise astronomically, resulting in higher consumer prices and risking massive job losses, experts said Tuesday.\n\nThe industry reacted to Trump's move at midnight to put 25% tariffs — the taxes paid on products when they cross international borders — on goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump also increased tariffs on goods from China by another 10% on top of the 10% he enacted last month. Trump said the moves will push manufacturers to build more things in the United States.\n\nThe industry cannot quickly end foreign production and stand up domestic factories, with billions invested in long-term product cycles. In addition, U.S. automakers get a number of components for domestic assembly from Canada, Mexico and China. On top of that, the Detroit Three each build vehicles in Canada and Mexico that they sell in the United States. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors build vehicles in China that they sell in the states.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe tariffs mean the industry has weeks to figure out how to mitigate any production disruptions and absorb any increased costs before things really go off the rails, experts said.\n\n\"The tariffs will have a hugely negative impact on the auto industry and the economy as a whole,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights. \"In the immediate future, the impact will be somewhat muted because of the inventory that's already in the pipeline that hasn't been subjected to the tariffs. But once we get past a few weeks, the effects will start to get quite profound even for vehicles that are assembled in the U.S.\"\n\nProfits won't cover added costs\n\nThat's because the auto industry doesn't have the profit margins to fully absorb the extra 25% in costs, most of which will have to be passed on to consumers, Abuelsamid said.\n\n\"There are as many as 30,000 individual parts that go into a modern vehicle, with many of those ultimately crossing borders multiple times before a finished vehicle rolls off the assembly line,\" Abuelsamid said. \"From raw materials to increasingly complex subassemblies and then the final vehicle, each time something crosses the border, a tariff is assessed and paid by the importer, not the country that is exporting the product.\"\n\nHe added: \"For example, Ford will pay tariffs on gas V8 engines it brings in from Windsor and diesel V8s from Mexico that it puts into F-Series trucks. While those trucks are built in Dearborn, Kansas City and Louisville, those engines represent a significant portion of the value of the vehicle and there will be price increases to offset the tariffs on those engines and other components.\"\n\nWall Street realized this potential impact on the automakers and reacted Tuesday by selling stock in the Detroit Three. GM's stock price by early afternoon had plummeted by 3.1%, Ford was down 2% and Stellantis — the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands — saw its stock price tumble 4.5%.\n\nJob losses, supplier closures, recession outlook\n\nThe consensus among most experts is that costs will rise immediately, but manufacturers will absorb the added costs for a month or two.\n\n\"After that, consumers will likely see a 5% to 10% rise in prices,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions. \"If cooler heads prevail, this first round will be over before April.\"\n\nJeff Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said estimates that the tariffs would increase vehicle prices by up to $12,000 will have an impact.\n\n“That’s got to reduce demand for those vehicles from U.S. consumers because that’s too big a bite to bear in the pocketbook,” he said. “The big question is the duration of the tariffs and whether the tariffs will be extended to other countries.”\n\nEdmunds.com data showed that the average transaction price for a new vehicle in January 2025 was $48,118 and for a used car was $24,402.\n\nBeyond an affordability crisis is the fact that the auto industry is a pivotal part of the economy. It pumps $1.2 trillion a year into U.S. economy, making up about 5% of the gross domestic product. It also accounts for 10.1 million American jobs, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.\n\nAbuelsamid's firm projects that many auto parts suppliers, especially smaller companies, cannot afford to absorb the tariffs, relocate their facilities or to split their efforts across two or three countries. Therefore, many may end up going bankrupt in the coming months and years, he said.\n\nPut bluntly, Abuelsamid said, \"My projection is that we will see about a 1.5 million to 2 million unit annual reduction in sales in the U.S. for each year the tariffs are in effect. This will in turn lead to the likely loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs across the automotive ecosystem and into the wider economy that depends on people in the industry spending their wages. If the tariffs persist for any length of time, I expect it to lead to a recession within a year and an increase in unemployment.\"\n\nA 'mini disaster for the automotive industry'\n\nAutomakers, battery makers and suppliers are investing billions in U.S. manufacturing and to modernize the industrial base, said John Bozzella, CEO of Alliance for Automotive Innovation in a statement.\n\n\"But it’s worth remembering the sheer scale of the industry and the size of these automotive and advanced manufacturing facilities,\" Bozzella said. \"They’re massive. You just can’t relocate automotive production and the supply chain overnight.\"\n\nHe noted that auto tariffs in North America could end up increasing costs on consumers before jobs come back to the country.\n\nWall Street analysts are counting on the tariffs being in place for weeks rather than months.\n\n\"If these tariffs stay in place for longer than six months, we estimate on average a $4,000 to $5,000 increase in car prices,\" said Dan Ives, global head of technology research and managing director at Wedbush Securities. \"Ford has limited flexibility to move its manufacturing footprint and GM gets hit, but not as bad as Ford. It's a mini disaster in the making for the auto industry if it continues.\"\n\nErik Gordon, University of Michigan Ross School of Business professor, believes the tariffs will be short unless \"either country makes a false move.\" Gordon said, noting that Trump doesn't want to follow the usual international negotiation path that takes years to get an agreement to change.\n\n\"Traditionally, most of the time is spent on foot dragging by the country that doesn't want a change and on visits with lavish dinners, announcements of significant progress, but no actual progress,\" Gordon said. \"The president wants fast, real progress. If he sees it, he will let up on the pressure, but if Mexico or Canada try the usual foot dragging or engage in anti-U.S. rhetoric or retaliation, he will be more likely to increase the pressure than decrease it.\"\n\nMichigan's economic viability at stake\n\nBeyond these tariffs, Trump has said he intends to impose tariffs \"in the neighborhood of 25%\" on imported autos and similar tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports, according to Reuters. He has said the levies on vehicles would come as soon as April 2.\n\nThe Detroit Three directed the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, to a comment by the American Automotive Policy Council on their behalf. In the statement, council President Matt Blunt cited the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during Trump's first term: “We continue to believe that vehicles and parts that meet the USMCA’s stringent domestic and regional content requirements should be exempt from the tariff increase.\"\n\nThe purpose of the USMCA was to create what Trump considered a more balanced trade arrangement than the North American Free Trade Agreement reached in the 1990s.\n\n\"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” Blunt said.\n\nMichAuto, the state’s only automotive and mobility association, said the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico threaten Michigan's business climate and represent a \"bad-faith\" trade policy.\n\n\"Unilaterally imposing tariffs before United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement renegotiations even begin will undermine diplomatic processes and risk damaging Michigan’s relationships with its closest trading partners,\" said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives for the Detroit Regional Chamber.\n\nIn a statement to the Free Press, Stevens said, \"As MichAuto has continued to advise, the tariffs’ harmful effects will extend beyond trade relationships and will cause businesses to purchase and produce fewer products, hire fewer employees and increase prices to the detriment of consumers. Michigan’s economic viability and business attractiveness will be reduced to collateral damage.\"\n\nStevens urged the Trump administration and policymakers to prioritize \"constructive engagement over punitive measures\" which will damage state and nationwide businesses and consumers, he said.\n\nSimilarly, the American International Automobile Dealers Association CEO Cody Lusk said Tuesday in a statement that dealers and their customers are already reeling from rising car and parts prices, high interest rates and insurance costs, and the new tariffs pose an additional challenge to affordability.\n\n\"Tariffs can play an important role in balancing trade relationships and ensuring national security, but increasing barriers to trade also puts added pressure on the wallets of American families,\" Lusk said. \"In this case, tariffs could directly contribute to thousands of extra dollars on sticker prices. AIADA’s 9,400 members, seeking to protect their customers and their 560,000 American employees, urge our leaders and our trading partners to come together to negotiate a swift and practical end to these tariffs.”\n\nAutos Drive America, a group that represents international automakers who are in the United States, also addressed the issue of affordability for car buyers.\n\nJennifer Safavian, CEO of Autos Drive America, said in a statement, \"We are disappointed the U.S., Mexico and Canada could not reach a solution to avoid tariffs, which will undermine North American supply chains and cause costs to rise for U.S. auto manufacturers, and ultimately, the consumer. We urge the three countries to find a swift resolution that maintains the strength of the North American auto manufacturing sector.”\n\nThe UAW is the outlier, believing that tariffs will benefit the industry, at least the autoworkers in the industry.\n\n\"Corporations have been driving a non-stop race to the bottom by killing good blue-collar jobs in America to go exploit some poor worker in another country by paying poverty wages,\" the union said in a statement. \"Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals. We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class.\"\n\nThe union is in active talks with the Trump administration, it said, to end the \"free trade disaster.\"\n\n\"There’s been a lot of talk of these tariffs 'disrupting' the economy,\" the union's statement read. \"But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don’t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\"\n\nFarley: 'It's a devastating impact'\n\nFord leadership has been at the forefront trying to educate the Trump administration on the damage that will be done to the auto industry if any long-term tariffs are enacted against Canada and Mexico. Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford has said he has had phone conversations with the president on the topic and felt confident that Trump understands the ramifications and wants a strong American manufacturing base.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley was blunt about it last month during a talk at an investor conference.\n\n\"Let's be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen,\" Farley said at the Wolfe Research Auto, Auto Tech and Semiconductor Conference held in New York on Feb. 11.\n\nDuring Ford's fourth-quarter earnings call with investors days before that, Farley told Wall Street the automaker could withstand tariffs if they are short-term.\n\n“In the weeks scenario we’re in good shape, if it’s a number of weeks,\" Farley said in early February. \"With changing our stock level of our components, both ourselves and to our suppliers, and changing our manufacturing patterns in both Mexico, especially, and the U.S, we can make sure nothing crosses the border for a couple of weeks. We have good stock situation with our dealers right now.\"\n\nFarley said more than 80% of Ford's vehicles are made in the United States, all of its transmissions are made here and more than half of the engines, too.\n\nThe problem is Ford has no excess capacity at its plants to shift production from plants outside the states to the United States, he said.\n\n\"Our teams in the U.S. are flat-out already,\" Farley said. \"So we would have to make some major strategy shifts in the U.S., build new plants, et cetera if this persists. Obviously, it’s a devastating impact.”\n\nA key point to the tariffs that Farley has repeatedly pointed out is the fact that South Korea-based automaker Hyundai-Kia is importing 600,000 vehicles a year into the United States with no incremental tariff and Japan-based Toyota also imports 500,000 vehicles into the country annually with no incremental tariffs.\n\n“If we’re going to have tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it’s going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,” Farley said. “We can’t just cherry pick one place or another. This is a bonanza for our import competitors.”\n\nCar companies face decisions\n\nFarley’s assessments are not \"overly dramatic,\" said David Whiston, autos analyst at Morningstar.\n\n\"Before NAFTA, there was APTA done in 1965 by LBJ, which had free trade for the U.S. and Canadian auto industries, so 60 years of free trade has been blown up instantly,\" Whiston said. \"Supply chains are interwound across all three nations, so the automakers can’t just quickly move all the production to satisfy U.S. demand to U.S. plants. It takes time and billions of dollars.\"\n\nWhiston said it's hard to say how long the industry will wait before it makes massive investments in new facilities, but he believes the industry is probably waiting and hoping for an agreement on fentanyl and immigration issues before it has to make that call.\n\nStill, there remains the imposed a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States with no exceptions or exemptions and the threat of 25% tariffs on all imported autos coming on April 2.\n\n\"On the April 2 ones, no one knows yet if there will be a USMCA carveout exemption or if Canadian/Mexican made vehicles would be exempt from the April 2 ones since the March 4 ones are now in effect,\" Whiston said.\n\nAccording to data from Edmunds.com, through February, 48.6% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. were built in the United States, 17.4% were built in Mexico, 7.4% in Canada and 26.5% in other countries.\n\nDavid Soberman, a professor of marketing at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, called the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration “very unfortunate” and said it be would hard on both the Canadian and U.S economies.\n\n“It is already causing a lot of instability in the stock market. I believe it will fuel inflation in the U.S. It is important to remember that it is Americans who have to pay Donald Trump’s tariffs if they continue to buy Canadian goods,” Soberman said.\n\nAsked about the impact on the auto industry in both countries, Soberman pointed “especially” to GM, Ford and Stellantis and their key parts and components suppliers.\n\n“Since 1965, when the two countries signed an Auto Pact, the industries in both countries are integrated, almost like there isn’t a border,” he said.\n\nU-M's Gordon noted that carmakers have had more than a month to stockpile inventory from Canada and Mexico, but probably can't go longer than 30 days without facing shortages that could interrupt production of certain models. For now, he said, buyers will still have lots of cars to choose from, but not every model.\n\n\"Car companies have to decide how to rearrange U.S. production capacity for an unknown length of time because they don't know how long the tariffs will last or how high they will end up being,\" Gordon said. \"That won't be easy. They already projected EV demand inaccurately and got whipsawed. They are not looking forward to getting whipsawed on tariffs.\"\n\nAlliance for Automotive Innovation's Bozzella holds out hope that Trump understands the importance of a healthy and globally competitive auto industry and will reverse course.\n\n\"He’s stressed his commitment to the industry and auto workers during the campaign and since the inauguration,\" Bozzella said. \"We look forward to working with the administration on solutions that achieve the president’s goals, keep the industry competitive and in a position to support the country’s economic and national security in the years ahead.”\n\nEric D.

Now, experts are warning consumers to prepare for more price increases spurred by a new tariff on auto imports.\n\nStarting April 2, President Donald Trump is set to impose a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles, light trucks and some auto parts. For imported cars protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, only the foreign parts that make up the vehicle will be subject to the tariff.\n\n“We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth,” Trump said inside the Oval Office. He said the tariffs will \"spur growth like you haven’t seen before.”\n\nThe move follows a temporary tariff exemption granted earlier this month at the behest of three large U.S. automakers. After the monthlong reprieve, auto experts say higher prices are likely on the horizon.\n\n\"You're going to see price increases,\" said Ivan Drury, director of insights at automotive research site Edmunds. \"It's such a shotgun approach. Virtually nothing goes unscathed.\"\n\nWhat auto tariffs mean for consumers\n\nIn a sales forecast call Wednesday, Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke said massive increases in tariffs would be “highly disruptive” to North American vehicle production and could lead to tighter supply and higher prices.\n\n“By mid-April, we expect disruptions,” Smoke said. “We expect sales to fall, new and used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated if those tariffs persist.”\n\nDrury said price increases will probably vary. Some companies may pass price hikes from the 25% tariff directly to consumers, while others may bear some of the costs to remain competitive and ease cost pressures in other ways, such as reducing incentives.\n\nBut with the tariff expected to hit both imported vehicles and key auto parts like engines and transmissions, Drury said consumers can expect price increases \"across the board.\" That includes new cars, used cars, maintenance costs and even insurance premiums, because accidents involving new parts would be more costly.\n\nCars assembled in the U.S. wouldn't be safe from tariffs either, Drury said, because they import parts from other countries.\n\n\"There is no vehicle that is 100% American in that regard,\" Drury said. Used vehicles will see \"a bit more lag time, but there will be an effect.\"\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said questions remain on exactly how these tariffs will be applied or whether they will be altered in the coming weeks. In their current form, he estimates they could push up the average car price $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the make and model.\n\nThe tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers,\" Ives said in a note Wednesday. But \"we continue to believe this is some form of negotiation and these tariffs could change.\"\n\nIf tariffs do hold, they could encourage increased investment in U.S. manufacturing and a more resilient auto industry, according to a note from Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. But those potential long-term benefits will take time.\n\n\"For consumers navigating higher prices in the short term, the promise of future gains may feel distant − at least for now,\" Caldwell said.\n\nHow much does a new car cost today?\n\nThe tariffs come shortly after pandemic-era supply chain disruptions pushed up car prices for U.S. drivers. New vehicle prices are up about 25% since early 2020, according to Kelley Blue Book, with the average transaction price for a new vehicle just above $48,000 as of February.\n\nMeanwhile, higher interest rates have pushed up auto loans, which makes affording a new vehicle “a real challenge for most households,” Erin Keating, executive analyst for Cox Automotive, said in a statement this month.\n\nAnother report from AAA found the cost the total cost to own and operate a new vehicle was roughly $1,025 a month in 2024, including expenses like maintenance, fuel, insurance, financing and depreciation. That's up more than $200 a month from 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/01/voters-to-face-two-referendum-questions-about-election-administration/73119772007/", "title": "Voters to face two referendum questions about election administration", "text": "MADISON — Wisconsin voters will see two referendum questions related to election administration on their April 2 ballots — and in the days leading up to the election, they may also see messaging seeking to steer their vote.\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups are encouraging voters to support the measures with a \"yes\" vote, while Democrats and liberal groups are advocating for \"no.\" The two questions, which all Wisconsin voters will see on their ballots, are written as follows:\n\nQUESTION 1: \"Use of private funds in election administration. Shall section 7 (1) of article III of the constitution be created to provide that private donations and grants may not be applied for, accepted, expended, or used in connection with the conduct of any primary, election, or referendum?\"\n\nQUESTION 2: \"Election officials. Shall section 7 (2) of article III of the constitution be created to provide that only election officials designated by law may perform tasks in the conduct of primaries, elections, and referendums?\"\n\nVoting \"yes\" on the first question means private grants and donations would be banned in election administration going forward, while a \"no\" vote would continue to allow them. A \"yes\" vote on the second question would add to the state Constitution that only election officials can perform tasks, while a \"no\" vote would not add that.\n\nThe proposals are rooted in Republicans' longstanding scrutiny of millions of dollars in private grants, which they often call \"Zuckerbucks.\" The bulk of the money provided by the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which at the time received funding from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, went to the state's five largest cities to help them run elections during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nClerks who received grants during the 2020 election said it helped them meet the unexpected costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as extra supplies to meet an influx of absentee voting, and have said accepting grants due to inadequate state, federal or local funding would not jeopardize their ability to administer elections fairly.\n\nHere's a look at the messaging surrounding the referendum.\n\nConservatives encourage 'yes' votes\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups have supported voting \"yes\" on the questions based on concerns that outside groups could influence how elections are run. In one case, the Republican Party of Wisconsin brought in an Ohio congressman to make that point.\n\n\"Secure elections require proper election administration. That's why I'm encouraging everyone in Wisconsin to vote 'yes' on constitutional amendments 1 and 2,\" U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan said in a video Wednesday. He appeared alongside U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican former President Donald Trump's campaign is also backing the proposals with social media posts urging Wisconsin voters to \"ban Zuckerbucks.\"\n\nOne conservative group is taking a slightly different tack. MacIver Impact, Inc. — the newly-created 501(c)4 arm of the John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy — launched a digital advertising campaign in support of the ballot measures earlier this month. Although MacIver itself is a conservative organization, several ads prompt voters to \"stop the NRA from buying elections\" and \"stop right-wing billionaires like Elon Musk from buying elections.\" Others, however, urge Wisconsinites to \"keep Obama & Soros out of Wisconsin elections\" and \"ban Zuckerbucks.\" The ads are running on Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"What happened during the 2020 election should never be allowed to happen again in Wisconsin. That means permanently ending organizations with outside interests from having a role in the administration of our elections,” said MacIver Impact CEO Annette Olson in a statement. “These common sense amendments would ban dark money from playing a role in administering elections, and MacIver Impact is proud to lead statewide efforts to encourage citizens to vote ‘yes.'\"\n\nLiberals advocate against proposals\n\nDemocrats and liberal groups have pushed for a \"no\" vote, arguing the proposed amendments are confusing and could impede the administration of elections barring the allocation of additional state funding.\n\nAn analysis from the Legislature's nonpartisan attorneys said the impact of adding the language to the state Constitution is unclear. State law already says that only appointed election officials can conduct elections, but doesn't say what activities count as conducting an election. The referendum doesn't specify that, either.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin weighed in on the amendments on March 19, endorsing a \"no\" vote on both questions. In a statement, party chairman Ben Wikler said Republicans were pushing the amendment to \"satisfy Donald Trump.\"\n\nOther liberal-leaning groups have also encouraged voters to reject the questions. The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin said the language is too vague and could prevent clerks from using non-public locations or equipment for polls, such as a church or chairs and tables owned by the church. The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin also opposes the measures, arguing local clerks don't receive sufficient funding from the state and federal governments.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democracy Campaign has also supported voting \"no\" and told voters not to get \"duped.\" The group noted Republicans are putting forward the constitutional amendments — which do not need Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' approval — during a primary election with typically lower turnout.\n\nWisconsin voters generally vote in favor of referendum questions\n\nWhile political and advocacy groups are messaging on the initiatives, Rob Yablon, University of Wisconsin Law School professor and co-director of the State Democracy Research Initiative, said there doesn't appear to be a significant organized effort on either side of the issue.\n\n\"I am not aware of any huge expenditures of funds on either side,\" Yablon said. \"That's not atypical, compared to other recent proposed amendments in Wisconsin — if you look back at the ones that we've had in recent years, most of them have been a little bit below the radar.\"\n\nWisconsin voters typically approve referendums. Out of the 200 times lawmakers have proposed changes to the state Constitution since 1854, voters have only rejected the changes about 50 times, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau.\n\nSince 2000, nine of 10 proposed constitutional amendments have succeeded — the exception being an effort to eliminate the state treasurer's office.\n\nThe most recent constitutional amendments approved by Wisconsin voters include two questions last year that expanded the criteria for setting cash bail. Another amendment approved in 2020, often called Marsy's Law, brought a flood of television, radio and social media ads.\n\nThat high success rate is likely attributable in part to the fact that the Legislature has broad authority to select the wording of ballot initiatives, as well as when they appear on the ballot, Yablon said.\n\nThe questions on the April 2 ballot are two of five scheduled to go before voters this year. That's the most Wisconsin voters have seen in one year since 1982, Yablon said.\n\n\"It seems to be a function in part of divided government,\" he said, noting that Evers had previously vetoed legislative efforts to accomplish the same results.\n\n\"There does seem to be a little bit of a trend on the part of the Legislature to seek change through constitutional amendments, maybe in part because they can't get it through legislation right now.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/26/wisconsins-uninstructed-push-what-it-means-in-april-2024-presidential-primary-election-biden/72975629007/", "title": "Wisconsin's 'uninstructed' push: What it means in April 2024 election", "text": "Note: This story has been corrected to reflect that Leaders Igniting Transformation is not an official endorser of Listen to Wisconsin.\n\nIn summer 2020, Ismail El-Hassan spent every day in the sweltering sun, door-knocking for Joe Biden.\n\nBut, April 2, he plans to vote against the incumbent president as an uninstructed voter, alongside other Wisconsinites protesting the Biden administration's military aid for Israel.\n\nEl-Hassan, a 24-year-old University of Wisconsin-Madison law student, first heard about uninstructed voting on a trip to Michigan. Among a group of law students and professors, conversation swirled around the subject of Michigan's uncommitted movement, led by a cohort of Arab Americans and Muslim activists.\n\nEl-Hassan, who's Muslim, hoped to find a similar initiative in Wisconsin. Then, Listen to Wisconsin, a group encouraging Wisconsin voters to cast uninstructed votes, emerged. On Monday, 20 state and local elected officials endorsed the campaign.\n\nUsing the skills he gained as a canvasser for Biden, El-Hassan estimates he's spoken to over 30 people — friends, classmates, Uber drivers and more — about his decision to vote uninstructed. During these conversations, he encouraged others to do the same.\n\n\"What do we get out of Biden's thinking that he wins no matter what? Like, what do we get out of him?\" El-Hassan said. \"Pointing a bogeyman and then just being, like, 'Vote for me.'\"\n\nThough El-Hassan is open to supporting Biden in November, he said the movement aims to address a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where an estimated 1.1 million civilians are at risk of famine and face limited access to medical treatment and other essential resources, according to a recent report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\n\n\"We need to send a statement now, and then hopefully that can save people's lives,\" he said. \"And then, after the primaries, we can talk about who we're gonna vote for November.\"\n\nSince launching in March, Listen to Wisconsin's coalition of organizers and community leaders use text-banking events, social media posts and canvassing to try to mobilize voters.\n\nA text message from the organization reads, \"No matter how you plan on voting in November, this primary is our best chance to tell President Biden — enough is enough! We don't want our tax dollars funding this inhumane massacre anymore.\"\n\nThousands of votes have chosen similar options like \"uncommitted\" or \"no preference\" in other states that have already held their primaries. That's leading to questions about whether the \"uninstructed\" movement could make Biden vulnerable in Wisconsin, a key November battleground state. In 2020, he won Wisconsin by a little over 20,000 votes.\n\n\"In Wisconsin, the stakes are uniquely high,\" said Anthony Chergosky, a University of Wisconsin La-Crosse political science professor. \"So even if the uninstructed vote gets a fairly small percentage, that still matters in a state where a swing of a few thousand votes here or there could change the outcome.\"\n\nWhy are some groups encouraging the uninstructed option?\n\nWhen presented with the opportunity to join Listen to Wisconsin, Voces de la Frontera Action's executive committee met to discuss how issues facing the immigrant and Latino community and pro-Palestinian groups intersect.\n\nSome organizers said they got backlash from peers and family members for pushing people to vote uninstructed, but they believe the frustration is from fear and limited knowledge.\n\n\"The only concern that we have is to obviously not create confusion, and to really make sure that we're doing education on how immigration connects to the plight of the Palestinians,\" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera Action. \"We're not sending a message to vote Trump.\"\n\nYouth-focused civic engagement organization Leaders Igniting Transformation told the Journal Sentinel that the movement struck a chord with young voters seeking a pathway to how elected officials accountable and demonstrate the political priority that young people place on a Gaza ceasefire.\n\n\"Young people vote for candidates who align with their values and are committed to addressing the issues that matter most to them,\" said Amanda Avalos, Leaders Igniting Transformation co-director. \"They’re paying attention. They see when politicians they overwhelmingly helped to elect ignore them, and they are using their vote to push back.\"\n\nAccording to Listen to Wisconsin organizers, the group's organizing base is a collective of young voters, people of color, left-wing progressives and moderates. Their shared interest is peace.\n\n\"We don't want lip service and we're done with games,\" organizer Janan Najeeb said. \"We want unhindered and complete access to all humanitarian aid, including clean water, food, medical supplies, and equipment for Palestinians. We want the release of all hostages.\"\n\nState Rep. Ryan Clancy, who's also a Milwaukee County supervisor, said he usually votes early but is waiting until April 2 to see if Biden changes course. Clancy has talked to younger and progressive voters who just want to sit the election out, which he thinks \"would be a real shame.\"\n\n\"I cannot bring myself to vote for somebody who is enabling genocide,\" Clancy said. \"I want to be very clear, I do not want another four years of Donald Trump. I believe that this campaign is the best way to prevent that. Because the goal here is not to vote against Biden. It's to effect policy change.\"\n\nDo some voters plan to vote for third parties instead?\n\nThird-party candidates like the Green Party's Jill Stein have presented themselves as Biden alternatives, though they aren't on Wisconsin's primary ballot.\n\nAmaya Bauldwin, an 18-year-old Milwaukee native attending North Carolina Central University, is voting for the first time. She doesn't want her vote to go to waste.\n\nBauldwin said the issues driving her are more local, like the funding of Milwaukee Public Schools, but she sees how voting uninstructed or third-party could help people who feel their voices aren't being heard.\n\n\"I haven't decided yet, because I know third parties don't usually have electoral power,\" she said, \"but I think it would definitely make a statement once they say, 'OK, these people aren't coming out to vote.'\"\n\nChergosky noted there are different ways of casting \"protest votes\" in presidential elections.\n\n\"Democrats who are unhappy with Biden could plug their nose and vote for him,\" he said. \"They could also vote uninstructed in the primary and then threaten to sit out the election. They could also vote third-party.\n\n\"I think those latter two options are particularly concerning for Democrats in closely divided states like Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe \"uninstructed delegation\" option also picked up a few thousand votes in both parties in Wisconsin's 2020 presidential primary. About 3,590 chose that option on the Democratic side, and 11,246 on the Republican side, where Trump was the only remaining candidate.\n\nIn interviews with the Journal Sentinel, most Listen to Wisconsin organizers ruled out voting third-party. They'd more likely not vote or consider voting for Biden than cast a ballot that makes little to no impact.\n\nHow has the Biden campaign responded to the uninstructed movement?\n\nSome protests have been staged during recent Biden administration visits to Wisconsin, including the president's trip to Milwaukee earlier in March. About 125 people gathered in Red Arrow Park and said they wouldn't vote for Biden in the primary as a demonstration of their outrage over the United States' response to the war.\n\nIn response, the Biden campaign issued a statement similar to those it gave in response to other state primary protest votes.\n\n\"The President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans. He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. He's working tirelessly to that end,\" campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said.\n\nAt a March 3 event in Selma, Ala., Vice President Kamala Harris called for an immediate, temporary ceasefire in Gaza, urging Israeli officials to negotiate with Hamas for an exchange of hostages. NBC reported that National Security Council officials \"watered down\" Harris' speech to reduce aggressive criticism of Israel.\n\nThe Biden administration is building a temporary pier to deliver humanitarian aid for citizens and has asked Israel to not launch a military campaign in Rafah to avoid further civilian endangerment. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the appeal.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump hasn't called for any restraint of military force in the region.\n\nWhat does 'uninstructed delegation' actually mean?\n\nVoters in a presidential primary are actually votes to send delegates in support of a candidate to the parties' nominating conventions. That includes the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer.\n\nChoosing an \"uninstructed delegation\" means the delegate would go to the convention without being \"instructed\" to vote for any specific candidate. Wisconsin's primary is already \"advisory\" rather than \"binding\" — meaning delegates aren't required to vote for a certain candidate at the convention.\n\nOn the Democratic side, candidates must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to earn delegates. Uncommitted delegates have earned 20 spots in other primary states. Clancy said he would be the \"first to volunteer\" if Wisconsin has uninstructed delegates and \"make that case for policy change\" at the convention.\n\nHow many people voted uninstructed in other state primaries?\n\nStates have slightly different wordings for the vote option, such as \"uncommitted\" or \"no preference.\" Some states like Arizona don't have that option on the ballot, and organizers instead urged Democrats to vote for Marianne Williamson, who has advocated for a ceasefire for months.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, when 15 states held their primaries, the \"uncommitted\" option didn't win any races but beat out other candidates in the Democratic primary. In Michigan, a battleground state like Wisconsin, around 13% of voters chose the option, representing more than 100,000 votes.\n\nIn Minnesota — which has a similar population to Wisconsin — 45,915 people selected the \"uncommitted\" option, or 19%. In North Carolina, 88,021 voters selected \"no preference,\" or around 13%. Other states had much smaller percentages compared to what Biden won, but still represented thousands of voters.\n\nWhat would a large uninstructed vote mean for the Biden campaign in Wisconsin?\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes. If the uninstructed vote count April 2 is around that size or larger, it could show Biden's vulnerability in the state. The Republican Party of Wisconsin didn't respond to a request for comment about what it could mean for its margins.\n\nAfter the primary, Chergosky said he's going to be watching how campaigns interpret and respond to those numbers.\n\nIf the uninstructed vote is small in Wisconsin and the Biden campaign knows the base is with it, then it can \"go all-in on reaching out to swing voters in the suburbs,\" he said. But if it's more significant, \"the Biden campaign might think to themselves that they really need to shore up the base in advance of the November election.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

Canadian officials said they would respond with a 25% tariff, while China is retaliating with tariffs on American agricultural products and Mexico is considering retaliation.\n\nChina's tariffs, which take effect next week, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, and a 10% tariff on soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, and dairy and fish products.\n\n\"To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,\" Trump said in a Monday post on Truth Social. \"Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\"\n\nHow Trump trade war could hurt Kansas farmers\n\nNewland spoke to reporters in a Tuesday press call with U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., who serves on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee. Newland is Davids' guest at Trump's Tuesday night address to Congress.\n\n\"President Trump's trade policies certainly have the potential to impact and hurt Kansas,\" Davids said. \"I would go so far as to say that there's potential for this to be a reckless approach.\n\n\"I think that too many people have already seen the consequences of trade instability before. There were certain tariffs that were imposed during the first term of the president where American farmers lost almost $27 billion in exports. That was between 2018 and 2019, and to keep our agriculture economy strong, we do need trade policies that are going to open doors for our farmers and certainly reduce or eliminate the chances that we create any new obstacles.\"\n\nNewland was a Republican state lawmaker from Neodesha before being elected to the top job at the Kansas Farm Bureau in December 2022.\n\n\"The president sees where the tariffs can be a bargaining tool, so we'll look at it that way,\" Newland said. \"But the initial effect could be higher prices for inputs, like from Canada on our fertilizer.\"\n\n\"The American Farm Bureau asked the president to delay the new tariffs because of their concerns for our farmers,\" Davids said. \"Thus far, the president refused those requests, and now we we're looking at a situation where Kansas farmers are at risk of facing higher costs for things like fertilizer and fewer buyers for their products.\"\n\nAfter Trump's first trade war hurt farmers, his administration had a series of farm bailout programs totaling $28 billion. Davids said she doesn't know whether his administration will consider that again going forward, saying the president's approach lacks predictability and certainty.\n\nWhile the president is telling farmers to \"have fun,\" Newland said the tariffs will cause uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is definitely the optimum word here,\" Newland said. \"Because it's not only the uncertainty of not having a farm bill, it's uncertainty of what these trade tariffs and all would have long term effect, or if they're a short-term effect, and whether we can improve our trade negotiations with these other countries because of them.\n\n\"So I think that's the unpredictable part, it's the unforeseen part. But we want to make sure that we can keep agriculture strong, and so we need to make sure that these tariffs are used to make these trading partners more viable for us.\"\n\nFarm Bureau hopes for improved trade opportunities\n\nWhile Trump is telling farmers to look at selling their produce inside the U.S., Newland said international \"trade is also extremely important for Kansas agriculture\" as \"we rely on both domestic and international.\"\n\n\"It's very important for American agriculture — for Kansas agriculture — to have strong trade,\" Newland said.\n\nNewland emphasized trade missions to market grain to other countries. He said the U.S. needs \"to make sure that we get these new trade deals done soon to make sure that we don't have a long-term effect.\"\n\nDavids said trade missions help with \"getting Kansas farmers familiar with other markets and trying to increase the number of countries that Kansas farmers are exporting to.\" That means more customers to buy American crops, she said.\n\nNewland said the American Farm Bureau's trade committee, which he sits on, would meet Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Anytime that you lose any market anywhere, it's impactful for the producer here in the state of Kansas,\" Newland said. \"That's the reason it's even more important that we reach out and form more trade policies, more trade deals, with other countries, so that we can fall back.\"\n\nHe said China's retaliatory tariffs show why the U.S. needs more trade partners elsewhere.\n\n\"What's most important is the lack of new trade deals that we lacked over the last several years,\" he said. \"We can't just rely on the same two or three trading partners all the time. We need to expand trade to other countries. This just brings to light just how important that part is.\"\n\nTrump tariffs targets top ag export markets\n\nTrump's trade war targets the top export destinations for American agriculture, including Kansas farmers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reported last week that 2024 agricultural exports totaled $176 billion. The top three export markets were Mexico at $30.3 billion, Canada at $28.4 billion and China at $24.7 billion.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Agriculture's latest international trade statistics have the state's agricultural exports at $4.64 billion in 2023. That was 33% of the state's total exports of $14 billion. Mexico was the top agricultural export market for Kansas at $1.73 billion, Canada was second at $528 million and China was fourth at $423 million.\n\n\"We have a strong export relationship with China,\" Davids said. \"What I personally am concerned about is actually the retaliatory tariffs. I mean, I'm concerned about the unpredictability and the uncertainty that any of our farmers, ranchers, producers, of course, and just our general economy. Because tariffs are going to make things more expensive, whether we're talking about vehicles and equipment, or when it comes to our exports.\n\n\"This is one of the reasons I am going to be very keyed in on everything the president says tonight about his vision for how he thinks these tariffs are going to help in negotiating so that America can continue to be a leader in so many areas, but also so that Kansas can continue to export our goods around the world.\"\n\nJason Alatidd is a Statehouse reporter for The Topeka Capital-Journal.

The conversations culminated with Hegseth, hours before the airstrikes, sharing secret plans ‒ including targets and attack sequencing ‒ in the chat.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have said the Signal leak - by federal officials using the publicly available encrypted messaging app - raises alarming questions about the potential mishandling of national security information, which federal law dictates should only be shared through the government's own approved secure platforms.\n\nThe White House's National Security Council is investigating the incident, Gabbard told senators on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also confirmed to reporters that he expected the committee that oversees the Pentagon would look into the Trump administration's use of Signal.\n\nTop House Democrat calls for Trump to fire Hegseth\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sent a letter to President Donald Trump Tuesday urging him to “immediately” fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.“The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans—including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used—during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,” Jeffries wrote in the letter. “His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.”- Riley Beggin\n\nJust something that can happen’: Trump downplays Signal chat fiasco\n\nTrump insisted Tuesday afternoon no classified information was shared in the Signal chat and defended his national security adviser, who mistakenly invited The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief into a chat group with top Trump officials.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the White House' Cabinet room, Trump downplayed the gravity of the security breach during meeting with several of his ambassador picks and said Waltz has no reason to apologize.\n\n“It’s just something that can happen. You can even prepare for it, and it can happen.” Trump said. “We always want to use the best technology. This was the best technology for the moment.”\n\nTrump said the White House will consider potential changes to security practices and how officials communicate with each other including the use of Signal, which he said he will likely not be used as often.\n\n\"We'll look into it,\" Trump said. \"But everybody else seems to be using it, it seems to be the number one used device or app, whatever you want to call it.\"\n\n\"It's used by a lot of the military, and I think, successfully,” he said. “But sometimes somebody can get onto those things. That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"\n\nEven though the White House has acknowledged the contents in The Atlantic’s story, Trump lashed out at the reporter, calling him a “sleazebag” who works for a “failed magazine.”\n\nWaltz says he’s investigating ‘how the heck’ reporter got into chat\n\nWaltz also lashed out on Tuesday at Goldberg, telling reporters he’s never met The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief and will investigate how he mistakenly invited him into a Signal chat group with other Trump officials.\n\nTrump asked Waltz to address reporters about the Signal chat during a meeting in the White House Cabinet Room.\n\n“Mr. President, you asked about lessons,” Waltz said. “There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.”\n\n“And this one in particular,” Waltz said of Goldberg, “I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are looking into him and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”\n\nWaltz told Trump the reporter “wants the world talk about more hoaxes and this kind of nonsense rather than the freedom that you're enabling.”\n\nTrump said the main thing is the attack on Houthi sites in Yemen was a success. “The Houthis are absolutely on the run. The worst of them have been killed,” Trump said.\n\nTrump stands by his national security adviser\n\nTrump, in a phone interview Tuesday morning with NBC News, stood by Walz in his first substantive remarks on the security breach. \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,\" the president said.\n\nTrump told NBC that Goldberg's presence in the chat had \"no impact at all\" on the military operation.\n\n“It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,\" Trump said when asked what he was told about how Goldberg was added to the Signal chat.\n\nTrump defended his national security team despite the details revealed in The Atlantic's story, calling the situation \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.\"\n\nFBI director briefed about Signal scandal\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said he was briefed about the Signal incident Monday night and again on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I don’t have an update,” Patel said in response to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner’s question of whether the FBI had launched an investigation into the potential leak of classified information.\n\nWarner had asked Gabbard, seated to Patel’s left in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, to confirm she was one of several senior officials a part of the group chat.\n\n“I’m not going to get into the specifics,” Gabbard said repeatedly, adding, “because this is currently under review by the National Security Council.”\n\nRatcliffe, the CIA director and another reported member of the Signal chat, confirmed to Warner he was a member of the virtual group.\n\nTrump officials deny classified information was shared\n\nBoth Gabbard and Ratcliff claimed there was nothing classified or at risk of endangering national security included in the messaging thread.\n\n“I’m a little staggered that that is your view,” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said at one point to Ratcliffe.\n\nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, also pushed Gabbard on the issue, asking, “So the attack sequencing and timing and weapons and targets you don’t consider should have been classified?”\n\nGabbard deferred the question to the Department of Defense.\n\nRepublican leaders promise investigation\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his panel plans to investigate the Signal group chat to \"see what the facts are.\"\n\n\"It's definitely a concern,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said in an interview with CNN. \"You can be sure the committee, House and Senate, will be looking into this. And it appears that mistakes were made. No question.\"\n\nThune, the Senate's top Republican, later told reporters in the U.S. Capitol that he expected Wicker's panel would investigate the matter.\n\nHegseth revealed details about planned airstrikes\n\nOn the morning of the Saturday attack in Yemen, Goldberg said Hegesth sent an update to the group that contained \"operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen,\", including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing.\n\nGoldberg said he did not publicize the full transcript of Hegseth's message because of the sensitive nature of the attack details.\n\n\"I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts,\" Goldberg wrote in his article. \"The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility.\n\nTrump officials used emojis to celebrate military operation’s execution\n\nAs the airstrikes were carried out in Yemen, several Trump officials responded with emojis, according to The Atlantic report.\n\n“I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote in the chat, with two other users subsequently adding prayer emojis.\n\nWaltz provided an update to the group, describing the operation as an “amazing job.” He later sent the group three emojis: a fist, an American flag and fire.\n\nRubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles congratulated Hegseth and the United States Central Command for executing the operation. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, responded with five emojis: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep and two American flags.\n\nMembers of the chat then discussed the damage that resulted from the airstrikes as well as the likely death count, according to Goldberg.\n\nVance discussed reservations about Houthi strikes\n\nThe airstrikes came in response to more than two years of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Rea Sea that has disrupted shipping.\n\nBut ahead of the airstrikes, Vance shared concerns about carrying out plans, telling the group he worried the operation could undercut Trump's foreign policy position on matters that impact Europe more than the U.S.\n\nAt one point he said, \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.”\n\nIn another message, Vance told the group: “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”\n\nWhy was a reporter included in the chat?\n\nIt is unclear why Goldberg, a longtime Washington-based reporter and editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the chat of Trump officials.\n\nGoldberg said he received a connection request from a Signal user with name Mike Waltz on March 13. Two days later, he was added to a chat called “Houthi PC small group.”\n\nNo one realized that Goldberg, whose username appeared as \"JG,\" had been added, Goldberg wrote.\n\nGoldberg said he was initially suspicious about the chat, wary that it could be a hoax designed to entrap a reporter and skeptical top national security officials would be using a phone app to discuss such sensitive material. He said he realized it was authentic when the Yemen airstrike plans revealed by Hegseth came to fruition.\n\n\"I didn’t think it could be real,\" The Atlantic article's headline said. \"Then the bombs started falling.\"\n\nTop Senate Intelligence Democrat blasts witnesses for Signal scandal\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Warner wasted no time bringing up The Atlantic’s scathing story in his opening remarks during the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing Tuesday morning on global threats to the United States.\n\nWarner, vice chairman of the committee, condemned the reported group chat of senior officials – which included Gabbard and Ratcliffe, who sat facing Warner and the committee as witnesses for the hearing.\n\n“Putting aside that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system,” Warner said, “it’s also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered to even check – security hygiene 101 – who are all the names? Who are they?”\n\nThe Virginia senator called the error reckless and sloppy, and said it was emblematic of issues across the Trump administration.\n\n“If this was the case of a military officer or an intelligence officer, and they had this kind of behavior, they would be fired,” Warner said. “I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information, that this is not a one-off or a first-time error.”\n\nTrump was charged with mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House when his first term concluded. A federal judge dismissed the indictment last summer and special counsel Jack Smith dropped his appeal to continue pursuing the federal criminal charges after Trump's presidential election victory last November.\n\nWhat is Signal?\n\nSignal, which is downloadable on Apple and other phone devices, is an open-source encrypted messaging often used by reporters who seek more privacy than traditional texting platforms.\n\nBut Signal is not approved by the government for classified communications. Its use by leading Trump national security officials leaves an opening for U.S. adversaries like China, Iran and Russia, national security experts say.\n\nSignal president calls app ‘gold standard’ in private communications\n\nMeredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, defended the app on social media as the “gold standard” in private communications even if top U.S. national security officials disclosed a pending attack on Houthis in Yemen to a journalist through an encrypted chat.\n\nWhittaker didn’t address the potential security breach of Waltz and others inviting Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief into a chat where the attack was discussed.\n\nBut she said Signal collects little data about its users, so there is little to see when the company receives subpoenas for information that it cannot resist.\n\n“Signal is the gold standard in private comms,” Whittaker said.\n\nWhite House acknowledges authenticity, downplays breach\n\nThe White House acknowledged the authenticity of the Signal chat but downplayed the significance of the breach, arguing the airstrike operation was executed as planned.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Goldberg of \"sensationalist spin,\" insisting that no \"war plans\" were discussed. She said no classified material was sent in the thread, adding that the White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a “number of different platforms” for Trump’s top officials to communicate.\n\nShe said the White House is “looking into” how Goldberg’s number was inadvertently added to the chat.\n\nHegseth also denied war plans were shared, telling reporters on Monday, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\nJournalist says group chat had military details\n\nRatcliffe and Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that their multi-day chat two weeks ago did not discuss the kind of specific operational details that could be considered classified related to the bombing of Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nBut in a series of interviews before Tuesday's hearing, Atlantic's Goldberg said the conversations by Ratcliffe, Gabbard, Hegseth and others in the days before the March 15 U.S. airstrike did contain those kinds of details.\n\nGoldberg told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Monday night that he wanted to be “responsible here and not disclose the things that I read and saw.”\n\nBut the journalist added, “I will describe them to you: The specific time of a future attack. Specific targets, including human targets meant to be killed in that attack. Weapons systems.”\n\n“Even weather reports that the government is ... I don't know why Hegseth was sharing it with everybody,” Goldberg said. “I mean, the precise detail. And then a long section on sequencing. This is gonna happen, then that is gonna happen. After that happens, this happens, then that happens, and then we go and find out if it worked.”\n\n“I mean, you know, he can say that it wasn't a war plan,” Goldberg said of Hegseth. “But it was a minute-by-minute accounting of what was about to happen.”\n\nTop Democrat on Intel Committee slams officials in Signal chat\n\nWarner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters the arguments that Gabbard and Ratcliffe made before his panel Tuesday were absurd “that somehow this might be defense intelligence but it’s not actual intelligence. Having senior military officials fighting over policy before you launch a military strike by its nature is classified information.”\n\n“You know the old adage, if you’re in a hole, stop digging,” Warner said. “Well, DNI Director Gabbard and CIA Director Ratcliffe today dug that hole a lot deeper in their dodging and weaving.”\n\nHe added that encrypted text messaging platforms like Signal are not intended to be used for classified information and expressed shock that the administration hasn’t said whether they’ve collected the phones or if they were personal phones the officials used for communicating.\n\n“I think you’re going to see a continued level of incompetence that’s going to stun even Trump’s supporters,” Warner said.\n\nJosh Meyer, Riley Beggin and Bart Jansen contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/26/hegseth-atlantic-war-plans-group-chat-updates/82669460007/", "title": "Trump admin on defensive as leak fallout spreads: Signal recap", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Atlantic magazine published Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's messages to a group chat detailing the times and weapons used to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, as the fallout deepened over Trump administration officials using the encrypted chat app Signal to discuss classified war plans.\n\nIn a new article published Wednesday morning, Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazine's editor-in-chief, posted pictures of messages Hegseth sent the chat – which included President Donald Trump's highest-level national security officials – listing the planned launch times of F-18s and Tomahawks. Goldberg discovered the chat in mid-March when Mike Waltz, Trump's top national security advisor, accidentally added him.\n\nNonetheless, Hegseth and White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt reiterated their claims Wednesday that \"war plans\" or classified information were discussed.\n\nThe White House acknowledged that Goldberg was accidentally added to the chat. In a Tuesday Fox News interview, Waltz took \"full responsibility\" for letting in Goldberg, promising to \"get to the bottom of it.\" During her briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Signal chat involving top national security officials and Goldberg contained no classified information.\n\nThe Trump administration's use of Signal, a messaging app publicly available on the app store, for sharing its war plans ignited mounting concerns over the national security breach.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the topic dominated a previously scheduled House Intelligence Committee hearing featuring testimony from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel. Democrats continued to call for Trump to fire Hegseth, while Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon told reporters the Trump administration is “in denial” on the issue.\n\nTrump questions whether Signal is defective\n\nTrump questioned the quality of Signal amid criticism over his national security team sharing plans for attacking Houthis with a reporter over the app.\n\n“I don’t know that Signal works,” Trump said. “It could be a defective platform and we’re going to have to find that out.”\n\nBut he said the results of the attacks on the Houthis have gone well.\n\n“The result is unbelievable,” Trump said. “The Houthis want peace because they’re getting the hell knocked out of them. It’s been very, very strong. The Houthis are dying for peace.”\n\nTrump said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz took responsibility for sharing the chat with Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\n“There was no harm done because the attack was unbelievably successful that night,” Trump said.\n\nAsked whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should resign, Trump said expressed confidence in him. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called on Trump to fire Hegseth Tuesday.\n\n“Hegseth is going a great job,” Trump said. “He had nothing to do with it.”\n\nHegseth shared details about the aircraft and flight times of the attack in the chat.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls allowing reporter on Signal chat ‘a big mistake’ and expects ‘reforms’\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that the information on the Signal chat shared with a reporter about a Houthis strike was a “mistake” and that he expected the White House to make “reforms” to prevent it from happening again.\n\n“I’ve been assured by the Pentagon and everyone involved that none of the information that was on there, though not intended to be divulged, obviously, that was a mistake and shouldn’t have happened and the White House is looking at it,” said Rubio, who was in Kingston, Jamaica. \"Obviously, it was a big mistake.\"\n\n“But none of the information that was on there at any point threatened the operation or the lives of our servicemen,” Rubio added. “In fact, it was a very successful operation, and it’s an ongoing operation.”\n\nThe Pentagon said the information wasn’t classified and there was no intelligence in the messages, Rubio said.\n\n“This was sort of a description of what we could inform our counterparts around the world when the time came to do so,” Rubio said.\n\nThe White House is investigating how the journalist became a part of the group.\n\n“I think there will be reforms and changes made so this is not going to happen again,” Rubio said. “It can’t.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHegseth says 'nobody's texting war plans'\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth continued to push back against characterizations that the information he texted other Trump administration officials in a Signal chat earlier this month was classified war plans.\n\n\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" he told reporters Wednesday afternoon before boarding a plane in Hawaii. \"As a matter of fact, they even changed the title to attack plans, because they know it's not war plans,\" he said. Earlier that morning, the Atlantic published an article that included screenshots of Hegseth's messages detailing weapons that would be used to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, and what times the strikes were planned.\n\n\"There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information,\" he added.\n\nResults of Houthis operation speak for themselves: White House\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted again on Wednesday that the Signal chat involving top national security officials and a reporter contained no classified information.\n\n“There was no classified information transmitted,” Leavitt told reporters. “There were no war plans discussed.”\n\nThe information included launch times for F-18 flights and descriptions of targets. But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that no classified information or war plans were shared, despite what the \"hoax peddlers\" at Atlantic magazine said.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both testified under oath this week that no classified information was discussed, Leavitt said.\n\nLeavitt added that the American people should decide whether the operation was harmed by the chat after reviewing that no U.S. troops were injured while terrorists were killed and their weapons were destroyed.\n\n“I would classify this messaging thread as a policy discussion – a sensitive policy discussion, surely – amongst high-level Cabinet officials and senior staff,” Leavitt said. “The results of this operation should speak for themselves.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump remains confident in national security team: spokesperson\n\nPresident Donald Trump is still confident in this national security team and won’t be firing any of the officials involved in the Signal chat with a reporter that described attack plans against the Houthis, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday.\n\n“The president’s view on all of this remains the same today as it did yesterday,” Leavitt said. “He has placed great trust in his national security team.”\n\nAs for the usage of Signal, Leavitt said it was an approved app for the Defense Department, State Department and CIA.\n\n“It is the most secure way to communicate,” Leavitt said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nNSC, Musk will investigate how reporter got on Signal chat\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the National Security Council, the White House counsel’s office and billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s team will investigate how National Security Adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently included a reporter on a chat about the Houthis strikes.\n\n“Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat, again to take responsibility and make sure that this can never happen again,” Leavitt said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCIA director and House Democrat have testy back and forth over Hegseth’s drinking\n\nRep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., asked CIA Director John Ratcliffe whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was drinking before he “leaked classified information” about a strike on Houthis in Yemen.\n\nRatcliffe responded: “I think that’s an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no.”\n\nAs Hegseth’s nomination as Defense secretary was being considered by the U.S. Senate earlier this year, multiple people raised concerns that he had problematic drinking habits and that he drank on the job. Hegseth denied he has a drinking problem and pledged to quit drinking if he was confirmed.\n\nRatcliffe and Gomez then spoke over each other as the Democratic lawmaker sought to reclaim his time and ask a new question while Ratcliffe sought to explain further.\n\n“This was a question that was on the top of minds of every American,” Gomez argued. “Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nSwing district Republican says White House 'in denial' over Signal chat\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents a House district that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 presidential election, told reporters Wednesday that the Trump administration is “in denial” about The Atlantic’s reporting showing top administration officials sharing sensitive information via a Signal chat that included a journalist.\n\n“The White House is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data,” Bacon said. “They should just own up to it and preserve credibility.”\n\nThe White House and top officials in the chat have denied that classified information was shared.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nNSA Director confirms vulnerability to Signal messaging app\n\nThe senior Trump administration officials' use of Signal to discuss U.S. military attack plans in Yemen continued to come under scrutiny during Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., pressed the National Security Agency's director, Timothy Haugh, on a recent cybersecurity warning to NSA employees revolving around Signal “because there’s risk to that app.”\n\n“There are,” Haugh said.\n\nThe administration’s Russia negotiator, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia while he was in the chat, and Crow asked whether he was on his personal phone. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard replied, “I don’t know.”\n\nGabbard was in the Asia-Pacific when she received the text messages through Signal, she said. But Gabbard said she didn’t remember which country she was in.\n\nCrow said effective leaders “accept responsibility when things go wrong… you set the standard from the top.”\n\n“It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with impunity. No acceptance of responsibility. Excuse after excuse after excuse,” Crow said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTop Democrat on Intel Committee presses Gabbard on Signal chat testimony\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is holding a hearing on Wednesday with top U.S. intelligence officials, including National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Both were members of the Signal chat where sensitive information about a Houthi strike in Yemen was shared.\n\nRanking Member Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., noted that during a Senate hearing on Tuesday both Gabbard and Ratcliffe were asked whether the Signal chat included information on weapons, packages, targets or timing in the Yemen strike.\n\nHimes asked Gabbard whether she would like to reflect on that answer, given the messages showing those details were in a story published by The Atlantic on Wednesday morning.\n\n“My answer yesterday were based on my recollection or the lack thereof on the details that were posted there,” Gabbard said.\n\nHimes also raised the office’s guidance for classification that indicates information providing advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack “should be classified as top secret.”\n\nGabbard said “I don’t disagree with that,” but added that the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, has the authority to classify or declassify information.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nNSA director says Signal chat information 'would be classified' if intercepted\n\nNational Security Agency Director Timothy Haugh testified during Wednesday's House Intelligence Committee hearing that he'd consider the information at the center of the leaked Signal chat \"classified\" had it been intercepted from Russia or China.\n\n“It would be classified” based on our collection methods, Haugh said in response to a question from Rep. Julian Castro, D-Texas.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nGabbard calls Signal chat leak a 'mistake'\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that it was a “mistake” for a journalist to be added to the Signal chat where officials shared intelligence information about a U.S. military strike on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nThe National Security Council is conducting “an in-depth review” of how The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to the chat, but “there were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” she said, despite screenshots of the messages The Atlantic published Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Signal messaging app “comes pre-installed on government devices,” Gabbard added, and administration officials were encouraged to use it to communicate, though in-person conversations are ideal.\n\nGabbard said she is now “limited in (her) ability” to comment on the case because of a lawsuit that has since been filed against the administration over the mishap.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nSenate Democrat says Signal leak 'a crime in my view'\n\nThe details released by Hegseth in the Signal group texts were clearly classified and “is a crime in my view,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday in an interview.\n\n“This is information at the very top of the pyramid as to what should be kept secret and classified,” Blumenthal told USA TODAY. “He should resign. There is no question that he has betrayed his trust.”\n\nPilots who have flown missions to attack Houthi targets have described to Blumenthal “sophisticated, effective air defenses that put them in jeopardy without advanced word they are coming. The idea that he revealed times, the weapon systems and target is a crime in my view.”\n\nIt’s baffling, Blumenthal said, that Hegseth wouldn’t have used secure communications because he has an aide at his side to provide them.\n\n“To disclose this information on Signal on what we are using to strike targets and when shows incompetence,” Blumenthal said. “It’s unconscionable.”\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nJudge targeted by Trump for impeachment assigned to Signal chat lawsuit\n\nU.S. District Chief Judge James Boasberg, a D.C. federal judge whom President Donald Trump has said should be impeached, was assigned to handle a new lawsuit dealing with Trump administration officials' use of a Signal chat to discuss planned military strikes in Yemen.\n\nThe March 18 Trump post on Truth Social for Boasberg and other judges to face impeachment garnered a rare public rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said appealing decisions rather than impeaching judges was the right way to deal with losing in court.\n\nTrump was angry because Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order to halt deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that Trump is trying to invoke to get around the typical legal process for deportations.\n\nBoasberg is now assigned to hear a lawsuit brought by American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog alleging Trump officials' didn't comply with the Federal Records Act when it came to preserving records tied the Signal chat communications, which the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg saw when he was included – seemingly by mistake – in the chat.\n\nSome messages in the chat were set to disappear after one week and some after four weeks, according to Goldberg's firsthand account.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee hearing opens with warnings from top Republican and Democrat\n\nTwo of the officials that were included in the Signal chat - Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe - are testifying Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee for its annual threats hearing.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., opened the hearing with top intelligence officials by acknowledging that the Signal messaging scandal dominated the Senate's analogous hearing on Tuesday. He said he hoped Wednesday's hearing would focus more on the national security threats facing the U.S. government.\n\n“I have deep concerns about the state of our national security,” he said.\n\nRanking Member Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the committee, slammed the Trump administration’s approach to foreign policy and national security, but made it clear that he would be asking about the Signal chat.\n\n“After these last two months, I’m worried the call might be coming from inside the house,” he said. “As far as I can tell, we’re on team Kremlin.”\n\nNow we know that people “in the most dangerous and sensitive jobs on the planet” put sensitive information into a Signal chat that could be intercepted by the Russians and the Chinese, he said.\n\n“I think it’s by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now,” Himes said.\n\n⁃ Riley Beggin\n\nAtlantic releases attack plans discussed by Trump officials in Signal chat\n\nThe Atlantic magazine on Wednesday released the full text chain from Hegseth and other top Trump officials detailing operations to carry out U.S. military airstrikes in a Signal chat group with a reporter present after the White House denied \"war plans\" had been shared.\n\nThe Atlantic's editor-in-chief revealed in a new report what Hegseth told the \"Houthi PC Small Group\" on March 15 before the U.S. conducted airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi sites and during the operation.\n\nThe report includes screen shots of the group texts, which detail drone targets, sequencing of the attacks and the type of weaponry used.\n\nGoldberg and fellow Atlantic reporter Shane Harris said The Atlantic had previously withheld publicizing Hegseth's texts out of concern for the sensitive nature of the information. Goldberg had been mistakenly invited to the chat and was observing the group's conversations, unbeknownst to the 18 Trump officials in the chat.\n\nBut after Trump officials insisted Tuesday that no classified material was shared in the chat ‒ and downplayed the gravity of the breach ‒ the magazine's journalists said they decided to disclose the messages to let people \"reach their own concussions.\"\n\nTrump's White House on Tuesday continued to dispute the initial Atlantic report about \"war plans\" being discussed in the chat, noting that The Atlantic's headline describes the information as \"attack plans,\" not war plans like Monday's initial story.\n\n\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.\"\n\n- Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/trump-hegseth-hillary-clinton-security-breach/82650695007/", "title": "But her e-mails? Here is how Trump's team reacted to a Hillary ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − In a 2016 appearance on Fox News, the future defense secretary Pete Hegseth repeatedly criticized presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for using a private server for her work as the Obama administration’s secretary of state.\n\n“If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now,” Hegseth said.\n\nAs a Fox News on-air analyst, Hegseth made a lot of comments that year as Clinton's use of a private server became a Republican campaign issue, stirred up a public controversy and sparked an FBI investigation: “Any security professional, military, government or otherwise, would be fired on the spot for this type of conduct and criminally prosecuted for being so reckless with this kind of information,” Hegseth said.\n\n“The fact that she wouldn't be held accountable for this, I think, blows the mind of anyone who's held our nation's secrets dear,” Hegseth added back in 2016, “and who's had a top-secret clearance like I have and others who know that even one hiccup causes a problem.”\n\nNow, Defense Secretary Hegseth and other top Trump administration officials are embroiled in a controversy that brings to mind the drama around Clinton nine years ago.\n\nIn a breach that some national security experts called unprecedented and extraordinarily grave, Hegseth and other members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet were found to be discussing operational war plans about how and when to attack the Iranian-sponsored Houthi militias in Yemen earlier this month. And they appear to have accidentally invited a prominent journalist, The Atlantic magazine's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to their Signal chat – which he wrote about in a bombshell article published Monday and confirmed by the White House.\n\nBut Hegseth wasn’t alone.\n\nVirtually every other person on the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, including the heads of the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have publicly gone on record to say breaches of security protocol should be dealt with harshly and immediately.\n\n'Nobody is above the law'\n\nHere’s Trump Secretary of State Marco Rubio, then the junior Republican senator from Florida, who happened to be running for president when the Clinton controversy broke in 2016: “Nobody is above the law, not even Hillary Clinton,” Rubio told Fox News at the time. “Even though she thinks she is.”\n\nThese past calls for accountability placed several Trump national security officials in a bind after their Yemen bombing chat went public.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, a former top lawyer at Justice and Homeland Security departments, said Trump administration officials appeared to be downplaying the seriousness of the Signal disclosures.\n\n“Operational details of a military operation are classified no matter what,” said Rosenzweig, who was a special advocate for the Justice Department’s Data Protection Review Court, which was established to enhance safeguards for U.S. efforts to collect “signals intelligence” via cellphone and emails. “But more importantly, anybody who called for Hillary Clinton's removal for having emails on her personal server and participated in this Signal thread is incomparably hypocritical and should never be taken seriously when discussing classification matters again.”\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe, a former Republican House lawmaker, told Fox News in response to another more recent controversy, “Mishandling classified information is still a violation of the Espionage Act.” That’s a criminal charge so serious that it can bring the death penalty.\n\nAnd in June 2023, Trump National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said invited him to the Signal chat on Houthi attack plans, also weighed in on the issue of alleged mishandling of classified information by both Clinton and Biden.\n\n“When you have the Clinton emails, on top of the fact that the sitting President of the United States admitted he had documents in his garage,” Waltz told CNN. “… But they didn't prosecute, they didn't go after these folks.”\n\nAnd here's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who said in a March 14 post on X in response to concerns about Trump administration policies and plans being leaked to journalists: “Any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.”\n\nGabbard made that comment on the same day she was in the Signal chat discussing the plans to bomb the Houthi rebels, an action that occurred the very next day.\n\nIn his extensive 2016 Fox News comments about Clinton, Hegseth referenced a problem with mishandling classified information that could become relevant soon in the wake of the Signal chat:\n\n“How damaging is it to your ability to recruit or build allies with others when they are worried that our leaders may be exposing them because of their gross negligence or their recklessness in handling information?” Hegseth asked.\n\n'Learned a lesson'\n\nOn Monday, the White House said it was reviewing how Goldberg, a prominent national security journalist, was accidentally added to the group text. “At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the National Security Council said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump himself appeared to downplay the breach, telling NBC News his national security adviser \"has learned a lesson\" and that he was standing by Waltz.\n\nAs for Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016 in part due to the email controversy, posted The Atlantic story to X on Monday with just seven words in response: \"You have got to be kidding me.\"\n\nIn the home stretch of the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for what most national security experts say is a far less significant security breach with the email server.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and gone to jail for what she did,\" Trump said at a rally in Bangor, Maine in October. And in New Hampshire, Trump followers cheered and chanted \"lock her up!\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Ratcliffe and Gabbard fielded tough questions about the breach at an annual global threats hearing before the Senate Intelligence committee.\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was one of numerous Democrats who clashed with both of them.\n\nWarner asked Gabbard outright about her earlier X post about how any unauthorized release of classified information is “a violation of the law and will be treated as such.”\n\n“So,” Warner said, “if this information is classified, what are you going to do?”\n\n“Senator, two points here,” Gabbard responded. “First of all, there's a difference between inadvertent release versus ... malicious leaks of classified information. The second point is, there was no classified information” discussed in the Signal chat.\n\nGoldberg implied there was, citing specifics that he withheld from publication about specific details and timing of the planned attacks weapons used and even the identities of specific Houthi targets.\n\nWarner then challenged Gabbard and Ratcliffe to “release them publicly” if the chat messages contained no classified information.\n\nHegseth, who did not testify at the Senate Intelligence committee hearing, dodged questions about the Signal chat when asked by reporters on Monday – even though it was he who put targeting information into the unsecured chat, according to Goldberg’s article.\n\n“Nobody was texting war plans, and that’s all I have to say about that,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth also attacked Goldberg, a prize-winning veteran national security journalist and editor, without providing details as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.”\n\nJosh Meyer is USA TODAY's Domestic Security Correspondent.

An hour or so later, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, began testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nCongressional Democrats pressed them about their denials a day earlier that war plans had been shared.\n\nThere are unanswered questions, global repercussions and lessons to be learned about Trump and his highest-ranking advisers.\n\nHere are a few of them.\n\nWhat happened, exactly? Two major flubs.\n\nJust how a journalist was added to a sensitive group chat by national security officials still isn't entirely clear.\n\nWaltz said on Fox News late Tuesday that he took \"full responsibility\" for the breach, but Trump on Newsmax cited a \"junior staffer\" on the National Security Council who had Goldberg's number on his phone as the culprit.\n\n\"We made a mistake,\" Waltz said. Even so, he immediately suggested, without evidence, that Goldberg might have somehow engineered it. \"I didn't see this loser in the group,\" Waltz said. \"Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened (by) some other technical mean(s) is something we're trying to figure out.\"\n\nThe other serious question is why military attack plans were being discussed on a commercial app that is more vulnerable to hacking than the government's secure communications systems.\n\nDuring the group chat, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about the timing, weapons and targets for the attack ahead. He has denied sharing any classified information, although former top military and intelligence officials said there was no question the information was or should have been classified.\n\n\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" Hegseth told reporters Tuesday, adding, \"I know exactly what I'm doing.\"\n\nAfter Trump officials denied that classified information had been revealed, The Atlantic published additional texts from Hegseth, including precise times for the launch of F-18s and identification of their targets. Disclosure of that information to a foe or to the public could have undermined the surprise attack and put the pilots in danger.\n\n\"We are currently clean on OPSEC,\" Hegseth wrote then. That is, on operational security.\n\nWho is to blame? Let's try the messenger.\n\nTrump downplayed the breach and declined to criticize any administration officials involved. \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" he told NBC's Garrett Haake.\n\nBut the president, who for years has hammered Hillary Clinton for jeopardizing security by using a private email server, had harsh words about Goldberg.\n\n\"He's made up a lot of stories and I think he's basically bad for the country,\" Trump said, calling Goldberg a \"sleazebag\" and The Atlantic a \"failed magazine.\"\n\nSince Goldberg became editor in 2016, the Atlantic has won several Pulitzer Prizes, and last year it reported a profit after several years of losses.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump had clashed with Goldberg after he wrote a story quoting Trump as saying Americans who died in war were \"losers\" and \"suckers.\" Trump denied making the statement; his White House chief of staff confirmed it.\n\n\"Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X. She called it \"another hoax, written by a Trump hater.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance said Goldberg had \"oversold what he had\" and retweeted posts disputing The Atlantic's characterization of the texts as \"war plans,\" saying instead they had been \"attack plans.\"\n\nHello, Europe? Vance's independent voice.\n\nAmong the interesting asides in the group chat was Vance sharing his independent views of the pending attack. \"I think we are making a mistake,\" he said, noting that European trade was much more dependent on free passage through the Suez Canal than U.S. trade was.\n\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance texted. He said he would keep his concerns to himself but added, \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\n\nThe vice president's candid role in the debate with Cabinet members − and his suggestion that the president might not understand the geostrategic context − is unusual in this and almost any administration. Trump's vice president in his first term, Mike Pence, almost never let any daylight show between him and the president, including during meetings with other senior officials.\n\nIn the chat that followed, administration officials discussed whether to delay the attack.\n\nVance spokesman William Martin insisted that Vance and Trump were \"in complete agreement.\"\n\nVance's assertion that Europe wasn't paying its full share for its military defense is a familiar one from Trump, but the depth of the vice president's contempt in the chat was notable − and a red flag for NATO leaders already concerned about whether the post-World War II alliance would hold.\n\n\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading,\" Hegseth had replied. \"It's PATHETIC.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/25/war-plans-shared-with-reporter-in-group-chat-infuriate-markey-warren/82648569007/", "title": "'Malpractice' Markey, Warren slam Trump, Hegseth over war plans ...", "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed war plans for a strike on Yemen in a group chat that included a journalist.\n\nSenators across New England lambasted the administration for the security lapse.\n\nMass.

But the lawsuit said the Federal Records Act requires officials such as Waltz, Hegseth and others to preserve their records for the National Archives.\n\n“Using disappearing messaging apps to plan highly sensitive military operations isn't just a transparency problem – it’s a national security crisis and potentially criminal,” Chioma Chukwu, interim executive director of the nonprofit American Oversight, said in a statement. “These officials chose platforms specifically designed to leave no paper trail for decisions that could cost lives and impact global stability.”\n\nDepartments preserving Signal records: DOJ\n\nRicher submitted statements from the Treasury and Defense departments they officials were already working to preserve the records.\n\nChristopher Pilkerton, acting general counsel at Treasury, submitted a statement saying he sent memos Wednesday to Bessent and his chief of staff \"instructing them to take any steps necessary to preserve all existing communications\" including on Signal.\n\nGerald Dziecichowicz, the associate deputy general counsel at Defense, said his office requested copies of the Signal messages at issue in the case from Hegseth's staff.\n\nDOGE tells staffers to save Signal message\n\nAnother American Oversight lawsuit, which seeks documents about cuts in government spending, revealed the Department of Government Efficiency sent a memo Tuesday directing staffers in bold, underlined type to \"preserve all work-related communications and records, regardless of format.\"\n\nThe memo said it applied to memos, letters, notes and drafts including in emails, chats and text messages.\n\n\"If you happen to receive work-related messages on your personal device − whether via text, Signal, a personal email address, or otherwise − make sure to capture and transmit those messages to your work device (such as screenshotting and forwarding,\" the memo said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Former President Donald Trump announces a White House bid for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

For the latest news, view our story for Sunday, Feb. 2.\n\nPHILADELPHIA ‒ A Medevac jet that plummeted from the sky and crashed in a fiery explosion into a busy neighborhood on Friday evening killed at least seven people, injured 19 others and has left a path of carnage.\n\nAs investigators combed the area for evidence on Saturday, residents were still reeling from the sight of the crash. People gathered in the Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood from dawn to mid-afternoon to see what remained of Friday's nightmare. They stood yards away from a debris field of broken plane pieces and singed cars to get a glimpse of the wreckage.\n\nA huge crater was blown out of the city street where a Learjet 55 carrying six Mexican nationals nosedived into the ground at almost 300 mph, according to initial reports. There were two chunks of the plane’s charred fuselage in the street. Several cars caught in the blast during the evening rush rested at extreme angles ‒ one was so thoroughly incinerated that only a blackened metal skeleton remained.\n\nMany described the moment the plane hit as akin to a war zone. Andre Boldin said the jet sounded like a missile sputtering overhead. Nearby, Andre Gary said he believed the world was ending as he watched it fall like a meteor from the sky.\n\n“I couldn’t sleep last night,” said Bill Vitelli, whose windows rattled when the jet crashed. \"We’ll know what happened, eventually, but why do these things happen? Maybe only God can explain it.”\n\nDeaths and injuries reported\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker on Saturday morning confirmed that all six people on the plane died, along with one person who was in their car when the medical flight struck the ground, hurtling debris far and wide. She and other officials warned that the count of injured and dead could rise as recovery efforts continue.\n\nShe thanked first responders and said crews and investigators worked through the night and will continue to work to learn what happened.\n\n\"We will find a cause for this tragedy,\" she said.\n\nThe six people on board the jet were from Mexico, including a young girl ‒ who had been treated at Shriners Children's Philadelphia, her mother, a medical crew, and the pilots, said Jet Rescue Air Ambulance Spokesperson Shai Gold.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the deaths and offered condolences to the families impacted in a Saturday morning post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the jet departed from Northeast Philadelphia Airport and crashed around 6:30 p.m. Friday as it was headed to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri. The plane crashed near the Roosevelt Mall at Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard, a busy hub with dozens of businesses and hundreds of homes.\n\nThe crash in Philadelphia comes in the wake of the midair collision in Washington D.C. that killed 67 people. The collision of an Army helicopter and American Airlines plane in the nation's capital was the deadliest U.S. passenger air crash in over two decades.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators are investigating the crash site, and the FAA said it will assist with the probe.\n\nSearch for missing cockpit recorder\n\nIt took \"a slight right turn, followed by a slight left turn and then a steep descent,\" leading to its crash, NTSB investigator Ralph Hicks said in a press briefing Saturday.\n\n\"This was a high-impact crash and the plane is highly fragmented, ​​​​​​​​​​​​NTSB chairman Jennifer Homendy said at the briefing.\n\nAs a result, there is a lot of debris, much of which investigators are looking to collect. The collection effort could take weeks, Homendy said.\n\nWhile investigators have found the plane's two engines, they have yet to find the cockpit voice recorder. She urged anyone who found debris to email the NTSB (witness@ntsb.gov).\n\nAbout the cockpit recorder, which may not be intact, Homendy said, \"hopefully, once we can find it … we can take that back to our lab and evaluate it.\"\n\nFinding the recorder is \"critical, so we can hear what's happening in the cockpit,\" she said. \"However, it doesn't mean that we can't continue our investigation and complete it (without the voice recorder). We can. It's just a piece of our investigation that gives us more information.\"\n\nPoliticians respond to the disaster\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro thanked federal officials for help investigating the crash and stressed a message of unity in the face of tragedy.\n\n\"This is not just a group of emergency response professionals working together at the state, local and federal level, this is neighbors working together to look out for one another,\" he said Saturday morning.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday night applauded first responders and offered his condolences to the victims in a Truth Social post.\n\n\"So sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More innocent souls lost,\" Trump wrote. \"Our people are totally engaged. First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job. More to follow. God Bless you all.\"\n\nPhiladelphia air traffic control tried to reach doomed plane\n\nAir traffic control communications reveal the moments when controllers tried to reach the doomed jet.\n\nThe Medevac pilot did not mention any issues over the radio, but the air traffic control tower caught on that something was wrong.\n\n“Medevac med service zero-five-six, northeast tower, are you on frequency?” a controller asks almost four minutes after the jet's takeoff from Northeast Philadelphia Airport in an audio file downloaded from liveatc.net.\n\nMinutes later another voice came on: What's going on down there?\"\n\n\"We have a lost aircraft,\" the operator responds.\n\nRead more.\n\nCrews inspect crash site\n\nAdam Thiel, managing director of the City of Philadelphia, said crews are conducting house-to-house operations around the area of the crash to find any hidden damage. It could be days, he said, before the full extent of the tragedy is known.\n\nHe estimated the area of impact to be roughly four to six blocks wide. But debris also spread into areas farther away.\n\nPhiladelphia fire officials said five homes were set ablaze, but they had since been extinguished. Officials did not say how many cars were impacted.\n\nWhat is a Medevac jet?\n\nShort for “medical evacuation,” Medevac flights are undertaken by aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, including ventilators, defibrillators, and monitoring devices along with caregivers to provide inflight care for patients being transported to a medical facility, according to aviation news site Simple Flying.\n\nStaffed by specially trained medical personnel, the aircraft are \"essentially flying ambulances,\" according to Fly REVA, an international air ambulance provider with bases of operation in Arizona, Florida, New York and Puerto Rico.\n\nHelicopters can be used as Medevac aircraft, but fixed-wing planes such as the Learjet are ideal for use because they can take off and land on shorter airfields. Large cargo doors allow for loading and unloading of a stretcher, the site says.\n\nMedical crew on a Medevac can include intensive care physicians, flight doctors and flight nurses, notes Medical Air Service Worldwide, an air ambulance provider with offices in New York and London.\n\nEquipment on an Medevac flight may include a satellite phone, an intensive care unit, respirator, defibrillator, blood gas analyzer and oxygen tanks, the company says.\n\nPilots may have additional medical training including infection control and patient loading and unloading, according to MedicTests, an evaluation site.\n\n– Mike Snider\n\nChild aboard plane was in Philadelphia for treatment\n\nJet Rescue was contracted to transport the child from Philadelphia to Tijuana, Mexico, Gold said. Gold confirmed a third-party charitable organization paid for the flight, but he couldn’t divulge the name of the organization.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the families,” Gold said. “It’s really an irreplaceable loss.”\n\nShriner's Hospital Philadelphia said they had been treating the girl and celebrated her with a sendoff Friday before the flight, according to an interview a hospital representative gave to CBS3 in Philadelphia.\n\nThe company previously experienced a fatal crash in 2023 in Mexico where five crew members were lost, Gold said.\n\nThe LearJet 55 is one of the largest available and Jet Rescue is among the few air ambulance companies that use them because they are expensive, but an “exceptionally reliable jet.” Jet Rescue flies 600 to 700 flights a year around the world and that the number of trips the LearJet 55 took the five days before the crash is not unusual, Gold said.\n\nHe added that the company training for its crew exceeds the industry standard, the airplanes in its fleet are “well-maintained” and safety is taken extremely seriously, calling each flight a “holy mission.”\n\n“Every flight is like it’s the first flight we ever did,” Gold said. “IF a red light goes on in the cockpit, the plane is grounded no matter where it is.”\n\n'Help us, help us'\n\nPhiladelphia resident Michael Hitchner was sitting in a parked car when the plane crashed nearby. He said he used his shirt to try to stop the bleeding from a child's head who was injured from debris that fell through a car windshield.\n\n\"The parents were shouting, 'Help us, help us, help us!'\" Hitchner said. He added that he and his wife saw other carnage as well. \"My wife saw a disembodied foot. I saw a disembodied arm. I saw medical supplies scattered everywhere,\" Hitchner said.\n\n\"It was a very shocking and disturbing experience, seeing everything that happened. I got home. I threw up twice.\"\n\n– Jim Walsh\n\nWhat does the National Transportation Safety Board do?\n\nThe NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with investigating civil transportation accidents in the U.S. involving aircraft, railways, roads and on the water, according to the NTSB website.\n\nThe agency, headed by a five-member board, is currently investigating the midair collision of an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday.\n\nHow many planes have crashed in 2025?\n\nSo far in the U.S. there have been eight airplane crashes – including bird strikes and single craft accidents – based on information from the Aviation Safety Network.\n\nPrior to the crash of a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday, there had been no fatalities in the U.S. this year.\n\nThat crash left 67 dead. With the fatalities in the Philadelphia crash, there's now been 74 air crash-related deaths in the U.S. in 2025.\n\n'No donations' needed, mayor says\n\nMayor Parker urged those looking for ways to help victims of the tragedy to pray for the City of Philadelphia and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. She stressed that \"no donations are needed at this time,\" during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nShe said officials were working on creating \"formal, actionable ways\" for people to assist with the tragedy.\n\nDetails about plane emerge\n\nAccording to the online flight-tracking service Flight Aware, the red and white plane is a 43-year-old Learjet 55 registered to Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, which has operations in Miami and Mexico.\n\nIn recent days, the plane had passed through airports in Mexico, Haiti, Florida and Arizona. On the company's website, the plane is featured in a video explaining how Jet Rescue can extract patients worldwide and is shown in the air as the video touts the company's \"impeccable safety record.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Jet Rescue for comment.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes and Eduardo Cuevas, USA TODAY; Jim Walsh, USA TODAY Network; Bucks County Courier Times; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/10/27/letters-to-the-editor-for-sunday-october-27-2024/75779683007/", "title": "Letters to the editor for Sunday, October 27, 2024", "text": "Letter writers\n\nGannett\n\nLetters to the editor should be 250 words or less.

Special interest groups (i.e., NRA, NSSF, and sportsmen’s organizations) introduced the amendment to the Legislature in 2023 for this year’s ballot. Floridians already have a statutory right to hunt and fish (Florida Statutes 379.104) so why is this amendment necessary? Supporters say it’s designed to protect these rights against attacks by animal rights extremists, yet there have been zero efforts in Florida to overturn them. So, what is the real reason behind the amendment? The amendment seeks to enshrine traditional hunting methods in our Constitution. This could open the door to the baiting of bears, hunting bears with dogs, the use of inhumane trapping devices, etc. The amendment also seeks to make hunting the preferred means of managing wildlife. This could limit the use of non-lethal options designed to protect both people and wildlife. This could also allow for expanded hunting opportunities (for both Floridians and foreigners), extended seasons, and perhaps another bear hunt. Florida’s fish and wildlife already face serious threats to their survival. No special interest group(s) should be given an exclusive constitutional right of access to Florida’s dwindling wildlife resources. The FWC is obligated under the Public Trust Doctrine to carry out its Mission of “Managing fish and wildlife resources for their long-term well-being and the benefit of people.” Existing statutory rights and sound management represent the best options for conserving wildlife resources that belong to ALL Floridians.\n\nNeed a break?

A recent article listed comments from 91 of these people, along with past advisers and military officers who make a case Trump's past behavior (never forget January 6th) and his obsession on revenge make him unfit for this office.\n\nPlease consider Project 2025's destructive potential impact with Trump's leadership without past guardrails from strong patriotic advisers.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher, our country needs your vote not Trump.\n\nJames Keough, Cape Coral\n\nInflation lurks in tax cuts, tariffs\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the causes of recent U.S. inflation, but they are multifactorial and certainly not due exclusively to the policies of the Biden administration. Rather, they are due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and its unanticipated effects on supply and demand, deglobalization, the Trump Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and its effects on consumer demand, the Biden administration’s exuberant support of the economy during the pandemic, and the prolonged low interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve. Going forward, we must be aware that an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and further deglobalization induced by tariffs could stimulate a return of rapidly rising prices.\n\nInflation is a complex entity, caused by an elevated money supply, and the interaction between the supply and demand for products. The pandemic interrupted manufacturing and decreased the supply of countless products, making them scarce and pushing up their prices. At the same time, people focused on their home environment and increased their demand for the products we use at home, pushing up their prices. Later, as we came out of the pandemic, the demand for leisure and travel services increased, all while supplies of these services were still low, pushing up their prices as well. The increased money supply, facilitated by the Trump tax cuts, the Biden and congressional programs to support the COVID economy, and the low interest rates offered by the Fed, put more money in the hands of consumers, and increased demand and prices even more. Now, the pandemic and associated government support are behind us, and the Fed has increased interest rates, eliminating some of the causes of recent inflation. Let us not bring about more inflation with an extension of the Trump taxes that benefit only a small portion of the population, nor with indiscriminate tariffs that will further raise prices, as well as interfere with global trade and alliances.\n\nDavid S. Goodman, MD, BA Economics, Naples\n\nTrump’s menacing threat\n\nMany of us still remember the horror of May 4, 1970, when members of the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed students at Kent State University who were protesting the war in Vietnam. When the bullets stopped flying and the carnage assessed, four students lay dead on the ground and nine others were injured, one permanently paralyzed. In the outrage that followed, President Richard Nixon’s Commission on Campus Unrest concluded that the Kent State tragedy must mark the last time loaded rifles are issued to guardsmen confronting demonstrators.Sadly, the tragedy of Kent State 54 years ago is a history lesson wasted on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump’s menacing threat to use the military to shoot protesters in the legs or feet or crack their skulls sends a chilling message of deja vu. He must never have the power to unleash military might on citizens engaged in peaceful protest.\n\nSusan Stranahan, Fort Myers\n\nHeed warnings about Trump\n\nA few Sundays ago, the New York Times ran a feature with 93 people saying why Trump is unfit to be president. These people include leaders of nations, politicians, family members and many who worked directly for him as Cabinet members and close staff members. These are people who know the man intimately. We should heed their warnings. Gavin de Becker, the author of the \"Gift of Fear,\" says when someone shows or tells you who they are, believe them. Trump has given us more than enough evidence to reject him. Please believe these people who saw him up close and personal. Trump and Vance support Project 2025 which if enacted will drastically change our way of government and our lives. Please take some time to research this document and the Trump loyalists behind it.\n\nKaren Smith, Estero\n\nChoice should be easy\n\nIf your source for news is the only major network to pay nearly one billion dollars for lying then you can probably skip this letter.Your vote for the president of the United States is the greatest responsibility you have at this moment. The choice should be an easy one: The convicted felon or the respected prosecutor; the self-proclaimed sexual abuser or the beloved step-mom; the candidate who hides his tax returns or the one making full disclosure; youth, intelligence and integrity or a 78-year-old, mentally addled and corrupt has been.Let’s move on from the hateful, chaotic Trump years and enter a new era of hopeful and positive leadership with Harris.\n\nDaniel Graziano, Naples\n\nBiblical passage\n\nProverbs 6:16-19 states: \"There are six things the Lord hates, seven are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.\"\n\nWhile reading the above biblical passage, did a particular presidential candidate come to mind? If so, then you'd be advised to vote for his political opponent.\n\nJames L. DeBoy, Fort Myers\n\nTrump is not OK\n\nWhat do I really know about Kamala Harris? Not all that much. If I'm being honest, I haven't known much about most of the candidates I've voted for over the years. I've been guided by a general sense of the person picked up primarily from the media. And I haven't always been right. For instance, I thought Bill Clinton was terrific, and he turned out to be a major league sleaze bag. But that was my process. I learned what I could about the candidates and voted from the heart. And on that basis, Kamala seems OK to me.Here's something new, though. I know a whole lot about Donald Trump simply because the man is incapable of shutting his mouth. There is no \"seems\" where he's concerned. He tells me and everyone listening who and what he is every day. And what he tells us could not be more simple. He is a very bad person. He is not OK. The evidence to support this is on tape going all the way back to his genital grabbing comment and beyond.Of course, his supporters still have every right to vote for him in November, but they should not kid themselves about what they're doing. They are potentially giving almost unlimited power (including the nuclear codes) to the kind of man they would never have over for Thanksgiving. And that is not OK.\n\nGeremy Spampinato, Naples\n\nPartisan leftist operation\n\nIt’s rich that the NDN failed to mention DNC lawsuits by Harris’s campaign attorney, Marc Elias, in their Sunday article where they attacked GOP lawsuits.The longtime Dem Party lawyer has already filed more than 60 pre-election lawsuits to stop Trump from becoming president again by combatting what he calls Republican “voter suppression” efforts by requiring voters to provide ID at the polls.At the same time, Elias has been sending letters to election officials in GA and other swing states threatening legal action if they uphold challenges to voter rolls to remove non-citizens and other ineligible registrants.If Trump wins, Elias threatens to overturn Trump’s election by deploying an army of more than 75 lawyers to sue for ballot recounts in several swing states.“Mr. Elias is part of a massive and well-funded partisan leftist operation notorious for using lawfare to undermine election integrity,” says Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch.As general counsel to Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, he helped lead the effort to manufacture and leak spurious “opposition research” claiming to reveal illicit ties between Trump and Russia. All proven false by the Durham report.My question is: What are they afraid of by requiring voter ID? It is required for everything else in life. Elias is also threatening states to certify the votes before they have been verified legally. That is not democracy; it’s condoning cheating.\n\nLori Borman, Naples\n\nRisk to Social Security\n\nLiving in Naples for almost ten years the lifestyle benefit from our monthly Social Security is a major economic engine in Collier County and across Florida.I’m alarmed by nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget report that Donald Trump’s plan for senior citizens would deplete Social Security funds in just 6 years, 72 months.President Trump’s trickledown first term nonsense did nothing for seniors who are disproportionately dependent on our monthly Social Security. Now his malicious plans cloaked in lies will leave seniors worse off and with the hovering threat of the end of Social Security.This is not right. This is why, as a former Republican, I’ve voted for Veep Kamala Harris.\n\nHarvey Cohen, Naples\n\nLesser of two evils\n\nWell here we are again. Once again we're forced to vote for the lesser of two evils. Well when faced with this; I take the one I've not tried before. Trump inherited a good economy from President Obama; then trashed it. So, I really think, Trump doesn't deserve another chance.\n\nRobert Jenkins, Naples\n\nSteelers' Terrible Towel\n\nThe fans in Pittsburgh revere the Terrible Towel which was created by Myron Cope, a deceased commentator, and they wave it in their home venue Heinz Field (now Acrisure). These towels also show up all over the country as Steeler followers are the best travelers in the entire NFL. On game day they are draped all over room where the game would be watched. These black and gold symbols of rabid fans are sacred to them and to see Elon Musk sporting one in the Burgh was tantamount to blasphemy. His blowhard leader was behind glass in a private box and his presence was not announced as he would have been subjected to a cacophony of boos. Pittsburgh is not favorable to that ticket since, even though its voters are no longer blue shirt, they are still much smarter than given credit for. The job and COVID losses during his tenure are still fresh in their minds.\n\nSo, thanks for wasting time there. Kamala appreciates it.\n\nGlenn Chenot, Cape Coral\n\nCome on, guys!\n\nI just saw a poll showing Mr. Trump 16 points ahead among men.Come on, guys! Are you that insecure about your masculinity that you think voting for a strong, intelligent woman makes you into what Mr. Trump thinks he has the right to grab?Based on the brave Republican women who fearlessly speak out against Mr. Trump, while weakling men hide under their desks, it appears that \"man up\" is no longer an accurate term for strength and bravery.The more fitting term for strength and bravery is \"woman up.\" So come on guys! Woman up!\n\nJ. Cant, Naples\n\nMcDonald's and Trump\n\nMcDonald Trump for president.\n\nMichael Adler, Miromar Lakes\n\nSave our democracy\n\nIt is not who you want. It is what you want from the coming election. The candidates are not at stake here. What is at stake is our democracy. The party once called Republican does not exist on our ballots today. What is on the ballot today is democracy versus fascism. Fascism is a political ideology characterized by a centralized autocratic government, a dictatorial leader, and the suppression of opposition.\n\nOnly by voting Blue can we save our democracy: a democracy where women have rights over their bodies and their lives, where global warming is brought under control, or reasonable gun controls over assault weapons and background checks are implemented, or efficacious legislation is achieved by way of negotiation and compromise, where truth is again honored as a virtue, lies are no longer used to manipulate policies, where citizens’ rights to health and the pursuit of happiness are recognized and where world peace becomes an objective not an obstacle.\n\nFacts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. When it comes to fascism, we cannot bury our heads in the sand.\n\nVote Blue. Save our democracy.\n\nSally Lam, Naples\n\nWarning signs of psychopath\n\nPsychopath. noun, Psy-cho-path: a mentally unstable person, especially: a person having an egocentric and antisocial personality marked by a lack of remorse for one's actions, an absence of empathy for others, and often criminal tendencies (Merriam-Webster). I would encourage your readers to check the 10 warning signs of a psychopath. One of the candidates vying for our highest office checks off all ten boxes.\n\nKevin Shanosky, Naples\n\nSkewed values\n\nI am saddened but not surprised by your recent reader’s comment that he votes with his wallet. Saddened by his materialism, but not surprised by his party affiliation. Whatever happened to morals, generosity, education, honesty and experience when deciding on who you vote for as president of the United States? Gone with the wind!\n\nJon Pipkin, Naples\n\nOutrageous attack\n\nHow can it be that the DeSantis administration has approved extending the 2024 high school football season due to the interruptions of Helene and Milton but refused to extend the voter registration deadline? It is possible that they are too busy weaponizing the state against a very popular democratic effort to put an issue before the public via a ballot amendment \"Yes on 4.\" DeSantis and his surgeon general's outrageous attack on media that support the women's health proposal is beyond belief.\n\nWe continue to see more reasons why we need new leadership in Florida.\n\nRay Nord, Naples\n\nImpotent foreign policy\n\nThe British and French left the post-mandate Middle East in disarray and American leaders who were either uninformed or delusional about Arabs and Muslims have only compounded their mistakes.In the wake of the Six Day War their fantasy that Israel could not survive a coordinated Muslim attack was replaced by the delusion that peace could only be achieved by protecting its enemies from defeat and the consequences of their aggression. Over 80 years, numerous wars, countless terror attacks and a medieval bloodbath our “commitment” to Israel’s defense has also precluded its victory.Barack Obama believed that Israel was not only indefensible, but expendable, and that the best way to extricate us from our commitment was by making her, along with our Arab allies, semi-autonomous provinces in a nuclear threshold neo-Ottoman Empire.President Trump shattered that policy and delivered a stable Middle East to the Biden-Harris administration which instantly trashed the Abraham Accords, humiliated itself in Afghanistan, vowed to make Saudi Arabia “a pariah state” accountable for war crimes in Yemen, then groveled before it for oil as gas prices spiked.The administration was proven irrelevant when Israel ignored its warnings and dismantled Hamas and Hezbollah. Now it is cowering behind shop-worn buzz words like “proportionality” and “preventing a wider war” to protect its Iranian allies against retaliation for their ballistic missile attacks on central Israel. Being unreliable, obnoxious, obsequious, and impotent is a dangerous substitute for a foreign policy, particularly in honor bound, traditional societies.It would do well to recall Winston Churchill’s response to the 1938 Munich Agreement. “You were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.”\n\nAllen Menkin, MD, Naples\n\nCharacter, decency count\n\nToday, I received word via email that my vote has been counted in Collier County. I am proud to have voted for a woman of character; a woman who doesn’t lie constantly; a woman who doesn’t make fun of handicapped persons/children; a woman who does not vilify others but speaks for the disenfranchised; a woman who has not been found guilty of 34 felonies; a woman who believes that reproductive rights should be determined between a woman and her doctor, not Congress; a woman I would be proud to call Madame President. As a lifelong Christian, I believe that character and decency count far more than any policy. I believe that is what Jesus would do.\n\nNancy Pointer, Naples\n\nTrump continues to deteriorate\n\nRepublicans nationwide seem to be uniform in embracing the Trump candidacy as a potential savior for our nation. Remembering Trump's quote from his first election that he \"loves the uneducated voter,\" it appears he has been successful in drawing them to his campaign of hate and fear in droves. Obviously some educated people also support this old buffoon in his quest to \"get even\" with all of his opponents, but in doing so expose their values as being similar to Trump's, and that is obviously nothing of which they should be proud. Here's a thought that ought to bring a chill down your spine. Trump's rallies (particularly Wednesday night in which he spent 39 minutes playing music and dancing and swaying on stage after taking five questions at a town hall in heat that resulted in two people fainting) have increasingly reflected a diminution of his cognitive abilities. He's old, substantially obese, and often rambles when speaking. He seems to have no understanding of reality (attending an economic summit discussing the effect of raising tariffs, he told the economists questioning him that he was better at math than they were). But that's not the chilling part. Try this on for size! Trump continues to deteriorate, if elected, and can't continue in office. All hail President J.D. Vance. Again, that's President J.D. Vance. Doesn't sound any better the second time, does it? If that thought doesn't scare you then it's clear that some sort of IQ test should be administered as part of the voter registration process. Just saying.\n\nRobert F. Tate, Naples\n\nTrump is dangerous\n\nThink about this, Donald Trump has said he wants to deny California fire assistance. What would happen if the federal government refused to help Florida after a hurricane? This person must not be elected, he is dangerous.\n\nWith all the election bickering about national issues foreign relations have taken a back seat. On this week’s program Fareed Zakaria, one of the most astute and experienced foreign policy analysts, stated that we are in a period of extreme international danger from an alliance of Russia, China and Iran. This is a direct threat to the U.S. and its Western allies. It will take experienced diplomacy and steady guidance to get through this peacefully. Donald Trump has been labeled an outright fascist by his former top military and civilian defense personnel and his unstable judgment will most likely lead us to ruin. His rambling incoherent mental state is wrong for our national security. What good is disrupting the country with alien expulsions or spending billions on walls when our security is endangered. A vote for him is a vote against American security.\n\nBenjamin Glick, Naples", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/27"}]}

Joni Ernst's military relationships", "text": "Robert Faturechi\n\nProPublica\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica.\n\nEarlier this year, the Air Force revealed that the general who oversaw its lobbying before Congress had inappropriate romantic relationships with five women, including three who worked on Capitol Hill.\n\nMaj. Gen. Christopher Finerty’s colleagues told investigators the relationships were “highly inappropriate” as they could give the Air Force undue influence in Congress. “I honestly felt sick to my stomach,” one said, according to a report about the investigation, “because it just felt so sleazy.”\n\nThe Air Force inspector general’s report redacted the names of the women who worked on the Hill.\n\nBut one of the women whose relationship with Finerty was scrutinized by the inspector general was Sen. Joni Ernst, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation. The Iowa Republican and combat veteran is one of the most influential voices on the Hill about the military, and she sits on the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, which oversees the Pentagon and plays a crucial role in setting its annual budget.\n\nThree other sources told ProPublica that around 2019 Ernst had a previous romantic relationship with a legislative affairs official for a different branch of the military, the Navy.\n\nErnst and the officials were not married at the time, and Senate rules do not bar lawmakers from entering into romantic relationships with lobbyists or other legislative advocates. But ethics experts say such relationships can create a conflict of interest, and other lawmakers have been criticized for such behavior in the past.\n\nA former legislative affairs official for the military told ProPublica that people in that role aren’t officially “lobbyists but for all intent and purposes that’s their job. … From an ethics standpoint, it’s severely problematic.”\n\nA former Air Force officer who worked for Finerty said the perception in the office was that his relationship with Ernst “absolutely gave the Air Force undue influence.”\n\nSix sources who worked for the Air Force or in Congress told ProPublica that they had heard about a relationship between Ernst and Finerty and there had been concerns about it for years. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly or feared for their jobs.\n\nOne source said that they were told about the relationship by one of the two participants. Two sources said they heard from witnesses interviewed by the inspector general that Ernst was a focus of the investigation.\n\nA spokesperson for Ernst would not address whether the senator had any relationships with military legislative liaisons but said the lawmaker maintained her independence: “The fake news media is clearly too busy gossiping to report the real news that Senator Ernst is focused on cutting waste at the Pentagon. Her votes and work in the Senate are guided by the voices of Iowans who elected her and her constitutional duty alone. Any insinuation otherwise by tabloid ‘journalism’ is a slanderous lie — full stop.”\n\nFinerty’s lawyer also declined to say whether the general had a romantic relationship with Ernst while he was advocating for the Air Force in Congress. “The IG report found no evidence suggesting anything remotely approaching either conflict of interest or undue influence involving General Finerty and anyone on Capitol Hill. Further, the IG report found no law, rule, policy or guidance prohibited any of General Finerty’s relationships. Any suggestion to the contrary would be defamatory.” (The inspector general report said Finerty “wrongfully engaged in inappropriate relationships with multiple individuals” in violation of the code of military justice.) In his interview with the inspector general, according to the report, Finerty defended relationships between people in his office and “members on the Hill” — a term used to describe members of Congress.\n\nThe 41-page report documenting the inspector general’s investigation of Finerty was completed in September 2023 but was shared with Congress, and then the public, earlier this year in response to records requests. (The investigation summary, posted on the Air Force’s website, was reported first by Politico, without any mention of Ernst’s involvement.)\n\nAt the time of the report’s release to Congress in early January, Ernst’s influence over the Pentagon was on full display, as she sat at the center of one of the Trump administration’s most contentious confirmation battles. Ernst had made statements suggesting she had reservations about President Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and though she had later made encouraging statements, she had refused to formally back him.\n\nServing in the Iowa Army National Guard during the Iraq War, Ernst is the Senate’s first female combat veteran and has pushed to reform the military’s handling of sexual assault cases. Hegseth faced scrutiny over past allegations of excessive drinking and sexual assault, which he denied, as well as criticism for comments he made against allowing women in combat. Then in mid-January, Ernst reversed course under pressure from Trump allies and formally endorsed Hegseth. Her backing was considered pivotal in reviving what had appeared to be a flailing nomination.\n\nThe report about Finerty is heavily redacted but provided the following details about the inspector general’s findings. Two of the five women worked for the Pentagon. They include a civilian employee who was married to another officer and an Air Force enlisted member significantly lower down the chain of command than Finerty. Finerty interacted with the three other women on Capitol Hill as part of his legislative affairs work, “mixing his professional and personal roles, thus creating the perception of a conflict of interest.” Finerty sexted two of those women in 2021. He sexted and had an “intimate relationship” with the third, though the report does not say exactly when.\n\nThe nature of his relationship with the women varied, from suggestive messages to graphic sexting and photos to physical sex, according to the report. Sources told ProPublica that the inspector general asked witnesses about Ernst, but because of the redactions in the report, it’s unclear which sections, if any, refer to the senator.\n\nThe report includes a stark example of Finerty’s legislative advocacy overlapping with his romantic relationship with one of the women on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn June 2021, Finerty texted the woman “I was distracted by you being distracted.” Then he sent her a list of “top 5 things to protect if possible,” including a particular fighter jet, radar technology and a system to improve interoperability across the military’s branches.\n\n“What distraction?” the woman texted back. “If I was [redacted] would it be distracting?” She followed up with a series of what the inspector general report described as pornographic pictures.\n\nFinerty told investigators that his romantic relationships with the women on Capitol Hill were proper because all participants were unmarried.\n\n“Those weren’t Chris Finerty’s personal interest items. Those were the five things that were in the President’s Budget that we’re charged to go up there and ensure that we get across the finish line,” he said, according to the report. “I wasn’t saying hey, do me a personal favor and protect these five things. It was, these are the five things that the Air Force has in the President’s Budget that we’re trying to do that we need your help with.”\n\nMany of Finerty’s colleagues who were also working in military legislative affairs took a more negative view. In interviews with investigators, they expressed concerns about the relationships leading to undue influence, other military branches perceiving the Air Force as getting preferential treatment, and other congressional offices worrying they were less likely to receive sensitive information.\n\nThe inspector general’s investigation found “several exchanges between Maj Gen Finerty and the women regarding legislative matters” but “no evidence of favors or exchanging of sensitive information by either party.”\n\nRegarding one of the Hill relationships, a colleague of Finerty’s told investigators, “Was there a perception in my office that it was unethical? Yes.” The colleague reported it affected morale and people were “talking about it all the time.”\n\nAnother military legislative affairs official was more blunt, calling the relationships “totally unprofessional” because “I think it compromises the integrity of the entire Department of the Air Force.”\n\nThe inspector general concluded Finerty had violated the code of military justice, including “conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman” for his “inappropriate relationships” with all five women. As a result, Finerty was demoted to brigadier general. He retired from the Air Force in November.\n\nAround the time Finerty was heading the legislative affairs office, from April 2019 to March 2023, Ernst publicly pushed for more money and championed projects for the Air Force on multiple occasions, including in at least one instance on a specific matter that Finerty was advocating for on the Hill.\n\nIn June 2021, she pushed for more Air Force funding from the Senate floor: “While the Biden budget promises a bureaucratic buildup at the IRS, his proposal is far less generous to our armed forces. The Air Force would suffer a substantial cut in its number of aircraft.”\n\nIn April 2022, she attacked then-President Joe Biden for a proposed budget that “shrinks the size of our Air Force.”\n\n“With Putin and his cronies invading Ukraine, China testing hypersonic missiles and threatening Taiwan, Iran enriching uranium, and the Taliban back in control of Afghanistan, it’s as critical as ever that we provide for a strong national defense,” Ernst said in a statement.\n\nTwo months later, she pushed legislation to improve the Pentagon’s access to critical minerals, warning “the Air Force’s premier fighter jet, the F-22, is made with layers of titanium alloy, much of which is sourced from Russia and China.”\n\nIn November 2023, several months after Finerty left his post, she introduced a bill to allow the Pentagon to connect weapons and technology across the various branches of the government, a concept known as Joint All Domain Command and Control — which was on the list of top priorities he texted to one of the women on the Hill he was romantically involved with.\n\nAccording to three sources, Ernst had an earlier romantic relationship around 2019 with an official from the Navy’s legislative affairs office. Ernst was on the armed services committee then as well. One source with knowledge of the situation said the relationship’s end created tension between Ernst’s office and the Navy legislative affairs office. Two sources said the Navy liaison was moved out of his post early. One of them said he was forced to depart his post earlier than expected because he had another romantic relationship with a Hill staffer and that Ernst was not cited by his boss when he was transferred. But the second source said senior officials were aware of the relationship with Ernst and that it played a role.\n\nA Navy spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nErnst has once before been accused of being involved in a relationship that may have violated military rules. In a highly contentious divorce in 2019, her ex-husband alleged she admitted to an affair with one of her soldiers when she served as a company commander during the Iraq War. Ernst denied having an affair.\n\nOther elected officials have drawn scrutiny for their relationships with lobbyists and others who advocate for their employers before Congress.\n\nFormer Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt married a lobbyist for tobacco giant Altria Group, but he pledged to recuse himself from any matters affecting the company. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Bill Shuster was criticized for dating an airline lobbyist while he chaired the House’s transportation committee, a relationship he said was proper because she was not lobbying his office. In 2018, the married state Senate majority leader in Iowa, which Ernst represents, resigned abruptly after video surfaced of him kissing a lobbyist for the Iowa League of Cities.\n\nVirginia Canter, a former government ethics lawyer who served in administrations of both parties, said of the relationships with officials advocating before Ernst’s committee: “It kind of takes your breath away.”\n\nThe relationships, Canter said, make Ernst vulnerable to being extorted if people learned of them and could give someone undue influence over her.\n\n“It draws into question every position she’s taken that would affect his office,” Canter said. “You’re expecting her to represent her constituents’ interests every time she supports a policy or votes. Once she has engaged in that kind of relationship, you have to call into question her impartiality.”\n\nThe military is particularly strict about romantic relationships, with rules against adultery, liaisons between employees of different rank, and various other types of relationships that could create ethical pitfalls.\n\nOne former high-ranking Pentagon official said he thought some of the rules may be antiquated and overly strict, but that a relationship between an officer handling legislative affairs and a senator created too severe a conflict.\n\n“That seems way beyond inappropriate to me, somebody who’s there representing the U.S. military within the military chain of command with a U.S. senator on Armed Services, that makes it really bad.”\n\nJustin Elliott and Andy Kroll contributed reporting.

It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history.\"\n\nWiles is the daughter of former pro football player and NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRacist texts about plantations, KKK reported nationwide after and before election: Reports\n\nMultiple people in different states have reported receiving racially motivated texts a day before or after the 2024 election, with messages ranging from threats of the Ku Klux Klan to directives to \"pick cotton at the nearest plantation,\" according to multiple reports and local law enforcement officials.\n\nResidents in at least Georgia, Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina spoke to local newspapers or TV stations about the anonymous text messages they received either before or after Election Day. A woman, who Fox 2 in Detroit identified as Renee, shared the text message she received around 9:50 p.m. on Wednesday with the TV station.\n\n\"Good afternoon Renee! You have been chosen to pick cotton at your nearest plantation,\" the text message read, per Fox 2. \"Be ready at 10am with all of your personal items & possessions because you will never see them again. We will pick you up in a white bus. You will be checked for drugs & other substances! Once you make it here you will be brought to your designed area. You are in group 10B\".\n\nUSA TODAY contacted the FBI about the text messages on Thursday but did not immediately receive a response.\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse\n\nRepublican Dave McCormick ousts incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania Senate race\n\nGOP businessman Dave McCormick has ousted Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, toppling a three-term incumbent he’d relentlessly attacked as ineffectual and weak.\n\nHe prevailed by chipping away at his opponent's significant advantages as someone who has campaigned across the commonwealth for decades and whose name has been prominent in Pennsylvania politics for generations.\n\nThe race drew national attention for its potential to flip a seat from blue to red in the Senate, where Democrats have enjoyed a slim majority.\n\n– Bethany Rodgers\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell says he won’t resign if Trump asks him to step down\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday he won’t step down if Donald Trump asks him to resign.\n\n“No,” Powell said when posed that question at his first press conference since Trump’s victory this week over Kamala Harris.\n\nPressed whether he believes he would be legally obligated to step down, Powell responded, “No.” He later clarified that he believes that he would not be obligated to leave under federal law.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell to his first four-year term in 2017, has regularly criticized Powell’s performance as the head of the nation’s central banking system, with the power to lower and raise interest rates. The Fed lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point Thursday, its second straight rate cut amid easing inflation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reappointed Powell to a second four-year term in 2021.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump pledges to follow through on mass deportations – and doesn't say what it might cost\n\nDonald Trump in an interview with NBC News pledged to follow though with mass deportations of migrants who crossed the border illegally – and denied concerns about the cost of his plan.\n\n\"It’s not a question of a price tag ... we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC, claiming that too many criminals and drug lords are in the country illegally. The president-elect has not elaborated on the details of how such a massive undertaking might work.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance has estimated Trump's actions could result in 1 million people being removed from the country each year, a pace the nonpartisan American Immigration Council estimated would cost about $88 billion annually. To deport all the people in the U.S. without authorization would take about a decade and cost nearly a trillion dollars, the council said.\n\nIn his chat with NBC, Trump said immigration played a major role in his election win. Trump also confirmed that he had \"nice\" and \"very respectful\" calls with Harris and Biden.\n\nHarris \"talked about (the) transition, and she said she’d like it to be smooth as can be,\" Trump said. \"Which I agree with, of course.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden stands by late departure from 2024 race, White House says\n\nJoe Biden stands by his decision to drop out of the race and the timing of his departure, the White House said Thursday, amid criticism from some Democrats that he should have done so earlier.\n\n“He was very proud of when he made that decision to hand over the torch, pass the torch to the vice president,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “He believed it was the right decision to make at that time. He believed that she was ready.”\n\nSome Democrats have criticized Biden for waiting until July 21 before to drop out of the election. Exiting a year earlier would have allowed for an open competitive primary for Democrats to field a nominee.\n\nAsked whether Biden believes he would won had he stayed in the race, Jean-Pierre reiterated the president believes he “made the right decision.”\n\nJean-Pierre would not not say whether Biden accepts any blame for Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to Trump.\n\n“He’s going to respect the will of the people,” she said.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House blames ‘global headwinds’ after Harris election loss\n\nThe White House blamed “global headwinds” facing incumbent political leaders worldwide as an underlying factor in Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed Thursday to global supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled an increase in inflation in the United States and around the world over the last couple years.\n\n\"What we saw two nights ago was not unusual to what we have seen from the incumbents around the world on the global stage,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak lost reelection this year, French President Emmanuel Macron suffered parliamentary losses, and the parties of prime ministers of Japan and South Korea lost majorities in their respective legislative bodies, among several other setbacks for incumbents.\n\nBiden committed to a peaceful transfer of power in a Rose Garden speech Thursday but has not addressed reporters following Trump’s resounding election victory, which saw Biden’s party lose considerable support among Latino men and working-class voters.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of postmortem analysis of what happened in the coming days, in the coming weeks, even in the coming months,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And so, I'm going to leave those questions to the election experts. That is certainly not my role today.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump to donors: What should I do on day one?\n\nThe Trump campaign has sent a new text message to donors, but it is asking for advice rather than money.\n\n\"I have one more question to ask you before I take back the White House,\" Trump said in the message. \"WHAT SHOULD BE MY PRIORITY ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY?\"\n\nCheckoff options include: \"Build The Wall,\" \"Stop Skyrocketing Crime,\" \"Save The Economy,\" \"Fix Health Care,\" \"Protection The Second Amendment,\" and \"Other.\" During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to be a \"dictator\" on day one when it came to border security and energy production.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping election victory likely signals the undoing of much of President Joe Biden’s efforts to reform higher education in the U.S.\n\nIn his years at the helm of the federal government, Biden approved billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness, cracked down on colleges that rip students off and worked to codify new protections for LGBTQ+ students. Those efforts – some of which sparked controversies and brought setbacks – are among the key Democratic priorities that Trump's win threatens.\n\nThe rhetoric of the former president on the campaign trail, and his actions while in office, offer ample evidence of his goals. He spent much of his first term dismantling higher education regulations set by former President Barack Obama, who was unusually hawkish on the issue of college oversight.\n\nTuesday's election results shined a spotlight on the partisan divide between Americans with college degrees and those without them.\n\nThough it’s unclear what the president-elect will accomplish with another four years in the White House, he will likely capitalize on that mandate from noncollege-educated voters to chart a far different path from Biden for America’s universities, and, by extension, for the millions of people who attend college in hopes of securing the best future for themselves and their families.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nLGBTQ+ hotlines experience influx in crisis calls amid 2024 presidential election\n\nCrisis services for the LGBTQ+ community have seen a sharp uptick in usage during election week, according to a national LGBTQ+ organization.\n\nSince around midnight on Tuesday, The Trevor Project's classic crisis services, which include a lifeline, chat and text, have experienced an approximately 125% increase in contact compared to normal days, The Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThis influx follows a 200% increase in election-related conversations to The Trevor Project's classic crisis services reported Nov. 3-4. Key words like \"election\" and \"rights\" were used to determine this figure, according to a news release.\n\nIncreased rates of outreach to The Trevor Project come after the LGBTQ+ community was commonly thrust into discourse on the presidential campaign trail and as the community feels anxious about future legislation.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nBiden congratulates Trump, pledges smooth transition\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged his administration's full support Thursday for a smooth transition of power, two days after Vice President Kamala Harris's run to replace him was ended by Trump's triumph.\n\n\"In a democracy the will of the people always prevails,\" said Biden, addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden. \"Yesterday I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory. And I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve.\"\n\nBiden's unifying tone was a sharp contrast to Trump's furious response to defeat four years ago, when Trump alleged baseless claims of fraud in an unrelenting but ultimately failed effort to overturn Biden's victory.\n\nBiden also lauded Harris, saying his \"partner and public servant\" ran an inspiring campaign. Harris, who conceded a day earlier, had claimed the Democratic nomination after Biden dropped out of the race in July amid concerns about his mental acuity.\n\n\"Setbacks are unavoidable but giving up is unforgiveable. We all get knocked down,\" Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\n\nAlso Thursday, Trump's campaign said Biden had invited him to meet at the White House at an unspecified time. The White House said last week that Biden would attend his successor’s inauguration in January regardless of who that successor was.\n\nAll quiet on the Trump front\n\nLittle has been heard from Trump, who hasn't even posted on Truth Social since his victory speech early Wednesday. Trump is reportedly spending a lot of time on the phone, including calls with world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAnother probable reason for the silence: Team Trump is moving from a political campaign to a government transition. During the campaign, Trump said he didn't want to talk about the transition because it would be bad luck to do so before Election Day. Now the transition talk is likely dominating his time.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTop House Democrat congratulates Trump on victory\n\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., released a statement Thursday congratulating Trump on his victory.\n\n“I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial. Our Democracy is precious and it involves elevating public trust in our system of free and fair elections, not undermining it,” Jeffries wrote. “We cannot love America only when we win. The American people have spoken. I congratulate President-elect Donald J. Trump.”\n\nHe added that Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are “remarkable public servants who ran an inspired and positive campaign focused on lifting people up.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDefense Secretary Austin says military will stay out of politics\n\nThe Pentagon is committed to an orderly transition to a Trump administration and is ready to carry out \"all lawful orders,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. Austin is a Biden appointee whose stint as secretary will end after Trump selects and wins Senate approval for a new secretary.\n\nTrump, during his campaign, talked about facing an \"enemy from within,\" specifying some Democratic leaders.\n\nAustin, in a memo to U.S. troops sent out on Wednesday night and publicly released Thursday, pledged that the military was ready to \"stand apart from the political arena; to stand guard over our republic with principle and professionalism; and to stand together with the valued allies and partners who deepen our security.\"\n\nWhat role will JD Vance play in the Trump administration?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump hasn't talked much about how his second administration will operate, but Vice President-elect JD Vance appears to have at least two roles locked up: cheerleader and communicator.\n\n\"He is a feisty guy, isn’t he?\" Trump said of his 40-year-old running mate during his victory speech Wednesday.\n\nAfter securing the vice presidential nomination, Vance happily played the role of Trump's attack dog as he barnstormed the 2024 swing states. He maintained an antagonistic presence on social media and called Harris \"trash\" − a nod to President Joe Biden's \"garbage\" gaffe. The freshman Ohio senator also gave more media interviews than anyone at the top of the ticket − 152, according to his campaign − and turned press conferences into part of the show at his rallies.\n\n\"I know the president wants me to be involved in everything, and I certainly hope to be,\" he told USA TODAY in September.\n\n− David Jackson and Haley BeMiller\n\nWhat kind of VP will Vance be?

Bernie Sanders is blaming the Democratic Party after Harris lost to Trump and Republicans gained control of the Senate. In a statement shared on social media, the U.S. senator from Vermont said party leadership must have \"serious political discussions\" about Latino and Black workers voting for Republican candidates.\n\n\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\" Sanders wrote. \"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they’re right.\"\n\nSanders, 83, who runs as an independent but routinely aligns with Democrats, won a fourth Senate term on Election Day, defeating Republican challenger Gerald Malloy.

Adam Schiff as a defender of democracy; Rep. Katie Porter as an anti-corruption crusader; Rep. Barbara Lee as a courageous progressive; Eric Early as a champion for the “forgotten Americans;” and Steve Garvey as a commonsense consensus builder.\n\nBut their ads, slogans and speeches offer only a glimpse into who they are, or what they have done — or plan to do — to tackle some of Californians’ most pressing concerns. All three Democrats have years of voting records while serving in Congress.\n\nAll but Early are set to debate for the first time in this race on Monday evening. Ahead of the event, CalMatters sent each campaign a questionnaire and analyzed their records and stances on issues such as border, immigration, criminal justice, foreign policy, economy, labor and housing.\n\nHere’s a detailed look at where they stand on those issues — and how they differ from each other:\n\nBorder and immigration\n\nThe three Democrats share a similar track record on immigration and border security issues.\n\nThey all voted against Republican proposals to bar federally-funded housing to migrants, limit asylum eligibility and condemn the use of public school facilities to shelter migrants. They have all supported — or even co-sponsored — bills to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and their children, establish independent oversight on border security activities and limit the president’s ability to restrict undocumented immigrant entries.\n\nAll support expanding unemployment insurance benefits to undocumented immigrants seeking work.\n\nAt a November immigration forum, all three Democrats criticized President Joe Biden’s policy that banned most migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border illegally. Porter said the policy was “dishonoring this nation’s history and our future.” Schiff and Lee both called it “wrong.”\n\nBiden — noting that previous congressional actions tied his hands — decided to continue building former President Donald Trump’s Mexican border wall in October, shocking some Democrats. The decision drew instant criticism from Lee, who urged White House to reverse course in a tweet.\n\nLee, Schiff and Porter all agreed a generic border wall is ineffective in response to CalMatters’ questionnaire this month. Schiff and Porter both advocated for increased use of detection technologies at the border.\n\nPorter, however, said some “site-specific” barriers do work, “for example, in dangerous areas where the lives of migrants and U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel are at risk when there are unauthorized crossings and search and rescue missions.”\n\nOf the three Democrats, Lee appears to be the most staunch critic of allocating more funds to federal border patrol agencies.\n\nIn 2019, Lee voted against authorizing a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid and security funding package at the southern border, while Schiff and Porter voted in favor. The package — backed by Republicans and moderate Democrats — passed the House without the stronger protections in migrant facilities that House progressives had supported.\n\nLee called for a 50% budget cut for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in statements to CalMatters. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security, she said, would be better spent on “meaningful immigration reform.”\n\n“ICE is rotten to the core,” Lee said in response to the CalMatters questionnaire. She is the only Senate candidate to have voted against creating the agency in 2002, when Schiff — then in his first term — supported it.\n\nPorter told CalMatters she generally does not support additional funding for the agency, but said she wants border patrol employees to “receive pay commensurate with their work” to help “recruit a workforce that can meet the needs of our border communities.”\n\nSchiff said Congress should provide aid to border communities and increase resources and personnel at ports of entry to help handle an influx of asylum seekers.\n\nThe top two Republicans — Garvey and Early — both support the border wall, additional funding for border patrol agents and tightened restrictions on border entries. Both said the nation should prioritize immigration applications from people legally present in the United States and both oppose offering undocumented immigrants unemployment benefits.\n\nEarly argued he supports a path to citizenship for “illegal immigrants who have enlisted in and participated honorably in our military.” Currently, non-citizens can only join the military if they are legal permanent residents, but a Democrats-backed bill in Congress would allow undocumented DREAMers to serve in the military.\n\nGarvey visited the Mexico border as one of his first campaign events last month and said he wants to complete the wall.\n\nCrime and guns\n\nOn this topic, the Republican and Democratic candidates seem to share some common ground.\n\nThey have all stressed the need to invest in mental health services as well as policing to address crime, but the devil’s in the details.\n\nThe three Democrats want more funding to reform policing methods. They all voted for de-escalation training for police, more federal dollars for violence intervention initiatives and restricting police use of chokeholds after George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nGarvey and Early’s campaigns called for more funding for police departments and law enforcement officers, as well as the need to secure the southern border.\n\nAll three Democrats support boosting funding for mental health treatment programs. Lee — arguing poverty is the root cause of crime — believes raising the minimum wage, expanding access to healthcare and legalizing marijuana will address the “structural problems” that lead to criminal acts, her campaign says.\n\nPorter’s campaign championed her Mental Health Justice Act — a 2022 bill to give grants to governments to recruit and train mental health professionals to respond to emergency calls. Schiff and Lee both voted for the measure.\n\nGarvey’s campaign said he also supports funding to treat mental health problems and drug addiction, arguing they often contribute to gun violence and homelessness. Early, via a campaign spokesperson, advocated for a “rebuild” of the nation’s mental health system “that allows for the severely mentally ill to be permanently housed and cared for,” arguing that services were “decimated” in the 1960s — when people were discharged from institutions and placed in community-based care centers amid the civil rights movement.\n\nOn gun policies, Garvey supports “common-sense measures” such as pre-sale background checks and an assault weapon ban — something mainly supported by Democrats, according to his campaign. “We can keep guns out of the hands of criminals while also protecting Second Amendment rights,” his campaign said in a response to CalMatters’ questions.\n\nThe candidates are otherwise split along party lines. For example, all three Democrats oppose the federal death penalty, while Republicans argue the opposite.\n\nBut there are nuanced differences, especially among Democrats. They all voted against legislation to permanently raise fentanyl-related drugs to the highest class of illegal substances — a GOP-led bill Biden urged Congress to pass. Lee, however, was the only candidate to vote against even temporarily doing so.\n\nSchiff — a former prosecutor in Los Angeles — has the most controversial track record on criminal justice issues due to his past support for tough-on-crime policies.\n\nSchiff was among 48 Democrats to support the Thin Blue Line Act in 2017 to apply the federal death penalty to cop killers — something Early supports. Schiff has since publicly spoken against the sentence. In his campaign response to CalMatters, Schiff credited his change of heart to “technological advancements” that revealed “deep flaws” with the death penalty and a “disproportionate application” of the sentence on people of color.\n\nAs a state senator, Schiff authored legislation to crack down on juveniles, including a bill to create year-long “boot camps” for teenagers found in possession of marijuana at school and another to try kids 14 years and older as adults if they commit murder or rape.\n\nIn Congress, he introduced legislation in 2009 to increase funding to a controversial program to place more cops in communities, supported language to exclude asylum seekers and immigrants from privacy protections and voted for the Protect and Serve Act in 2018 to impose stricter penalties on assaulting law enforcement officers, which most Democrats voted for. Lee voted against both measures.\n\nSchiff’s record irked criminal justice activists, who in a 2021 letter urged Gov. Gavin Newsom not to appoint Schiff as the next state attorney general. He has since softened some of his positions on criminal justice. In February 2023, he said his viewpoint had changed since the 1990s. “I’ve learned that some of the policies of the 90s didn’t work,” he told ABC7 last year.\n\nForeign policy and defense\n\nThe issue of a ceasefire in the Gaza war highlights a key split among the three Democratic hopefuls.\n\nA day after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Lee called for a permanent ceasefire from the stage of a Senate candidate debate — one of the first members of Congress to do so. Schiff called for “unequivocal support” for Israel, while Porter cautioned against Islamophobia and mourned the lives lost on both sides.\n\nFor months afterward, as the casualty numbers rose in Gaza, Schiff and Porter both called for a “humanitarian pause” — aligning with the Biden administration’s policy. But as calls for a permanent ceasefire grew, Porter shifted her stance in a Dec. 18 statement, calling for a “lasting bilateral ceasefire” that “brings remaining hostages home, secures Israel’s safety, removes Hamas from operational control of Gaza, and invests in creating a better economic and political architecture for Palestinians in Gaza.”\n\nWhen asked to explain why she shifted her stance, Porter’s campaign pointed to her Dec. 18 statement, in which she seemed to suggest Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of Palestinian governance of Gaza was the reason.\n\n“His remarks and actions necessitate tough conversations with our ally Israel about its long-term strategy and among U.S. policymakers about our approach in the Middle East,” she said in the statement.\n\nSchiff, however, has stood by his initial position, arguing that a permanent ceasefire would “perpetuate Hamas terrorist control of Gaza,” according to his campaign.\n\nAll three Democrats signed on as co-sponsors of a largely symbolic bipartisan House resolution affirming Israel’s right to defend itself. But Lee was the only candidate to vote against the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act — a bipartisan bill that would sanction Hamas, its affiliates and governments providing aid to the group.\n\n“The bill was opposed by major humanitarian organizations because it is overly broad and will hurt a lot of innocent Palestinians by making it harder if not impossible to receive humanitarian assistance,” Lee spokesperson Sean Ryan told CalMatters in an email.\n\nDecades before Gaza, Lee shocked the world by being the lone vote against the Afghanistan war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a decision that got her death threats then but now hailed as a show of courage by her supporters.\n\nLee is still somewhat of a unicorn on foreign policy compared to her opponents.\n\nIn 2002, Lee voted against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, while Schiff voted in favor. Lee has since sponsored a resolution to repeal the authorization most years; it wasn’t until 2021 that the House passed it, with Schiff and Porter both voting in favor.\n\nLee was also the only candidate to support a U.S. troop removal from Syria in March 2023 — a measure most Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, voted against. Critics of the bill said a removal could give Islamic State terrorists time to reorganize, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAdditionally, Lee touts herself as the most consistent in calling for cutting the nation’s “bloated” defense budget. She has voted against authorizing defense and military spending when Schiff and Porter voted in favor, voting records show.\n\nSchiff’s campaign said he wants to reduce the Pentagon’s budget by 10% and supports eliminating weapons systems the administration does not need or want. “There is far too much waste in the defense budget that must be eliminated,” his campaign said.\n\nPorter’s campaign said the funding level needs to be indexed to national security threats and there needs to be more oversight. “I’ll never rubber stamp spending, but I believe investing in our servicemembers and their well-being is paramount,” the campaign said.\n\nBoth Republicans support increasing the defense budget. Neither Garvey nor Early supported a call for a ceasefire. They both argued Israel must have the ability to fight Hamas until it is destroyed, their campaigns said.\n\nEconomy and labor\n\nAlthough far lower than during the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation remains high, jumping from 3.1% to 3.4% in December. Experts attribute it to the rising cost of housing, and project it’s unlikely to last given a housing market cool-down, NBC reported.\n\nRepublican candidates blame the Biden administration. Garvey attributed it to “excessive government spending” while Early criticized the reduction of domestic energy production — a GOP talking point that conflicts with record-high U.S. oil production in October.\n\nDemocrats slam corporations instead. Porter — a self-proclaimed warrior taking on Wall Street interests — argued inflation worsened because businesses are overcharging customers, pointing to record-high profits for big corporations. Similarly, Lee blamed corporate greed. Apart from corporate profit, Schiff pointed to the supply chain interruption during the pandemic and a lack of housing as contributing factors.\n\nAmong the three Democrats, Schiff — a past member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition — has historically been the most skeptical of federal spending. In 2005, he demanded a “rainy-day” reserve in the budget.\n\nSchiff is the only Senate candidate to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling last year to avoid a default. Lee and Porter — along with 38 other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — voted against it. Lee said she voted to stand up against “extreme MAGA Republicans holding our economy hostage,” and Porter — who has argued the debt ceiling should be abolished — criticized the measure for including “giveaways” to the oil and gas industry, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nSchiff, who applied to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus last year but withdrew, voted multiple times against the “People’s Budget” — which contains all the caucus’ priorities and which has served as a purity test. Lee — the only other candidate in Congress at the time — voted in favor.\n\nLee is also the only candidate to sponsor the Curtail Executive Overcompensation Act, a measure increasing taxes on corporate CEOs. Lee and Porter are both sponsoring the Oligarch Act, another measure aimed to tax the rich, while Schiff is not. Schiff has, however, expressed support for repealing tax cuts for the wealthy made under the Trump administration.\n\nAll three Democrats have gained union endorsements, although Schiff has won the most from statewide unions. All the Democrats support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act to override all state right-to-work laws and strengthen union protections. Garvey and Early both said that the decision belongs to states, not the federal government, according to their campaigns.\n\nThe five candidates also split along party lines on whether striking workers should be eligible for unemployment benefits — a controversial bill vetoed by Gov. Newsom last year. All three Democrats said those workers deserve the benefits. Early outright said no, while Garvey’s campaign told CalMatters that governments should stay out of disputes between unions and businesses.\n\nAll three Democrats believe the federal minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — should increase.\n\nLee called for a $50 hourly minimum wage during a forum last year, noting that’s the living wage one working adult with two children would have to make, according to an Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate.\n\nPorter’s campaign said she supports a $20 federal minimum wage and $25 for California, indexed to inflation. Schiff’s campaign said he supports a $20 federal minimum wage indexed to inflation, with a boost to $25 for health care workers.\n\nEarly believes the federal rate does not need to change and that an increase would worsen inflation, according to his campaign.\n\nGarvey, on the other hand, did not give a specific number. “Each state and its voters have the ability to raise their minimum wage, as California has multiple times, beyond the federal minimum wage,” his campaign said.\n\nHomelessness and housing\n\nOn California’s worsening homelessness crisis, Republican candidates say mental health problems are the main culprit — not the lack of affordable housing.\n\nEarly, in his campaign’s response to CalMatters’ questions, said the cause of the state’s homelessness is “severe mental illness” and “soft-on-crime” policies, referring to Proposition 47 — a ballot measure passed in 2014 that reduced penalties for certain thefts and drug offenses.\n\n“The biggest factor is manifestly not insufficient low-income housing,” the campaign’s statement read.\n\nGarvey’s campaign said the biggest driving factors of the problem are “drug and alcohol addiction” and “mental health issues.” During a Wednesday visit to a Sacramento homeless encampment, he said he wants a “deep dive” into how taxpayer dollars are spent to battle the homelessness crisis.\n\nBut the Democratic candidates all argued a lack of affordable housing is driving the crisis.\n\nThe homelessness problem is a “direct result” of failed federal housing policies over the past decades, Porter argues on her website. Her campaign said she supports a “major investment” in housing, including a fully-funded federal Section 8 program and an expansion of the national Low Income Housing Tax Credit.\n\nLee’s campaign said homelessness is a housing issue “at its core.” Like Porter, she also called for a fully-funded Section 8 program and a national rent control standard — one that the Biden administration has pushed for. She believes expanding health care access, offering free college and raising the minimum wage would help ease homelessness in the state, her campaign said. She also touted legislation she introduced to help renters, such as the DEPOSIT Act, which would allow federal programs to cover security deposit and moving expenses for those using the Housing Choice vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, Schiff’s campaign said he also supports expanding Section 8 vouchers and providing wraparound services. Additionally, his campaign stressed the importance of easing regulations and offering tax incentives to encourage the build-out of affordable housing — something Garvey and Early also support.\n\nOn Schiff’s campaign website, he touted legislation he introduced and supported to fight homelessness, including the Affordable and Homeless Housing Incentive Act, which would offer tax incentives for homeless shelters.\n\nAsked if they support more federal funding to combat the crisis, only Early’s campaign said no. Garvey’s campaign said funding for housing should prioritize projects in “low-income areas, and near job and transit centers.”\n\nSchiff and Lee have both touted their success securing earmarked funds for housing and homelessness. Porter, however, is a staunch opponent of earmark requests, arguing the funding goes to lawmakers’ “pet projects” and requests should be rejected. She has signed onto letters instead, urging her colleagues to approve grants to homelessness assistance programs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/28/trump-immigration-panama-canal-live/77991621007/", "title": "Spending pause, employee buyout, top Tuesday political agenda ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's priorities topped the political agenda from New York to Florida on Tuesday, from immigration raids to lawmakers meeting about how to pass his legislative goals.\n\nTrump issued an order blocking federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The Trump administration was sued over its Monday night memo ordering federal agencies to stop disbursing grants and loans and a federal judge temporarily stopped Trump's move from taking effect. And Trump offered a buyout to federal employees who don't want to return to the office.\n\nAt a hearing in response to Trump's threats to \"take back\" the Panama Canal, maritime experts said the canal was firmly under the operational control of the Panama Canal Authority, contrary to Trump's claim it is under Chinese control. But experts still pushed for the U.S. to make its maritime strategy a \"national priority\" to counter China's growing economic dominance.\n\nKristi Noem, who was confirmed Saturday as secretary of Homeland Security, was in New York City on Tuesday as members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested immigrants in the country without legal authorization who have been convicted of crimes.\n\nHouse Republicans continued to meet Tuesday in Florida to iron out differences over Trump's goals for cutting taxes and spending. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was scheduled to give a speech at 8 a.m., but it was postponed. Vice President J.D. Vance is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m.\n\nBack in Washington, the Senate confirmed former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy to lead the Transportation Department.\n\nSlate of controversial nominees come before the Senate this week\n\nDays after senators narrowly confirmed Trump’s embattled Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, a marathon of confirmation hearings featuring other high-profile – and some equally controversial – Cabinet picks begins Wednesday.\n\nAmong the headliners is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is up for secretary of Health and Human Services. A 2024 presidential candidate turned ally to Trump, Kennedy is expected to face tough questions Wednesday and Thursday from not one but two Senate committees curious about his stances on issues ranging from abortion to vaccinations.\n\n“I don’t have a sense of how that hearing’s going to go,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told USA TODAY. Hawley sits on the committee overseeing Kennedy’s Thursday hearing, his second of the week.\n\n“There’s such a wide range of topics there, I’ll be curious to see what tomorrow’s hearing yields, and then I imagine the Thursday hearing will pick up from there,” Hawley continued.\n\nAlso on the docket this week is FBI director nominee Kash Patel and director of national intelligence pick Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard’s confirmation is in question, given doubts by a handful of Senate Republicans regarding her experience and past statements appearing sympathetic to foreign dictators, including Vladmir Putin of Russia.\n\n“They’re going to be controversial,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said of Gabbard and Kennedy.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nAt Panama Canal hearing, warnings and fears of growing Chinese power\n\nAt a hearing in response to President Donald Trump's threats to \"take back\" the Panama Canal on Tuesday, senators outlined a hypothetical scenario in which China, in a conflict with the U.S., could block off the canal in order to cut off U.S. trade. Senators on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee raised concern about ports on both ends of the canal owned by Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based company that they said was subject to Chinese influence.\n\nMaritime experts said the canal was firmly under the operational control of the Panama Canal Authority - Trump had falsely claimed it was under Chinese control. But experts still pushed for the U.S. to make its maritime strategy a \"national priority\" to counter China's growing economic dominance.\n\nInvesting in international trade \"does not make a very good campaign ad, but it may be necessary,\" given China's \"aggressive and frankly, on this, open strategy that China has had,\" Daniel Maffei, a Federal Maritime commissioner, said.\n\n\"China is definitely beating us\" with its Belt and Road initiative, a massive economic development and international trade strategy launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013, said Louis Sola, the commission's chairman.\n\n−Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhite House: federal grant pause won’t affect Social Security, Medicare\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pause wouldn’t cover Social Security and Medicare benefits or food stamps – assistance that is going directly to individuals.\n\n“This is not a blanket pause on federal assistance and grant programs from the Trump administration,” Leavitt said. “However, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nShe said the goal is to block funding for programs that he opposes such as Diversity, Equality and Inclusion in hiring and the Green New Deal for climate policy. Officials found $37 million about to be sent to the World Health Organization, which Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from, and $50 million for condoms in Gaza, which Leavitt called “a preposterous waste of government money.”\n\n“President Trump is looking out for you in issuing his pause,” she said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nSean Duffy confirmed as Transportation secretary\n\nThe Senate confirmed Sean Duffy on Tuesday as secretary of Transportation, clearing the way for another of President Donald Trump's Cabinet officials to start working on plans to improve traffic safety, cut regulations on construction projects and restore public confidence in Boeing.\n\nDuffy was confirmed by a vote of 77 to 22.\n\nIn nominating Duffy to his post, Trump said the former Wisconsin Republican lawmaker would use his experience and relationships from eight years in Congress to rebuild the country’s infrastructure and improve travel safety.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nPritzker slams pause on loans and grants\n\nState agencies in Illinois have been reporting issues with accessing federal funding sites, including the site that issues federal payments to Medicaid, according to a statement by Alex Gough, the press secretary for Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat.\n\n“The US Constitution does not grant the President this unilateral authority,” Pritzker said in a statement.” In Illinois, we will stand against unlawful actions that would harm millions of working families, children, and seniors.”\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nAdvocacy groups ask federal court to block Trump federal grant memo\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups for nonprofits, health care and small businesses asked a federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration’s memo pausing federal grants and loans.\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health Association and the Main Street Alliance asked for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, to prevent the pause scheduled for 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n“This reckless action by the administration would be catastrophic for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,” said Diane Yentel, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. “From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to halting housing and food assistance, shuttering domestic violence and homeless shelters, and closing suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives.\"\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nFormer OMB official calls new OMB directive “cruel” and “a massive fraud”\n\nTopher Spiro, a former associate director at OMB, called the OMB memo “a massive fraud,” and said he has “no doubt that OMB lawyers would believe this is illegal.”\n\n“I know (acting OMB Director) Matt Vaeth. This memo reads like a hostage note written directly by Russ Vought, who is not confirmed,” Spiro said in a series of posts on the social media platform @X.\n\nSpiro said Vought, the incoming OMB director and Project 2025 chief architect, “is illegally carrying out his ideological agenda with greatest harm to the most vulnerable--including many in the working class and rural communities who voted for Trump.”\n\nA sampling of funding potentially affected in health care, Spiro said, includes all opioid prevention funding, all mental health funding, funding for community health centers, suicide prevention and the suicide lifeline, HIV/AIDS treatment and grants to states to address avian flu.\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nSenate Budget Committee plans Vought vote despite Democratic complaints\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee issued a statement Tuesday saying lawmakers will vote Thursday as scheduled on Russell Vought’s nomination to become director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDemocrats complained the Trump administration was trying to usurp the power of Congress by temporarily freezing billions in federal grants and loans. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, proposed a two-week postponement of the Vought vote to learn more about the freeze that sparked chaos among federal grand recipients.\n\nBut the committee headed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it would hold the vote anyway.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nDemocrats blast Trump over freezing federal grants nationwide\n\nSenate Democrats blasted the Trump administration’s freeze on federal grants set to go into effect Tuesday at 5 p.m. as an unconstitutional power grab that sparked widespread panic about funding drying up overnight.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump shut off billions and perhaps trillions of dollars to state and local governments, schools, hospitals and small businesses – and disaster aid.\n\n“It’s a dagger at the heart of the average American family,” Schumer said. “It is just outrageous.”\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget issued a memo Monday ordering a pause in grant and loan funding while officials review whether the spending priorities are aligned with Trump. The White House said the pause wouldn’t impact Social Security or Medicare payments.\n\nBut Democrats argued the bipartisan spending decisions were made by Congress and can’t be overturned by Trump. Democratic senators called for a two-week postponement of the Senate Budget Committee vote scheduled Thursday on Russell Vought’s nomination to become director of OMB to learn more about the freeze.\n\n“The scope of this illegal action is unprecedented and could have devastating consequences across the country for real people,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. “This memo is creating chaos and confusion about whether these resources will be available to them.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nHouse Republicans meet at Trump's Miami resort\n\nIt may be cold and dreary in Washington, but House Republicans wouldn't know it. They're sitting poolside, hitting the links, and spending hours in conference meetings at the Trump National Doral Miami hotel and golf club.\n\nThe conference is coming together for the second day of their annual policy retreat, where they hope to hammer out more details on their plan to implement President Donald Trump's agenda. They will meet with House GOP leadership and key committee chairs, and hear from Vice President JD Vance at 12:30 p.m.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nGary Peters won’t seek re-election\n\nMichigan's senior senator announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election in 2026, a move that will leave an open seat in the key battleground state during Donald Trump’s first midterm election cycle.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, a Democrat, made the announcement to The Detroit News. He told the news organization he is ready for a new chapter that includes spending time with a new grandchild.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nNoem to speak at DHS after attending New York City arrests\n\nNoem, the former governor of South Dakota, who was confirmed Saturday as the secretary of Homeland Security, will speak to the workforce at 3 p.m.\n\nEarlier in the day, Noem was in New York City as forces from her department began arresting immigrants in the country without legal authorization who have been convicted of crimes. She thanked the “brave officers involved.”\n\n“Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets,” Noem said in a post on X of the arrest of a suspect for kidnapping, assault and burglary.\n\nThe department will be at the forefront of Trump’s top priority of immigration enforcement. The department includes Customs and Border Protection, which is charged with securing the border, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is rounding up migrants without legal authorization to be in the country, for mass deportations.\n\nBut Trump's policy for mass deportations clashes with state and local officials in New York, Illinois and elsewhere that have policies against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n“We are doing this right - doing exactly what President @realDonaldTrump promised the American people – making our streets safe,” Noem said in another post.\n\nSenate hearing to examine trade, security of Panama Canal\n\nThe Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. examining the Panama Canal's impact on U.S. trade and national security.\n\nTrump has criticized previous U.S. policy that turned over control of the canal, a key link for shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, to Panama. Trump has complained about China’s rising influence over the canal.\n\n“Serving forty percent of U.S. seaborne container trade, the Panama Canal is vital to American economic and national security interests,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the committee chairman, said in a statement. “The United States paid for and built the Panama Canal, but Panama is treating America unfairly and ceding control of key infrastructure to China.”\n\nWitnesses include Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission; Daniel Maffei, a member of the commission; Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University; and Joseph Kramek, CEO of the World Shipping Council.\n\nSenate votes at noon on Duffy to lead Transportation\n\nThe Senate scheduled a noon confirmation vote for former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy, Trump’s nominee to lead the Transportation Department.\n\nDuffy’s confirmation is expected because he breezed through his Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing and was approved with a bipartisan vote. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Wis., said Duffy was the right choice for the job.\n\nDuffy has said he would focus on improving safety for roads and aviation, and work to reduce regulations delaying large construction projects.\n\nWhat is Trump doing Tuesday?\n\nTrump has an 11 a.m. intelligence briefing scheduled, but no public events on his agenda after speaking the House Republican Conference in Florida on Monday and signing executive orders to eliminate diversity programs the Pentagon.\n\nGOP lawmakers are meeting to resolve disputes within their party over how to accomplish Trump’s priorities for cutting spending and taxes. If they can reach near unanimity in the closely divided House, Republicans could approve their agenda without Democratic votes.\n\nIn his speech, Trump called the United States a \"meritocracy\" after the elimination of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs in the federal government.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is scheduled to provide her first briefing at 1 p.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2020/01/14/democratic-debate-transcript-what-the-candidates-said-quotes/4460789002/", "title": "Democratic debate: Read the CNN/Des Moines Register debate ...", "text": "Des Moines Register\n\nTHIS IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE DEBATE FROM FDCH. THIS COPY MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nWOLF BLITZER: Live from Drake University in Iowa, this is the CNN Democratic presidential debate, in partnership with the Des Moines Register. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, along with CNN's Abby Phillip and the Des Moines Register's chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n\nABBY PHILLIP: The top six Democratic presidential candidates are in place. This is their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 presidential campaign. The Iowa caucuses are 20 days away.\n\nBRIANNE PFANNENSTIEL: Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.\n\nBLITZER: All right, so let's begin right now. Just this month, the United States and Iran were on the brink of war, which has reignited the debate over America's role in the world and which of you is best prepared to be commander-in-chief. So let's have the debate right now.\n\nSen. Sanders, why are you best prepared — the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, I think my record speaks to that, Wolf. In 2002, when the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against that war.\n\nJust last year, I helped, for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it. We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues.\n\nI am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. Why are you the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n\nJOE BIDEN: I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop what — thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake, and I acknowledged that.\n\nBut right — the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice president. And once we — once we were elected president, he turned — and vice president, he turned to me and asked me to end that war.\n\nI know what it's like to send a son or daughter, like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq, and that's why I do it very, very reluctantly. That's why I led the effort, as you know, Wolf, against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq. And it was a mistaken vote.\n\nBut I think my record overall on everything we've done has been — I'm — I'm prepared to compare it to anybody on this stage.\n\nDebate guide:\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden's vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you both acknowledged mistakes. Why should the American people trust your judgment more?\n\nSANDERS: Well, it's a little bit of a difference. On that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself, voted for it. Only Barbara Lee voted against it.\n\nBut what I understood right away, in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died. We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into health care and education and infrastructure in this country.\n\nJoe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in.\n\nThe world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake. And from that point on, I've voted to — I moved to bring those troops home.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, you've publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg's experience when it comes to being commander-in-chief. Why is your time as a U.S. senator more valuable than his time as a U.S. naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?\n\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Wolf. And I have been very clear that I respect the mayor's experience very much in the military. I just have different experience.\n\nI've been in the U.S. Senate for over 12 years. And I think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life-and-death issues and who has made decisions.\n\nI will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn't in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.\n\nThen I have dealt with every issue, from Afghanistan to keeping our troops with good health care after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with our education and with their jobs and also with their health care.\n\nI think right now what we should be talking about, though, Wolf, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution. We just found out today that four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say: You must have an authorization of military force if you're going to go to war with Iran.\n\nThat is so important, because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I worked on for a significant period of time. As president, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... to protect and defend our Constitution.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And I will mean it.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. We're going to continue talking about who's best prepared to be commander-in-chief. Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9/11, on the war in Iraq. And there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates.\n\nThe next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything we've seen before, not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It's going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past. And for me, those lessons of the past are personal.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, in our new CNN/Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be commander-in-chief?\n\nMore from January's Iowa Poll:\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe the principal job of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. And I think that's about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world.\n\nI've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I've been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops, to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they've been promised, that they don't get cheated by giant financial institutions.\n\nYou know, I have three brothers who were in the military, and I know how much our military families sacrifice. But I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money.\n\nWe have a problem with a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door, and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools — diplomatic, economic, working with our allies — and not let the defense industry call the shots.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander-in-chief?\n\nTOM STEYER: I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with businesses, and I understand how America interacts with other countries.\n\nAnd you asked what is the reason that the — the experience really counts, and to me, I believe that Sen. Warren made a great point. It isn't so much about experience, it's about judgment.\n\nIf you've been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.\n\nAnd if you look who had the judgment, it was a state senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a congresswoman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress.\n\nSo I would say to you this: An outside perspective, looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we're looking for now. I agree with Sen. Warren. We are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we're spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget, and it's time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we're trying to do and how to do it.\n\n►As Tom Steyer's Iowa bus tour ends, some like his outsider resume. Others want more experience.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all U.S. troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you've called for, as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and, indeed, around the world. How would you prevent that from happening again?\n\nSANDERS: O.K., I'm going to tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd that is — and I don't know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not. Maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes were the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. Both of those wars were based on lies. And right now, what I fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.\n\nTo answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working. It was working. It was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd look what's happened. He went ahead — and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happen. We're now isolated. We're in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence.\n\nWe have lost our standing in the region. We have lost the support of our allies. The next president has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances, and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.\n\nBLITZER: So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?\n\nBIDEN: I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we have — where we are now, small numbers of troops, and I think it's a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS.\n\nWhat's happened is, now that he's gone ahead, the president, and started this whole process moving, what's happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We're in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region. And quite frankly, I think he's flat-out lied about saying the reason he went after — the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, what's your response?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home. I would do that. Some would remain for counterterrorism and training.\n\nIn Syria, I would not have removed the 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now, I would leave our troops there, despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.\n\nAt the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also asked them what their alternatives were. And they gave very vague, vague answers.\n\nI asked them, where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was president? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people. Time and time again, you see that this president puts his own interests, his private interests, in front of our country's. I would put our country's interests first as commander-in-chief.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East, or bring them home?\n\nWARREN: No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on Earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take. But we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.\n\nOur keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools.\n\nNow, look, I understand, there are people on this stage, when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about 5 more years, 10 more years. Shoot, Lindsey Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden, is Sen. Warren right?\n\nBIDEN: Well, I tell you what, there's a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition to put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states. Not us alone, 68 other countries.\n\nThat's how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan. Who's right?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what's going on right now is the president's actually sending more. The very president who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along — although we know that's not true — now has more troops going to the Middle East.\n\n►In Iowa, Pete Buttigieg criticizes Joe Biden's 2002 Iraq War vote, calling it the 'worst foreign policy decision' of his lifetime\n\nAnd whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members. I remember walking with a friend of mine, another lieutenant I trained with, as we walked away, and his one-and-a-half-year-old boy was toddling after him, not understanding why his father wasn't turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time.\n\nThat is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm's way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander-in-chief.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Eighty-seven million people have no health care or are uninsured or underinsured. We got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight.\n\nThe American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State Department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.\n\nBLITZER: We're going to get to everyone, but, Vice President Biden, you criticized President Trump's decision to kill the Iranian general, Soleimani, without first going to Congress. Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n\nBIDEN: I ran the first time as a 29-year-old kid against the war in Vietnam on the grounds that the only way to take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people.\n\nAnd with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, including special forces, we — there's no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them. If you don't, we end up being the world's policeman again.\n\nThey're going to come to us. They've come to us before. They'll come to us again. So it's a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries. It's fundamentally the requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. So would the Biden doctrine be different?\n\nBIDEN: No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress, House, and Senate, and signed by the president. That was the authority. It does not give authority to go into Iran. It gave authority to deal with these other issues.\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That authorization needs to be replaced.\n\nBIDEN: Exactly. And we tried to.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: When we lost troops in Niger, there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaida and 9/11. And often, Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now, thanks to Democrats in Congress, that's changing. But the reality is, year after year, Congress didn't want to touch this, either, because it was so politically difficult.\n\nFundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm's way, often on deployment after deployment, then we've got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up-or-down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am president, anytime — which I hope will never happen — but anytime I am compelled to use force and seek that authorization, we will have a three-year sunset, so that the American people are included ...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... not only in the decision about whether to send troops, but whether to continue.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Sen. Warren — we're going to get to everyone — but, Sen. Warren, what about you? Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n\nWARREN: Well, imminent threat. But we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides and that is what as commander-in-chief I will do.\n\nBut I just want to be clear. Everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war. But the question is, when and how do you plan to get out of it?\n\nYou know, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, you know, we've just turned the corner and now it's all going to be different. And then what happens? It's all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we've just turned the corner.\n\nWe've turned the corner so many times, we're going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It's not enough to say some day we're going to get out. No one on the ground, none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It's time to get our combat troops home.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, would a President Steyer use military force as a deterrent? And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?\n\nSTEYER: I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that we're trying to accomplish in what we're doing in the Middle East.\n\nObviously, Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis, from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years, including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that, in fact, there was no strategy. There was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.\n\nSo we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden. To do it, we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that, as we do that, we're confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about.\n\nBut at the same time, there's a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value-driven coalition-building that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we should do should follow into that strategy. And it's just not happening in Washington, D.C.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you'd face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, quote, \"As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\" Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons will, of course, be a priority, because it's such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal.\n\nBy gutting the Iran nuclear deal — one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran — by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.\n\nNow — yes?\n\nPHILLIP: Continue.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: In order to get that done, we've got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA. That first letter \"J\" stood for \"Joint.\" We can't do this alone, even less so now after everything that has happened.\n\nWhich is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world, and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear-armed country.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power, yes or no?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we've got a lot of other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world.\n\nDespite this president's coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We've got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from states, from stateless potential terrorist actors, or anywhere else around the world.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nSen. Klobuchar, if you become president, it's very possible there won't be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would start negotiations again. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.\n\nSo what I would do is negotiate. I would bring people together, just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a president that sees this as a number-one goal.\n\nAnd in answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place. I think there are changes you can make to the agreement that are sunset, some changes to the inspections, but overall, that is what we should do.\n\nAnd I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran, because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n\nBIDEN: No, not now. I wouldn't meet with them without any preconditions. Look, what — we gave him everything he's looking for, legitimacy. The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.\n\nNeed to know ahead of the caucuses:\n\nI would be putting what I did as vice president — I met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make — their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before — and you reported it extensively, Wolf — about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons, that we would — and when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, that's a threat to us, I said, we're going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.\n\nI would reignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea, and I would put enormous pressure, enormous pressure on China, because that's also in their interests for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist.\n\nBut I would not, I would not meet with — absent preconditions, I would not meet with the, quote, \"Supreme Leader,\" who said Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick. I count that ...\n\nSANDERS: Other than that, you like him?\n\nBIDEN: Other than that, I like him, and he — he ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd he got a love letter from Trump right after that.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer, would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n\nSTEYER: No. It's very clear that if we're going to do something with North Korea, we're going to have to do it in concert with our allies, that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get.\n\nBut this is a classic situation where the United States' idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let's face it. Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we've had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran, whereas, in fact, what worked with President Obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That, to me, is called strategy. Having a goal to make America safer, by looking more broadly...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nSTEYER: ... than just us, as the policeman of the world spending money.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Let's stay with the theme of America's role in the world and talk about trade. Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China. And the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa's largest trading partners.\n\n►Iowans applaud deal that clears a path for U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement\n\n►Caught in prolonged trade war, Iowa farmers could finally see a big win with U.S.-China deal\n\nSen. Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, quote, \"makes some modest improvements,\" yet you are going to vote against it. Aren't modest improvements better than no improvements...\n\nSANDERS: No, we can do much ...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in Iowa?\n\nSANDERS: The answer is we could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal. This deal — and I think the proponents of it acknowledge — will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs as a result of outsourcing.\n\nThe heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements — and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China — is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, $1 or $2 an hour.\n\nSecond of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase \"climate change\" in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal. Are you unwilling to compromise?\n\nSANDERS: The AFL-CIO does. The Machinists Union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.\n\nSo I happen to believe — and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment — if we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our children — and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.\n\n►2020 candidates on agriculture: In Iowa, six Democratic presidential candidates vow to help farmers, battered by low prices, trade disputes\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: We're going to get to climate change, but I'd like to stay on trade. Sen. Warren ...\n\nSANDERS: Well, they are the same in this issue.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren, you support the USMCA. Why is Sen. Sanders wrong?\n\nWARREN: I do. I wasn't here. I haven't been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe, because I didn't think it was in the interests of the American people, the American workers, or environmental interests.\n\nBut we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really don't have enforcement on workers' rights.\n\nThis new trade deal is a modest improvement. Sen. Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers. It will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help, and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal.\n\nWe need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just to trade policy written for big, international companies. I'm ready to have that fight, but let's help the people who need help right now.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you. Sen. Sanders, can you please respond to Sen. Warren?\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years.\n\nSen. Warren is right in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that — it is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is, I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations behind doors.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Klobuchar, I'd like to bring you in here.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the Agriculture Committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa — and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are — and I went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump's trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard. That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said, these are my friends, they don't work anymore. And their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador. And that guy started to cry.\n\nThese are real people hurt by Donald Trump's trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA, I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown on labor and environment and on pharma, the sweetheart deal...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... because I think we need a big trading block...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... with North America to take on China. And the way you are stronger...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Klobuchar, your time is up.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... China is with our allies.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, do you support the USMCA, yes or no?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, it has been improved, it is not perfect. But when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA.\n\nBut let's acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. You know, my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the '90s, selling trade deals, telling us, don't worry about your slice of the pie, the pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off. And that promise was broken.\n\nThe part about the pie getting bigger happened. It's just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not. That is why there is such frustration, the sense that these decisions in boardrooms...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what's best for us...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... but based on their own gain.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, Sen. Sanders has said that Donald Trump will, quote, “eat your lunch” for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements. When it comes to trade, why are you the best candidate to take on President Trump?\n\nBIDEN: There will be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalists and labor at the table. And there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing American workers to compete in the 21st Century on the high-tech side, dealing with all artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.\n\nAnd by the way, the idea — I don't know that there's any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95 percent of the customers are out there. So we better figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement here, in case you haven't noticed. And that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone. And that is to increase the profits of large multi-national corporations. And the end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA, cost us some 4 million jobs, as part of the race to the bottom.\n\nI am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else, and then they think they're going to get on line for our generous federal contract, they've got another thing going.\n\nWe need some corporate responsibility here and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam, and all these other countries.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Vice president, what's your response?\n\nBIDEN: We need corporate responsibility and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we make. Enforceable agreements. That's one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico. And that's what we should be doing in any agreement we have.\n\nBut let's get back to the basics here. If we don't set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our eye — excuse me, poking our finger in the eye of all of our friends and allies, we make up 25 percent of the world's economy. We've got to bring the other 25 percent of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things, using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: You know, our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It has been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had this strategy for decades. And that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multi-national corporation lobbyists and corporate executives, who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multi-national corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.\n\nWe need a different approach to trade and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market. And we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you've got to meet some environmental standards. You've got to meet labor standards.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nWARREN: We need a...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: ... approach.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: I would like to bring in Mr. Steyer here.\n\nMr. Steyer, even though farmers and manufacturers here in Iowa and around the country could see some relief from the China deal, they've been crushed by the current administration's trade war. What will you do as president to help them get back on their feet?\n\nSTEYER: Look, on the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump's tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Sen. Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners, so that not having to use corn-based ethanol.\n\nIn fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Sen. Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that they've been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate.\n\nSo let me say this. I'm the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can't sign a deal, even if it's marginally better for working people until climate is also taken into consideration.\n\n►What a difference one degree makes: Iowa is getting hotter, bringing more frequent and intense storms\n\nLook, I've got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31. I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction. Everybody in their generation knows it. Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, you're their generation. I think you would be standing up more — look, that's why I'm standing up for it.\n\nWe cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say we're going to sign this one more deal, we're going to do one more thing without putting climate first. That's why it's my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, your response?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, that's right. This issue is personal for me. It's why we're going to tackle climate from day one. It's why we've got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today. Now, what I've noticed is, pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now.\n\nThe question is, how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades. The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events, raised his hand and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his 90s in the year 2100.\n\nHe will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just re-joining the Paris Climate Accord, that's table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Let's now turn to — let's now turn to an issue that's come up in the last 48 hours. Sen. Sanders, CNN reported yesterday that — and Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?\n\nSANDERS: Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it. And I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States.\n\nGo to YouTube today. There's a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States. In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Sen. Warren. There was a movement to draft Sen. Warren to run for president. And you know what, I said — stayed back. Sen. Warren decided not to run, and I then — I did run afterwards.\n\nHillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the United States? And let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination, I hope that's not the case, I hope it's me.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: So Sen. Sanders — Sen. Sanders, I do want to be clear here, you're saying that you never told Sen. Warren that a woman could not win the election?\n\nSANDERS: That is correct.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren, what did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWARREN: I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised, and it's time for us to attack it head-on.\n\nAnd I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump?\n\nLook at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThe only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... Amy and me.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: So true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.\n\nAnd here's what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency.\n\nWe need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. That's my plan and that is why I'm going to win.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, what do you say to people who don't...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Elizabeth.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, what do you say...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would like to point out...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, let me finish my question.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: What do you say to people who...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I thought it was such an open-end — I wasn't at the meeting, so I can't comment, but I was going to say...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: What do you say to people who say that a woman can't win this election?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I hear that. People have said it. That's why I've addressed it from this stage. I point out that you don't have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was 5'4\". You don't have to be the skinniest person in the room. You don't have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.\n\nAnd when you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer. Kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat Kris Kobach. And her name is — I'm very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly. Thank you.\n\nThird, I would add to this, you have to be competent to win and you have to know what you're doing. And when you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas. I have brought people with me.\n\nThat is why I have the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Because they know I bring people with me.\n\nAnd finally, every single person...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd I think — I think that sounds pretty good. I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, you can respond.\n\nSANDERS: Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress.\n\nWARREN: When?\n\nSANDERS: Nineteen-ninety.\n\nThat's how I won, beat a republican congressman.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNumber two...\n\nWARREN: Thirty years ago.\n\nSANDERS: ... of course, I don't think there's any debate up here...\n\nWARREN: Wasn't it 30 years ago?\n\nSANDERS: I beat an incumbent Republican congressman.\n\nWARREN: And I said I was the only one who's beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I don't know that that's the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is — let's — does anybody in their right mind think that a woman cannot be elected president?\n\nThat's — nobody believes that. Of — Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can't win? Of course, a woman can win.\n\nBut the real question is, how do we beat Trump?\n\n►Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump is 'smart fraud' who will be tough to beat, but Sanders claims he can do it\n\nAnd the only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: We have been endorsed by many grassroots organizations...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren —\n\nSANDERS: That's why...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren, I want to give you the final word.\n\nWARREN: So I do think it's the right question, \"How do we beat Trump?\"\n\nAnd here's the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have out-performed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.\n\nLook, don't deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, \"Could a Catholic win?\"\n\nBack in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win.\n\nIn both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America. That's who we are.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden?\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead.\n\nBIDEN: I agree women can win. And I have went in and campaigned for 27 of them this last — in 2018, the best group I've ever campaigned for, in terms of competence\n\nBut the real issue is who can bring the whole party together, represents all elements of the party, African-American, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight. The fact of the matter is that — I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.\n\nPHILLIP: All right. We're going to take a short break now. The CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Drake University, will be back right after this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: Let's turn to health care, the top issue for Iowa Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for pre-existing conditions. We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that. Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do.\n\nSen. Sanders, you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare For All plan is going to cost. Don't voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars?\n\nSANDERS: Well, what I will tell you is Medicare For All, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.\n\nMedicare For All will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general, while we have 87 million uninsured — uninsured and underinsured, and while 30,000 people die each year.\n\n►In Iowa, Bernie Sanders calls Pete Buttigieg's health care plan 'a failed idea'\n\nUnder Medicare For All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4 percent tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year.\n\nWe save money, comprehensive health care, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exists in our dysfunctional system.\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden, does Sen. Sanders owe voters a price tag on his health care plan?\n\nBIDEN: I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we're going to do and what it's going to cost. And a 4 percent tax on income over $24,000 doesn't even come close to paying for between $30 trillion, and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThat's doubling the entire federal budget per year. There's a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, reinstate — rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and in fact make sure that we, in the process, reduce the cost of — of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the — subsidize it further, and make it everybody — available to everyone.\n\nHere's the deal. That costs a lot of money. That costs $740 billion over 10 years. I lay out how I'd pay for that.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is, when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about are workers paying on average 20 percent of their incomes for health care. That is insane.\n\nYou've got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We're spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.\n\nLook, we have talked about health care for all — in this country — for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide health care to all through a Medicare For All single-payer program.\n\nIt won't be easy, but that is what we have to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: You can do it without that. You can do it without Medicare For All. You can get the same place.\n\nSANDERS: No, you can't.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, your response?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yeah. Sen. Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time. And we agree on this. But what I don't agree with is that we — his position on health care.\n\nThis debate isn't real. I was in Vegas the other day and someone said \"Don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.\"\n\nThat's the problem. Over two-thirds of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not on the bill that you and Sen. Warren on on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don't support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in as speaker.\n\nThe answer is a non-profit public option. The answer is — the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that.\n\nAnd then, finally, what should we do about long-term care? The elephant that doesn't even fit in this room. We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.\n\nMy own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. He's in assisted living. He got married three times — whole other story — so there isn't much there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut then we go to Medicaid, and I've already talked to Catholic Elder Care.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: They're willing to take him in. Our story is better than so many other families. We have to make it easier for long-term care.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: It's not just for seniors. It's also for the sandwich generation.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: People trying to help their parents.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So we need to start with what's happening in America. People are suffering. I'll just pick one: 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription, this is what they needed to get well, and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said it's either groceries or this prescription.\n\nMy approach to this is we've got to get as much as help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one thin dime.\n\nWhat I can do are the things I can do as president on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I'll use the power that's already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV-AIDS drugs. Let's get some relief to those families. And I will defend the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI've got a plan to expand health care, but let's keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do health care, but we're going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut health care for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I'll take our side of the argument any day. We're going to beat him on this.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren. Vice President Biden?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: The proposal I lay out does, in fact, limit drug cost. It sets up — it allows all the drug companies — excuse me, it allows you to — Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. And by the way, there's mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: Look, we've had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable health care is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world. And it makes no sense and the government has to step in.\n\nI do happen to agree with Vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option. But the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nSTEYER: ... the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSen. Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II. How would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country?\n\nSANDERS: No, our plan wouldn't bankrupt the country. And, in fact, it would much improve the well-being of working-class families and the middle class.\n\nLet us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.\n\nWhat we will do through a Medicare for all single-payer program is substantially lower the cost of health care for employers and workers, because we end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend in administrative — the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.\n\nHealth care is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing health care for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act. And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipedream, you have to show how you're going to pay for it.\n\nAnd I would also note practically that the Affordable Care Act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it.\n\nAnd, yes, I think you should show how you're going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This president is treating people out there like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos the way he is adding to our debt.\n\nI am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit, by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.\n\n►From November's Iowa Poll: Majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers shy away from 'Medicare for All'\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And I have shown how I'm going to pay for every single plan...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... capital gains tax going to the personal level, getting rid of oil giveaways.\n\nPHILLIP: Let's move on.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Doing something about the hedge fund loophole. You can go through...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, your time is up. Let's move on to the next question.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... and we can get the money to pay for things.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, you're selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it, yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don't want it, and force them to pay for it. How is that truth in advertising?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, it's making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look, the individual mandate was an important part of the ACA because the system doesn't work if there are free riders.\n\nWhat I'm offering is a choice. You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep. And there's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver health care for all.\n\nAnd my plan is paid for. Look, our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. Now, we've got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it's almost invariably Republican presidents who have added to the deficit, a trillion dollars under this president. And it's why everything I've put forward — from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we're going to make in infrastructure to dealing with climate change — is fully paid for.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum. But not the $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion that we're hearing about from the others. All you've got to do is two things, both of them are commonsense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans, including Americans with insurance, who just can't even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, health care plans that we have, and these plans are paid for.\n\nThe problem is that plans like the mayor's and like the vice president's is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. But they're a small improvement. And that's why it is that they cost so much less, because by themselves, they're not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can't afford to get them filled.\n\nWhat we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1 percent, to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes, we can have them pay. And we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide health care for all our people.\n\nYes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer health care to all of our people. And we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small. We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.\n\nThis would be a game-changer. This would be the biggest thing we've done to American health care in a half-century. Let's measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives.\n\nAnd, yes, we're taking on cost. On prescription drugs, we'll have an out-of-pocket cap, even if you don't get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap. And here's why it's got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they've got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits?\n\nIt makes no sense medically because most of us don't experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don't come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion bills.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Sen. Warren, your response?\n\nWARREN: Look, the numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and co-pays and uncovered expenses and fees. You can't cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about.\n\nThe way we have to approach this is we've got to build this and we've got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families.\n\nBut we have to be willing to work together. We can let people experience what health care is like when it's you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner, with no insurance company standing in the middle.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nWARREN: When people try it and use it, then...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Sen. Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all — that you couldn't get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn't get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then, a few months ago, you said, no, you're going to wait a while to get there.\n\nAnd I think that was some acknowledgment that maybe what we're talking about is true. And I don't buy that it's not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 that your premiums will be cut in half, which is what the nonprofit public option will do.\n\nAnd as you talk, Mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 cosponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can't negotiate for better prices for our seniors.\n\nPHILLIP: Senator...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I will get it done.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, coming to you now. CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Edward from here in Des Moines writes, \"Des Moines is an insurance town. What happens to all the insurance industry — the health insurance industry here if there is Medicare for all? What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?\"\n\nSANDERS: We build in to our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and health care and job training for those people.\n\nBut here is the issue. Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is: the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n\nAnd if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people health care is a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the health care industry...\n\nSTEYER: Can I respond to this?\n\nSANDERS: ... and end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: I just want to emphasize what Sen. Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders said, it's clear. There are two problems. We're spending way too much because corporations own the system and we're not negotiating against those corporations.\n\nAnd we've given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That's all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering.\n\nSen. Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we're going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That's why I'm for term limits. We need to redo Washington, D.C., and...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: ... actually take back the government from the corporations who've bought it.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five — five Democratic presidents couldn't get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal.\n\nSecondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices. You don't have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If, in fact, they charge more than we set the price for, they can — they can, in fact — we can — people can import from abroad, assuming that it is — it is — it is safe.\n\nWe, in fact — it's only yellow, Wolf, OK? And we can, in fact, do all of this and still provide people the option to stay — the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers. If they don't like it, or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.\n\nBLITZER: Let's talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone. That's about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago.\n\nSen. Warren, you've called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government — for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?\n\nWARREN: So, let's do this both ways. What I also have said is, I'm just going to use the power that is available and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin.\n\nWe already have the legal authority with the president to do that. The president just hasn't picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV-AIDS drugs. That's going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately.\n\nBut, you know, there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. They're generic drugs. But the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up.\n\nSo my view is, let's give them a little competition. The government lets contracts for all kind of things. They let contracts to build buildings. They let contracts to build military weapons. Let's let the contracts out. Put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices.\n\nThis is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don't have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mention the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan, 137 things I've found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress — that are legal.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got 14 Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They might have not known what they were voting for. But we got that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI now have an actual bill with Sen. Grassley that does that. And I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market.\n\nThe issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of the Congress.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: They think they own Washington. They don't own me.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And as president, I will get this done.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: We're going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that's especially acute in rural Iowa. We have another question for an Iowa Democratic voter.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, as a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two-thirds of my income. Many families don't have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly, as we've seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality, affordable child care in your first 100 days in office?\n\nChild care in Iowa: Iowa's child care crisis worsens its workforce crisis, business leaders say, and they're digging in to help\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It makes no sense for childcare to cost two-thirds of somebody's income. We've to drive it to 7 percent or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty.\n\nBut this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they're working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense, and it must change, and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.\n\nSubsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education, as well as childcare writ large. We can do that.\n\nAnd until we do, this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap. Because when somebody like the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?\n\nWARREN: No, actually, my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment.\n\nBut understand this about the plan. I've been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom. I had two little kids, and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited. But it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another, and it just didn't work.\n\nIf I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bee — I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on, how many of my daughter's generation get knocked off the track and don't get back on, how many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.\n\nI have a two cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children, and provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That's an investment in our babies. That's an investment in their mamas and their daddies. And it's an investment in our teachers and in our economy.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders, will your...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: It's what we need to do.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... universal childcare program be free for everyone regardless of income?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Let me pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through 4 are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally. And yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment, it is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers.\n\nWe need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of a few countries that does not have universal high-quality affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, tax breaks for billionaires, and then tell the moms and dads in this country we cannot have high-quality affordable childcare.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, I'm coming to you now.\n\nSANDERS: That is wrong.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country. Do you support free universal infant care?\n\nBIDEN: There should be free universal infant care, but here's the deal. You know, I was a single parent, too. When my wife and daughter were killed, my two boys I had to raise. I was a senator, a young senator. I just hadn't been sworn in yet. And I was making $42,000 a year.\n\nI commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware, over 500 miles a day — excuse me, 250 miles a day, because I could not afford but for my family childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it.\n\nAnd that's why there are several things we do. When I triple the amount of money for Title I schools, every child, 3, 4, and 5 years old, will, in fact, have full schooling. They'll go to school and after-school programs, which will release some of the burden.\n\nSecondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit which would put 7 million women back to work that could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who, in fact, are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care.\n\nBut Bernie's right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care. And I provide for that, as well. My time is up, I know, but I'm not going to go over like everybody.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg — Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families. You oppose free public college for all because you don't want to make it, quote, \"free for the kids of millionaires.\" But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people, like libraries and public schools. Why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, it's simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade. It's not the same for college. Now, again, I don't want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college. And under my plan, it won't be.\n\nAs a matter of fact, for the first 80 percent of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges. But if you're in that top income bracket, don't get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition, because we could be using those dollars for something else.\n\nThere is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise, and we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure, and something that hasn't come up very much tonight but deserves a lot of attention, poverty.\n\nYou know, the Poor People's Campaign is marching on Iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think because even though in politics we're supposed to talk middle class, they know there's no scripture that says as you've done unto the middle class, so you've done unto me.\n\nWe've got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference. And I don't think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition at public colleges is the best use of those scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So, look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more. And that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes.\n\nIf he wants to send his kid to public university, then I'm OK with that, because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place, to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay, because that's how we build an economy and, for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt.\n\nYou do universal childcare and you've got a lot of mamas who can go to work, a lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We've got a lot of people who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yeah, you know, I appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back. I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren't actually thinking big enough.\n\nI think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings? And what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home health care workers that we don't know how to fill in the next 10 years. We are going to have open 100,000 jobs for nursing assistants. We— as my union friends know — we're going to have over 70,000 openings for electricians.\n\nWe're not going to have a shortage of MBAs. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers. So when we look at that, then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K through 12. It should go into free one- and two-year degrees, like my dad got, like my sister got.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And then we should double the Pell grants, because we're going to need four-year degrees...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. Mr. Steyer...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... so the money goes where it should go, instead of to rich kids going to college.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, as a billionaire, should your children have been entitled to free public college?\n\nSTEYER: No. And let me say this. I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust, and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need.\n\nBut I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education, because we're talking a lot about college. But, in fact, if you talk about the Poor People's Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that's relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance, so we're not legislating inequality for the next generation, and so we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.\n\nBLITZER: We'll be back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa. Stay right here.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBLITZER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential debate. We're live in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nTomorrow, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the United States Senate, launching the third trial of a U.S. president. The Republican-led Senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him.\n\nVice President Biden, if you're the nominee, is it going to be harder to run against President Trump if he's been acquitted and able to claim vindication, especially after what he's said about your family?\n\nBIDEN: It's irrelevant. There's no — there's no choice but to — for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has, in fact, committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not, it's for them to decide.\n\n►Iowa Poll: Iowa voters are split on impeachment\n\nBut — and, by the way, I'm told that, you know, we — that I don't — I say we have to unite the country and it's going to be harder after this trial. It may be. But, look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican Party. They've got gone after — savaged my surviving son, gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won't even carry on television because they're flat-out lies.\n\nAnd I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn't done his job. And so it doesn't really matter whether or not he's gone after me. I've got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can't hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, that's what I will attempt to do, notwithstanding that — we're going to be more division after he's defeated by me this next time.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, you're going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that's about to start. Do you worry President Trump will be emboldened by acquittal?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: No. We have a constitutional duty to do — to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, it's whether or not we're going to be able to have witnesses. We've asked for only four people as witnesses. And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn't want to be ruled by a king.\n\nAnd I think the best way to think about this is trial and what we're facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the Army counsel. And he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man.\n\nEveryone that was afraid, they were afraid of being blacklisted, Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, have you no sense of decency, sir? Have you no sense of decency. This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Not only is this trial that...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... but also this election. And no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... to Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, you have spent millions and millions of dollars telling the American people that President Trump deserves to be impeached. Will it have been worth if it he has been impeached but not removed from office?\n\n►Who's spending the most on political ads in Iowa? Tom Steyer leads the pack.\n\nSTEYER: Well, Wolf, actually what I have done is to organize a petition drive of 8.5 million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those 8.5 million people have called their congresspeople, have emailed their congresspeople, and have actually dragged Washington, D.C., to see that in fact this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.\n\nSo if you ask me whether standing up for what's right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the Constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn't worth it, then you don't share the idea that I do about what America is about.\n\nStanding up for what's right is always worth it, Wolf. And I will never back down from that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa Caucuses here. How big of a problem is that for you as you're making your closing pitch to voters here?\n\nWARREN: Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial. I will be there because it is my responsibility.\n\nBut understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That is what lies at heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first. Not the American people. Not the interests of the United States of America. Not even helping Ukraine defend against Russia.\n\nIt is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats we're not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That's why we're here.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Let's turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa parts of the state remain under water after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages. Today many Iowans are still displaced from their homes.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, you have talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding. But what do you do about farms and factories that simply can't be moved?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. Seeing it in Iowa. We have seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once-in-a-millennium flood. Then two years later had to do the same thing.\n\nIn Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical and this is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes, to adapt, to make sure communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other.\n\nBut we also have to ensure that we don't allow this to get any worse. And if we get right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them, whether we're talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: But, Mayor Buttigieg...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... in the national project to do something about it.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... to clarify, what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories, and that disproportionately happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nMr. Steyer, what's your response?\n\nSTEYER: Look, what you're talking about is what's called managed retreat. It's basically saying we're going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control. And it's unbelievably expensive. And of course we'll come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble.\n\nBut this is why climate is my number one priority. And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can't breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, we're going to create millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. It's going to be the biggest job program in American history.\n\nSo I know we have to do it. I know we can do it. And I know that we can do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid, and is more just. But the truth of the matter is, we're going to have to do it and we're going to have to make the whole world come along with us. And it's going to have to be...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer...\n\nSTEYER: ... priority one.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you're the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?\n\nSTEYER: I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy. And over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the Giving Pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive. And for 12 years I have been fighting the climate crisis.\n\nI have beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I have stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says, I'll make it priority one, because I have been doing it for a long time.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSen. Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipeline and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can't overturn?\n\nWARREN: Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. And the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and offshore drilling. That will help us get in the right directions. I'll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution.\n\nWe should see this for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.\n\nBut you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on health care, on all of the issues that matter to us.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nSen. Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all-out ban on fracking. You haven't. Why not?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, I would note that I have 100 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters. And that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems.\n\nAnd one thing that hasn't been raised, by the way, is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It's a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral.\n\nNearly every o", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/29/election-2020-st-george-southwest-utah-candidates-voter-guide/5855662002/", "title": "Election 2020: St. George and southwest Utah candidates voter guide", "text": "As if the first eleven months of the year weren't enough, 2020 will end in a political crescendo as the nation elects its next set of local, state and national leaders.\n\nBut do you know all of the names on your ballot?\n\nFrom the county commission to U.S. Congress, The Spectrum has compiled this guide to help introduce voters in Washington County to the candidates hoping to represent them.\n\nThis list has been limited to races that are competitive, or contests where voters will get to choose between more than one candidate.

No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nMy values are fairness, dignity and equality for everyone. Inequality has divided us. This is why I am running for office - to improve people's lives.\n\nSALES TAX: I think it's time for families to have a tax break. The question on sales tax in my opinion is just common sense. We are buying at online rather than our local brick and mortar businesses. We need to decrease the local sales tax and increase the online sales tax.\n\nINCOME TAX: We also need to go back to a fair income tax and get rid of the flat tax. Families deserve an income tax cut - especially in these times of crisis. My plan will solve the future concerns about tax restructuring without penalizing our education funding.\n\nWe have a higher proportion of our people of color being incarcerated, being infected with corona-virus and, yes, being killed.

No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nI have lived most of my life in this area. It makes me happy and satisfied, albeit with weight of mantle of expectations, when I live up to reputations of honesty, intelligence, and that I will be the one happy to help.\n\nMy campaign/service will have 6 A’s: accessibility, accountability, advancement, advocacy, affordability, and automation. 1 for each bill a legislator may propose per session.\n\nIn line with accessibility, I intend to move the district office to be within district boundaries.\n\nIn line with accountability, I intend to allow for voting by all constituents in the district to determine what the vote will be on each matter.\n\nI intend to encourage advancement of technologies, particularly those that help/prevent persisting problems. I am fascinated by the idea of having hydrogen fuel cell and generating energy while producing water at the same time, especially since we live in a desert.\n\nBeing an advocate is a profession that was suggested to me when I said what I already was trying to do to speak up on behalf of others with unmet needs.\n\nAffordability for both the constituent and the state. We could divide composing textbooks among those qualified already on public payroll, and so on.\n\nThe intent of the automation is for alleviating costs, delays, and shortages of professionals and services in such as in education, government, and medical.\n\nTravis M. Seegmiller\n\nParty: Republican\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? Yes. Seegmiller was appointed to the house on Valentines Day 2018, filling the seat vacated by Jon Stanard after he resigned in the wake of allegations that he'd hired a prostitute. He was reelected to that position that same year at the end of his appointed term.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nRepresentative Travis M.

No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nMy name is Kenzie Carter and I am running for Utah House District 74 to be a voice for change.\n\nI have spent 20 years in a career helping people. I have experienced how the system works, both personally and professionally. I understand how the system benefits some, but not others and I feel the current legislature does not act in the best interest of its constituents. The marginalized and vulnerable have been left behind, the middle class is shrinking, people are required to do more with less and can barely get by.\n\nI think about the futile efforts of trying to pass a tax bill that puts additional strain on families’ ability to get food and basic services. I think of voters approving propositions on a ballot, only to have the legislature take liberties to change the voice of the people. It’s time the people became the priority.\n\nI want transparency and honesty from our elected officials. I want responsible spending of tax payer funds. I want efficient use of time and resources invested in the issues that matter most to you. My areas of focus include healthcare, adequate funding of public schools, childcare and early childhood development programs, livable wages, attainable housing, environment, homelessness, LGBTQ+ and women’s rights.\n\nPlease go to my web page www.kenziecarterforhd74.com for more information.\n\nLowry Snow\n\nParty: Republican\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? Yes. Snow has represented HD 74 since 2012 when he was appointed by Gov. Gary Herbert after David Clark vacated the seat to make a bid for congress. He has been reelected to that seat four times.\n\nBrief Bio:\n\nI’ve lived in southern Utah with my wife, Sheryl, for over 40 years and practice law at Snow Jensen & Reece.\n\nI serve in the legislature as Chair of the House Education Committee and as member of Education Appropriations and House Judiciary Committees. My state board service includes the Legislative Water Commission and member and Co-Chair of the Point of the Mountain Land Authority.\n\nLocally, I serve on the Central Utah Red Cross Board and the St. George Area Economic Development Board, where I’ve served for over 20 years, including as former Chair. In the past, I chaired Utah’s Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission, charged with evaluating and reporting the performance of every judge in Utah.\n\nAs legislator, I have successfully sponsored legislation dealing with education, protection of children and victims of abuse, criminal justice reform, water law, and protections for military veterans and the elderly. I believe we need a strong voice and tenacious advocate representing southern Utah in the legislature, and I’ve been that voice throughout my service. I’m committed to listening to and working with constituents, stakeholders, and other lawmakers to find solutions to issues important to our community and state.\n\nMy legislative work and voting record illustrate my commitment to fiscal conservatism, federalism, and my belief that providing necessary resources for our children and our most vulnerable citizens builds stronger communities and more sustainable economies.\n\nState House District 75\n\nEncompassing the core of St. George, including the downtown area, HD 75 stretches north and widens to include Veyo, Gunclock and Pine Valley, all the way to Enterprise.\n\nThe seat is currently held by Walt Brooks, who is running for reelection in 2020.\n\nRebecca Sullivan\n\nParty: Democrat\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nI grew up in Ogden and worked at the IRS Service Center. As a divorced single mother of two young children, it was important that I advance in my career. I worked hard, went to college at night, and was promoted in my career with IRS. After 25 years of service I retired as a GS 14, with a group of 12 Administrative Judges and six Auditors reporting to me.\n\nIssues:\n\nProp 4: Redistricting will be decided next year but I do not believe our representatives will allow fair lines to be drawn, considering what they did with Props 2 and 3.\n\nLake Powell Pipeline: Too costly, too risky, and unnecessary.\n\nNorthern Corridor: Damages the Red Cliffs National Conservation area.\n\nHealthcare: We need affordable healthcare options, especially considering the impact of COVID19 and the loss of so many employer-sponsored healthcare programs.\n\nK-12 education: Teachers in Utah deserve a pay raise. We have the lowest funding per student in the United States, so many teachers buy supplies out of their own pockets. We also have the highest number of students per classroom in the United States. We can fix this.\n\nState taxes. In 2018 we voted against the 10 cent a gallon gas tax. In 2019 and 2020 the State Legislators bypassed voters by proposing a slight decrease to our flat tax rate on income and an increase to taxes on gas, food, and services. A better solution is to change from a flat tax rate, which benefits the high-income residents, to a progressive tax rate, like we had prior to 2007.\n\nWalt Brooks\n\nParty: Republican\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? Yes. Brooks was appointed to the state house in Sept. 2016 and quickly defended his seat in the 2016 election. Brooks' appointment filled the seat vacated by Don Ipson, who was appointed to the state senate after Steve Urquhart resigned.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nBrooks did not return The Spectrum's candidate Q&A, which provided candidates the opportunity to introduce themselves to voters in a brief bio.\n\nU.S. Congress\n\nVoters in southwestern Utah this year will get to choose who represents them in the U.S. House of Representatives for the next two years.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, Utah Congressional District 2\n\nIf you measure by land area alone, Utah's largest congressional district is up for grabs this year.\n\nStretching from the midpoint of the Great Salt Lake south to the Arizona border, Congressional District 2 encompasses a huge swath of Utah's western half. Voters from St. George, north to Wendover and east to Farmington and Canyonlands National Park will get a chance to cast their ballot in the is race.\n\nThe seat is currently held by Rep. Chris Stewart, who is running for reelection in 2020.\n\nChris Stewart\n\nParty: Republican\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? Yes. Stewart was first elected to represent CD2 in 2012, serving a total of four terms.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nMy family creed is Duty, Honor, Service to God, Family, and Country. I grew up on a small farm in northern Utah, defended my country as an Air Force B1 pilot, and have the record for fastest non-stop flight around the world. I was a small business owner, and I have written 20 books including NY Times Best Sellers.\n\nIn my 8 years in Congress I have fought against the power of the federal government and I have delivered results for you and Utah. I have earned President Trump’s trust and confidence and Congressional Leadership recognizes me as a leader on conservative fiscal policy and national security. I am the only Republican in Congress on both Budget Committee and Appropriations Committee.\n\nI also serve on the House Intelligence Committee. I have also fought the tough fights that most others avoid, including founding the Anti-Socialism Caucus, passed bills on suicide prevention, introduced legislation protecting religious freedom, legislation prohibiting tobacco and vaping from targeting children, forcing better multiple use land management, FISA reform, rebuilding our military, and many others.\n\nAbove all, I firmly believe that while we are not yet perfect, America continues to be great and exceptional. This election will determine whether we continue to strive to be a more perfect union, or whether we fundamentally change the definition of America. I defended American greatness before and I will continue to do so now with your help.\n\nKael Weston\n\nParty: Democrat\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nSeven years in two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, taught me that bad policy gets people killed. I represented our country for over a decade and my years with the State Department gave me a unique perspective on the crucial importance of leadership, service, empathy, courage, and ethics. Serving as a bridge builder in both war zones gave me the skills to serve the people of Utah’s 2nd Congressional district as their representative.\n\nOur politics are failing people, particularly the disenfranchised and vulnerable. America’s system of checks and balances requires public servants of conscience and wisdom, not allegiance to partisanship and division. We must insist on the highest standards of conduct and judgment in our politicians—or fire them and hire those willing to listen and lead. Small people in big jobs create division instead of focusing on healthcare, a living wage, climate, civil rights, education, and the necessary post-COVID economic recovery. It is going to take all of us working together—Democrats, Republicans, unaffiliated—to rebuild our economy and make sure our country does not leave anyone behind. We need accountability and ethics in Congress. We need a willingness to represent the forgotten people of Utah. We need serious leadership for serious times.\n\nGovernor of Utah\n\nThe state of Utah has been led by a Republican since 1985. Will that streak continue through the next four years?\n\nChris Peterson\n\nRunning mate (for Lt. Governor): Karina Brown\n\nParty: Democrat\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? No.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nChris Peterson is a fifth-generation Utahn, father, husband, and law professor at the University of Utah. He was raised by a disabled, single mother in West Valley City. After the financial crisis of 2008, Peterson helped build the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—a federal agency dedicated to ensuring banks and other financial businesses treat customers fairly. Peterson’s team stopped illegal practices by Wall Street banks, payday lenders, and debt collectors, returning nearly $12 billion in restitution to working Americans. Peterson also served at the Department of Defense where he helped lead the Pentagon’s efforts to prevent predatory lending to military families.\n\nPeterson’s lieutenant governor running mate is Karina Brown. Brown lives with her husband and four children in Nibley, Utah. She was a founding sponsor of Proposition 3, the Medicaid Expansion ballot initiative, approved by Utah voters in 2018. Brown serves on the Cache Valley Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, is the President of the Friends of Cache County Children’s Justice Board, and a Nibley planning commissioner—a true leader in her community.\n\nPeterson and Brown believe that for too long, Utah’s one-party legislature has not listened to voters. If elected, they will listen to voters and respect the will of the people. Right now, Utah politicians are doing the bidding for party insiders, elites, and lobbyists. Peterson and Brown will fight for all Utahns and hope to earn your vote.\n\nSpencer Cox\n\nRunning mate (for Lt. Governor): Deidre Henderson\n\nParty: Republican\n\nHas the candidate previously held a public office? Yes. Cox has held public office since 2004, starting with a seat on the Fairview City Council. He was then elected mayor of Fairview in 2006; then to the Sanpete County Commission in 2008; then to the Utah House of Representatives in 2013; and to Lt. Governor shortly after that, where he's served since.\n\nHenderson has represented District 7 in the Utah State Senate since 2013.\n\nBrief bio:\n\nSpencer Cox has served as Lt. Gov. with Gov. Herbert since 2013. He began public service on the Fairview City Council and then served as mayor, county commissioner, and state legislator while leading a family-owned telecommunications company that doubled in size during the Great Recession. As the first candidate for governor in state history to visit all 248 cities and towns, Spencer won the Republican convention and Republican primary. If elected, Spencer promises to rebuild our economy, protect public health, and prioritize education. He and his wife, Abby, have four children and live on their family farm in Sanpete County.\n\nSenator Deidre Henderson was elected to the Utah State Senate in 2012. She currently serves as the Chair of the Senate Education Committee and previously chaired the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee and the Senate Rules Committee. Senator Henderson is a champion of government transparency, advocates for low taxes, is dedicated to removing onerous regulations for Utah businesses, and has always been committed to listening to the voices of those who feel they are not being heard. She has been married to her husband, Gabe, for 27 years. They are the parents of five children.\n\nTogether, they believe Utah has the potential to show the rest of the country how to treat others, reach consensus on difficult issues, and build thriving communities. Regardless of the result of this election, their campaign will seek to restore civility and be a force for good.\n\n——\n\nSam Gross covers the outdoors and development in Southern Utah for The St. George Spectrum & Daily News.

Raquel Terán and Duane Wooten, a doctor, are competing for the Democratic nomination.\n\nRepublican Jeff Zink and Jesus David Mendoza are running for the GOP nomination. Alan Aversa is running as a Green Party candidate.\n\nArizona's 3rd Congressional District is in Maricopa County. It stretches across parts of Phoenix — including the communities of south Phoenix, Laveen and Maryvale — and Glendale.\n\nWhich district do you live in? Find your elected officials in Congress and other Arizona offices\n\nThe candidates' responses are below.\n\nThe candidates are listed in alphabetical order by party.\n\nDemocratic candidates\n\nYassamin Ansari\n\nOccupation: Phoenix City Councilwoman, District 7\n\nPhoenix City Councilwoman, District 7 Relevant experience: Phoenix City Councilwoman and Vice Mayor, climate policy adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General, and organizer\n\nPhoenix City Councilwoman and Vice Mayor, climate policy adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General, and organizer Age: 32\n\n32 Party: Democrat\n\nName two big problems facing the district you’re running to represent and how you would address them if elected.\n\nHousing affordability. In Arizona, working one job should afford you a safe place to call home and essentials such as food and transportation – but that’s not the reality right now. In Congress, I will expand upon my work delivering better housing policy and fight to make sure Phoenix gets its fair share of funding for housing choice vouchers. I will also support legislation that provides more pathways to home ownership. Delivering the Economy of the Future. While traditional modeling shows a strong economy, it’s an economy that isn’t working for everyone. We must ensure that the next generation has access to quality jobs and that wages keep up with rising living costs. As a Congresswoman, I’ll invest in public education and reduce student debt, raise the federal minimum wage, and bring the public transit infrastructure that will get communities to the new, high-wage jobs created by the Biden Administration.\n\nWhich recent political figure do you most admire, and why?\n\nAs the youngest woman and first Iranian-American to serve on the Phoenix City Council, I’m now running to be the youngest woman in Congress and I owe much of that to the road that President Barack Obama paved for my generation.\n\nWhen I was 16, I was lucky to have now-State Senator Christine Marsh as my AP English teacher. It was her commitment to discussions focused on civic engagement in the classroom that led me to join the Arizona Democratic Party and the Obama campaign as a junior in high school.\n\nI’m very fortunate to have had that opportunity and am proud to continue to employ high school, college, and graduate students in my office and on my campaign. We’re organizing across Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District to get young people excited to vote. I’m looking forward to continuing that legacy in shaping our future together at every level of government.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to make life more affordable for ordinary Arizonans?\n\nThere are several things that Congress can do for Arizonans to make life more affordable. Lowering the costs of living for working families in areas like healthcare, education, and housing are where I plan to take direct action. We don’t have to wait until we hit a financial crisis or face another public health disaster to fund programming that lifts people out of poverty.\n\nAs Phoenix Vice Mayor, I helped direct federal funding toward free mental health care, access to fresh food, affordable internet, rental assistance, and the Phoenix Promise Program, which provided tuition for hundreds of first-generation students pursuing a community college education.\n\nIn February, I unveiled a policy plan to make housing more attainable through the Housing Crisis Response Act (HCRA), which invests in affordable housing and homeownership in order to level the playing field for many residents who are competing with out-of-state corporate investors.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to reform federal immigration policy?\n\nAs the daughter of immigrants, I firmly believe that the economy, culture and spirit of our country benefit from immigration. There is bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform — and it is far past time that lawmakers move beyond political games and strive toward practical solutions that align with both the economic and humanitarian priorities of the United States.\n\nIn Arizona, immigrants make up about one-sixth of Arizona's labor force and have exponential spending power.\n\nIn Congress, I will pursue legislation that helps address asylum processing, visa backlogs and a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants, including essential farmworkers, temporary protected status recipients and Dreamers. Further, as we continue to invest in emerging technology domestically – including biotech and semiconductor manufacturing – we need immigration reform that allows the best and brightest from around the world to start their technology companies here in the United States.\n\nWhat do you believe is the biggest threat to national security, and how should we handle it?\n\nI earned degrees in international relations and security studies from Stanford and Cambridge universities, and prior to elected office, I served as a United Nations climate advisor, solidifying my view that climate change is the biggest threat to international security — a view shared by the Pentagon.\n\nWe’re already seeing an increase in climate refugees abroad and domestically. Severe droughts and fire are wiping out homes in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and across the Western United States. As these areas become more difficult to live in, many will look for a better life elsewhere, exacerbating already challenged immigration systems, economies, and housing supplies.\n\nAs pressure builds, we’re likely to see more conflict and unsafe conditions in previously peaceful areas. It’s of the utmost importance that the United States play a lead role in helping developing nations become more climate resilient through funding soft power programs like the International Affairs Budget.\n\nWhat would you change about the US’ response to climate change, if anything?\n\nThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time, which is why I have dedicated my career toward advancing solutions to address it. I served as an advisor on the climate teams of two UN Secretaries-General, and as a Councilwoman, I helped pass the city’s first-ever Climate Action Plan.\n\nIf we want to reduce the worst impacts of climate change and save lives, we need to reach 100% net zero by 2050 and establish programs that mitigate extreme heat. We need to go beyond the landmark legislation passed in DC recently.\n\nThat means going all-in for a 100% clean energy grid, weatherizing homes and buildings to make them more efficient, and building a high-speed train and transit system both across the country and locally in our cities. We need to make it easier to get around without a car or a plane and we need federal investment to do that.\n\nDo you feel confident that the 2024 election will be held securely and fairly? If not, what are your concerns?\n\nArizona has one of the most secure and modern election systems in the nation, and I’m wholeheartedly confident fair elections will be conducted in 2024 – as they always have been. It’s why more than 75% of residents vote by mail here and why we’ve been recognized for our efforts in improving accessibility to the ballot box in our tribal nations, for example.\n\nI’m deeply grateful for the election workers, administrators, and volunteers that protect our right to vote and the integrity of our political process.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to mention any other important issue you’dlike to discuss.\n\nFirstly, I believe that every single person deserves autonomy over their own body and their own medical decisions. That’s why, when Roe was overturned, I led the charge to pass an ordinance in Phoenix to make enforcement of Arizona’s archaic abortion ban the lowest priority for law enforcement – because no doctor, nurse or patient should go to jail for providing or receiving healthcare. In Congress, I’ll fight tirelessly for legislation that guarantees the protection of reproductive rights nationwide for future generations.\n\nSecondly, the safety of our children and families will continue to be a top priority. I grew up as part of the Columbine generation, with mass shooting drills at school and in college. I’ll never stop advocating for common-sense gun safety reform. We can and must reinstate the assault weapons ban, which Congress allowed to expire in 2004, to keep dangerous weapons out of the wrong hands.\n\nRaquel Terán\n\nOccupation: Candidate for Congress\n\nCandidate for Congress Relevant experience: Community Organizer, Coalition campaigner that helped oust Senate President Russell Pearce and Sheriff Arpaio, State Representative, Senate Minority Leader, Chair of Arizona Democratic Party\n\nCommunity Organizer, Coalition campaigner that helped oust Senate President Russell Pearce and Sheriff Arpaio, State Representative, Senate Minority Leader, Chair of Arizona Democratic Party Age: 46\n\n46 Party: Democrat\n\nName two big problems facing the district you’re running to represent and how you would address them if elected.\n\nIssue 1-Housing\n\nToo many Arizona families cannot afford to own or rent homes. Corporations andprivate investors are maximizing profits by driving up housing costs and absorbing thesupply of homes. Federal policies need to address unethical landlord practices andregulate the housing market so that private investors cannot drive up the costs.\n\nIssue 2-Affordable Healthcare/Access to Abortion\n\nI aim to expand access and the affordability of healthcare. I’m committed to improvingpreventive medicine, expanding mental health services, and promoting a comprehensiveapproach to well-being.\n\nThe right to an abortion is healthcare and the threat of a full, national abortion ban is real. InCongress, I will fight to restore the national right to abortion and this November, we must passthe Arizona for Abortion Access Act. I am proud to be endorsed by Planned Parenthood ActionFund and Reproductive Freedoms for All.\n\nWhich recent political figure do you most admire, and why?\n\nI admire and deeply respect the late Congressman Ed Pastor. He was the first Latino torepresent Arizona. His priority was to be the most effective member of Congress for hiscommunity, serving as a deputy whip and on the Appropriations Committee. Pastor advocatedand secured hundreds of millions dollars for public transit to improve the lives of families. Hegrew up in a working-class family in the mining town of Claypool and his background reflectedthe hard work ethic of his district.\n\nI also admire leaders who do not get the attention like well-known political figures. Leaders likePatty Rosas. I met Patty during a hunger strike for immigration reform in the late 2000s. Patty iscivically engaged, advocates for immigration reform, and supports her community no matter herchallenges. She represents a conviction found in people who step up for their community everyday.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to make life more affordable for ordinary Arizonans?\n\nThere are many options for immediate economic relief to Arizonans. We can work toincrease the federal funding for affordable housing as well as improve mortgage andbank regulations. Hedge funds are hurting our communities by reducing housingsupply while they line their pockets with the demand they are artificially creating.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the Child Tax Credit was increased which dropped child povertydramatically. I am committed to working to restore this tax credit for our familiesimmediately.\n\nWe need to ensure that workers in Arizona and across the country are paid a fair livingwage. The cost of living has become more expensive, but the federal minimum wagehasn’t been raised since 2009.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to reform federal immigration policy?\n\nI was born and raised on the street that divides the United States from Mexico on the Arizonaborder. Growing up, I witnessed anti-immigrant sentiment rise and hate start to take hold. That’swhy I got involved in politics.\n\nThey said we couldn’t do it, but we organized to fight the notorious SB 1070 “show me yourpapers” racial profiling law. And I worked to create a coalition to oust sitting Senate PresidentRussell Pearce and Sheriff Arpaio.\n\nSince then, we have not seen reform at a federal level. Instead, we've continued to seeimmigration used as a political wedge. We need to modernize our immigration system to meetthe needs of today’s economy. It must include a pathway to citizenship for DREAMERS and thereunification of immigrant families. I would use my almost-20-years of experience to finallydeliver the reform our country needs to move forward.\n\nWhat do you believe is the biggest threat to national security, and how should we handle it?\n\nOur democracy is under assault. Extremist candidates like Donald Trump and Kari Lakethreaten the very foundation our democracy is built on – silencing voices at home andjeopardizing our relationships abroad.\n\nAs the Arizona Democratic Party state chair, I brought together a coalition to reject GOPextremists and re-elect Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in a purple state. For the first time indecades, the Secretary of State and Attorney General are both Democrats. That’s the power wecan harness when we come together with a vision of Arizona that includes all of us.\n\nYet, MAGA extremists continue to undermine elections with misinformation and scare tacticshere in Arizona, and nationally. We have to fight back these threats to our democracy andensure that all Americans can participate in free and fair elections without fear of manipulationor intimidation.\n\nWhat would you change about the US’ response to climate change, if anything?\n\nClimate change is here and the ramifications will be felt by our children and grandchildren. Theimpact is disproportionately felt by communities of color and communities not in the 1%. I thinkabout my own son and the planet he is inheriting.\n\nThe United States should lead global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions but instead,extremist GOP have removed the United States from international climate efforts altogether. It’simportant that our country return to the negotiating table to champion ideas that hold pollutersaccountable.\n\nAt the federal level, I’d champion an aggressive economic agenda to build green infrastructureand create high-paying, union jobs. We need to increase resources like home weatherizationand water usage to address today’s impacts while building for the future.\n\nDo you feel confident that the 2024 election will be held securely and fairly? If not, what are your concerns?\n\nI am confident that the 2024 election will continue to be held securely and fairly. Arizona hasunfortunately been a breeding ground for MAGA Extremist election deniers. They arethreatening our democracy and I will not stand by while they continue to undermine confidencein our elections.\n\nAs Arizona Secretary of State, Governor Katie Hobbs exposed the fraudit for a taxpayer-fundedgiveaway of $4 million, that only lined the pockets of conspiracy theorists.\n\nI am no stranger to the extremism of MAGA Republicans in Congress. For years, I foughtagainst extremists in the Arizona legislature and brought light to the damage that they weredoing to our communities.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to mention any other important issue you’dlike to discuss.\n\nRight now, our community and our country needs leaders with proven experience that willdeliver solutions and fight off extremist attempts to undermine and take away our rights. Ourcommunities need a representative that has always prioritized working families rather thanspecial interests, and a record that proves it.\n\nArizona has never sent a Latina mom to Congress and it is important that our Congress reflectsthe communities it represents. I am proud of the diverse coalition supporting my campaign forCongress. I have knocked on thousands of doors and listened to hundreds of residentsbecause there are no shortcuts to public service.\n\nThe strength of our coalitions and relationships will be key to facing the myriad challengesahead. We must build and nurture strong coalitions to address the critical issues facing ourfamilies and our nation, ensuring a collaborative approach to governance that prioritizes thewell-being of Arizonans and all Americans.\n\nDuane Wooten\n\nOccupation: Pediatrician\n\nPediatrician Relevant experience: Nearly 40 years’ experience providing medical care to constituents in CD3 and has been consistently engaged with community organizations focused on the well-being of citizens.\n\nNearly 40 years’ experience providing medical care to constituents in CD3 and has been consistently engaged with community organizations focused on the well-being of citizens. Age: 64\n\n64 Party: Democrat\n\nName two big problems facing the district you’re running to represent and how you would address them if elected.\n\nIn my practice, I directly see some of the challenges that residents in the district face. I would say that homelessness for families with children, particularly young families facing eviction, is a top challenge. On the other end of the spectrum, would be adequate and affordable housing for seniors. One solution would be to examine current budgets to prioritize funds that would be directed to address this trend and to expedite federal funds to agencies that are doing the work and that need greater support. Another is to repurpose vacant buildings and to collaborate via public/private partnerships to increase the scale for affordable homes. The second problem facing citizens is access to healthcare. I want to make true universal healthcare a priority; and I support expanding the existing Affordable Care Act to address coverage gaps.\n\nWhich recent political figure do you most admire, and why?\n\nOn the local level, I’ve been inspired by people such as the Honorable Mel Hannah, who, before his passing in 2023, was a great civic leader in the Phoenix area and who had once served on the Flagstaff city council. I’ve watched former State Senator Leah Landrum-Taylor demonstrate great leadership in serving the public. Of course, I must mention the great John Lewis, although he is no longer with us, his story is one that demonstrates serving the public with courage and civility.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to make life more affordable for ordinary Arizonans?\n\nAs a doctor, as mentioned earlier, affordable, and universal health care; expand the Affordable Care Act to include services that are costly for the elderly and his risk communities. I also believe that to address any of the quality-of-life issues that impact citizens from any walk of life, that the biggest thing Congress can do is to put aside the bickering, commit to collaborating in the spirit of truly being United States of America.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to reform federal immigration policy?\n\nI support a bi-partisan bill that seeks to enforce our laws, and I understand the need to balance safety, security, and the humanitarian aspect of what is currently transpiring along our borders. This is truly an example where a commitment to work together is needed.\n\nWhat do you believe is the biggest threat to national security, and how should we handle it?\n\nThe level of divisiveness that exists at many levels throughout our county. When we fail to see, hear, or even attempt to understand each other, and when more time is spent pointing fingers to prove who is right or who is wrong, that level of discord plants seeds for internal threats; and while we are distracted and arguing with each other, exposes us to external ones as well. We must always remember and hold to our hearts that we are the UNITED States of America. I will work to bring diplomacy and practical solutions to the best and most effective way to govern. As a physician, I know what it means to CARE for others.\n\nWhat would you change about the US’ response to climate change, if anything?\n\nHaving clean air to breathe, access to drinkable water, and especially for those of us that live in the Sonoran Desert, livable temperatures, these are just some of the basics that help measure quality of life and well-being. I support bi-partisan efforts to implement infrastructure laws and partnering with communities for environmental justice. This is an urgent matter that has to take one of the top priorities in order to save our planet.\n\nDo you feel confident that the 2024 election will be held securely and fairly? If not, what are your concerns?\n\nYes, I do. I recently had the opportunity to do a group tour of the elections office and learned about the internal controls that are in place for secure and fair elections.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to mention any other important issue you’dlike to discuss.\n\nEssentially, I’m seeking to find solutions that address the safety and well-being of the citizens that live in District 3. I believe that issues such as food insecurity in this region can be addressed in a manner that results in a win-win; for instance, by supporting local farmers and looking at the supply chain infrastructure, we can address inflationary costs and improve economic development through regional efforts. With focusing on growing local business we can also greatly reduce transportation costs of needed products and this too can help to lower the cost of essential necessities.\n\nArizona election 2024: Here's everything to know about registering and voting\n\nRepublican candidates\n\nJesus David Mendoza\n\nOccupation: Software engineer\n\nSoftware engineer Relevant experience: Years in the software/data side of health care, logistics, and education plus my academic background in political science, human rights, and international business.\n\nYears in the software/data side of health care, logistics, and education plus my academic background in political science, human rights, and international business. Age: 29\n\n29 Party: Republican\n\nName two big problems facing the district you’re running to represent and how you would address them if elected.\n\nPartisanship and quality of life. Through reasoned and civil discourse, we can aim to boost economic opportunity, education, and sustainable infrastructure for communities.\n\nWhich recent political figure do you most admire, and why?\n\nRon Paul.

This includes opening up the Keystone pipeline and expanding drilling in America and become an export nation again. Additionally, I'll attract manufacturing companies to Congressional District 3 by offering tax incentives by putting these companies on native American land, streamlining regulations, and supporting workforce development initiatives to create more good-paying jobs for our community.\n\nWhich recent political figure do you most admire, and why?\n\nI admire both Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan for their commitment to challenging the Washington establishment and revitalizing the economy. They each demonstrated strong leadership in addressing issues like military strength and inflation, ultimately benefiting the American people.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to make life more affordable for ordinary Arizonans?\n\nTo make life more affordable for Arizonans, Congress should consider implementing tariffs on goods from other countries to protect domestic industries and jobs. Additionally, prioritizing the revival of manufacturing within the U.S. while ensuring military components are exclusively produced domestically can stimulate job growth and reduce dependency on foreign imports, ultimately benefiting ordinary Arizonans.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to reform federal immigration policy?\n\nTo make life more affordable for Arizonans, Congress should consider implementing tariffs on goods from other countries to protect domestic industries and jobs.

They are stealing technology and creating vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. We must enact policies to prevent foreign ownership of American assets. We must tighten border security by enforcing legal immigration processes. This includes stricter regulations on our border policies to implement measures to ensure individuals enter the country legally, safeguarding national interests and sovereignty.\n\nWhat would you change about the US’ response to climate change, if anything?\n\nI advocate for withdrawing from the Paris Accord, emphasizing divine control over Earth's phenomena. Volcanic emissions surpass car exhaust annually. The Accord, seemingly aimed at taxing citizens, opposes my stance against tax hike.\n\nDo you feel confident that the 2024 election will be held securely and fairly? If not, what are your concerns?\n\nI have major concerns about the 2024 election's fairness. To enhance security, I propose a four-day voting period, Saturday through Tuesday, with no computerized tabulation. We must ensure registered voters are U.S. citizens, verified by IDs with pictures and signatures at polling stations. Mail-in ballots should be by request and signature and a copy of the DL should be placed inside the envelope, and paper ballots must be hand-counted at precincts. Results should be promptly available the next day.\n\nPlease take this opportunity to mention any other important issue you’dlike to discuss.\n\nI'm increasingly worried about U.S. funds sent abroad.

He has turned around the Department of Education, purging it of its previous promotion of transgender, CRT, and other scientifically dubious theories and ideologies.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to make life more affordable for ordinary Arizonans?\n\nU.S. Congress can ensure that the federal government respects states' rights and autonomy by not meddling in individual states' affairs. The federal government is only meant to deal with interstate affairs.\n\nWhat specific actions, if any, should Congress take to reform federal immigration policy?\n\nThe federal government should allow states to protect themselves against the invasion of foreigners.\n\nWhat do you believe is the biggest threat to national security, and how should we handle it?\n\nThe U.S.'s policing of the world, toxic relationship with the State of Israel, and funding of the wars in Ukraine and elsewhere. We have domestic issues that need to be addressed first.\n\nWhat would you change about the US’ response to climate change, if anything?\n\n\"Climate change\" is a leftist, globalist ideology. We need to be \"America first.\"\n\nWhen it comes to energy, nuclear is by far the best, most efficient, environmentally friendly renewable source of energy currently available. Arizona could achieve complete electricity independence with micro nuclear reactors using uranium mined in Arizona.\n\nDo you feel confident that the 2024 election will be held securely and fairly?

Its leaders must navigate a housing crisis, rapid population growth and unfounded election conspiracies, among other issues.\n\nIn District 2, two Republicans are running for the job: Incumbent Tom Galvin and former state Rep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita. Whoever wins will face Scottsdale Unified Governing Board member Julie Cieniawski, a Democrat, in the November election.\n\nWhich district do you live in? Check with county maps.\n\nCieniawski is looking to flip the seat — but that will be an uphill battle in the bright-red district. Galvin hopes to win a second term after being appointed to his seat in 2021 and winning election in 2022.\n\nThe Arizona Republic asked each candidate questions about their bid for office and how they would handle key issues if elected. Here's what the candidates had to say. Answers may have been slightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nBudgeting: Where would you increase or decrease county spending?\n\nOne of the primary responsibilities of the Board of Supervisors is to control the county’s checkbook. What areas of county government would you prioritize in your ideal county budget? Would you decrease spending in any areas?\n\nTom Galvin: My core philosophy as a county supervisor is to protect the Maricopa County taxpayers. The board approves the budget for about fifty departments. But, nearly half of the county budget is dedicated to public safety which includes the Sheriff's Office, County Attorney's Office, jails and courts. Public safety funding is my top priority. I have worked with the sheriff and county attorney to assess what’s needed to fight crime and keep residents safe. Drugs are a scourge in our community and Joe Biden’s failure to control the border impacts all of us. I’m proud of investing in the “Focus on Fentanyl” program and the “Organized Retail Theft Task Force” for the County Attorney’s Office. We have provided significant funding to the Sheriff’s Office for drug interdiction.\n\nI’m proud to have voted to cut property tax rates in each of the three budgets I have voted on. In my first year, I passed the largest property tax rate cut in county history. Last month, the county cut the overall budget by 11%. The county’s financial position is strong, without debt. I have earned every police endorsement, including the Mesa Police Association, Arizona State Troopers, Arizona Police Association, and Phoenix Law Enforcement Association.\n\nMichelle Ugenti-Rita: Years of fiscal irresponsibility have resulted in a bloated county budget of $3.87 billion and a bureaucracy of more than 13,000 employees. As a staunch fiscal conservative, with the record to prove it, all of the more than 40 county departments' budgets need to be scrutinized using zero-based budgeting. The era for signing the blank checks requested by the bureaucracy needs to come to an end.\n\nJulie Cieniawski: Priorities for any organization should be indicative through the allocation of resources. Fulfilling the fiduciary responsibilities includes the duty to stay objective, responsible, honest, trustworthy and efficient. Before judgments are made supporting or refuting current expenditures, it's important to understand the progress made on county strategic priorities, the adjustments and costs invested into current priorities and learn more about the recommendations by experts in the field of how to best achieve county goals while maintaining the collective budget. Adjustments should be made according to progress on the priority work and interest and feedback from the people directly impacted by the decisions.\n\nGrowth: How would you address continued population increases?\n\nIn recent years, Maricopa County has continued to experience rapid growth. That has tested the region’s roads, increased concerns about water supply and led to overcrowding in county animal shelters, among other issues. How would you position and prepare the county to navigate the ongoing influx of new residents?\n\nGalvin: People are moving here because Maricopa County has a low tax rate, is favorable for job creation and is dedicated to improving the quality of life of residents. However, this growth means that we need to avoid becoming victims of our success. I have years of experience in the private sector, and I understand how important it is for elected officials to appreciate the concerns and worries of families and business owners. We need to build new roads to meet the demands of our growing economy. However, we need to maintain the roads that we already use every day for work, school and shopping. There is currently a sales tax to fund these roads which has been in place for 40 years.\n\nI support continuing that common-sense financing plan. However, my opponent Michelle Ugenti-Rita opposes the continuance of the financing for the maintenance and construction of roads. This suggests she supports an anti-car agenda and deterioration of our roads, which will lead to further development of light rail and will spur an increase in property taxes to fund it.\n\nI am also proud to have overseen the successful completion of a new animal adoption shelter in Mesa.\n\nWater wars:What happened in Rio Verde Foothills?\n\nUgenti-Rita: Under my opponent Supervisor Thomas Galvin’s failed leadership, the necessary work to properly prepare for Maricopa County’s anticipated population growth hasn’t been done, placing us significantly behind the curve. For example, my opponent abandoned the residents of rapidly growing Rio Verde Foothills last year when they were in dire need of securing a permanent water source, forcing the Arizona Legislature to get involved.\n\nAs an experienced conservative leader, one of my primary goals is to make sure the 10-year and 20-year plans for Maricopa County cannot only accommodate growth, but are financially viable to implement without excessively growing the bureaucracy and tax burden. I strongly oppose raising taxes to fund projects under the guise of “economic development.” That’s what Democrats do — for example, \"Build Back Better,\" also known as \"Build Back Broke.\"\n\nUnlike my opponent, Supervisor Galvin, I do not support Proposition 479, the county’s half-cent sales tax increase, which will generate $15 billion to fund light-rail expansion, mass transit, replacing car lanes with bike lanes, vanpool and dial-a-ride services. Instead, I believe cutting government red tape and getting out of the way of private innovation are important components to preparing Maricopa County’s future for our children and their children.\n\nCieniawski: I think it is vital for a booming county to make aggregate forecasts and predictive models to measure growth, determine the impact on assorted service models and systems, and attempt to hold a proactive approach to planning for rapid growth. Conducting surveys, getting out in the community and learning of the perceived issues from those impacted by decisions is a great way to monitor and adjust plans accordingly.\n\nHousing: How would you work to address the Valley's housing crisis?\n\nAffordable housing is a challenge facing the entire region. If elected, how would you approach this issue in your district and countywide?\n\nGalvin: Maricopa County has planning and zoning jurisdiction over unincorporated areas. However, I have found it important to foster good relations with Mesa, Scottsdale and Phoenix officials regarding housing issues. Joe Biden’s failed inflationary and economic policies are making it difficult for families to buy a home. At Maricopa County, we work with local organizations to help those in need. I’m proud of our collaboration with St. Vincent de Paul to create a facility that now offers beds for 100 veterans, seniors and adults with disabilities.\n\nWater is a crucial part of the housing story. Unlike cities and private water companies, Maricopa County does not provide water. But I believe a county supervisor must advocate to protect our water supply. I’ve only served in elected office for two years, but I successfully mediated the water dispute between the city of Scottsdale and Rio Verde Foothills.\n\nHowever, my opponent Michelle Ugenti-Rita showed no interest in water during her many years in elected office and ignored the Scottsdale water situation throughout her entire 12 years at the state Legislature. I have had extensive discussions about housing with the leading realtor organizations. I am proud to be endorsed by Phoenix Realtors, Scottsdale Area Realtors and the Southeast Valley Realtors.\n\nUgenti-Rita: Arizona as a whole, and Maricopa County in particular, has very little developable private land available. In fact, only 18% of all land in Arizona is privately owned, leaving very few options to accommodate growth. I will use the partnerships I have cultivated and maintained during my 12 years in the Arizona House and Senate to develop regional solutions to this growing problem, unlike my opponent, whose leadership style on issues like the Rio Verde Foothills water crisis resulted in acrimonious relationships with state and local leaders.\n\nCieniawski: It's important to understand that the housing market has shifted dramatically in some municipalities throughout the county. Several factors have led to the affordability crisis. Supply and demand remain a constant factor, other factors influencing the housing affordability issue include: Wages not commensurate with cost of living expenses, entry-level purchasing qualifications being skewed, financing being more challenging to obtain and higher lending interest rates. With homes now being situated to compete with hotels in the tourism industry, it's no wonder affordability issues continue to plague parts of our county.\n\nThe solutions are not easy and will require the commitment of many different resources in our community (and nation) to properly address. As projects are considered and onboarded, the county can implement enhanced qualifying standards which can alter the results of new housing projects and how they impact affordability, footprint, ecological impact, sustainability and adaptability to various populations (old, young, singles, families, multi-generational, etc.). The input from industry experts and affected community members, examining other county solutions and encouraging creativity can support solutions to alleviate housing affordability challenges.\n\nGovernment relations: How will you work with state lawmakers and others to address issues facing the county?\n\nCounties are arms of the state and have only specific powers prescribed in Arizona law. If elected, how would you lobby state lawmakers and other officials to address issues facing the county? Would you advocate for increased powers at the county level — and if so, what ones?\n\nGalvin: ​​I am a strong proponent of limited government, and I would not advocate for “increased powers” at the county level. We counties are mandated by state law to carry out executive functions provided by state law and the Arizona Constitution.\n\nHowever, there are important issues where we need to collaborate with the Legislature. I do believe that state officials have neglected the important issue of election integrity. Gov. Katie Hobbs did not even mention elections once in this year’s State of the State speech. The rest of the nation wonders why Arizona has procedures that do not speed up vote counting.\n\nI plan to call on state lawmakers to catch up to the 21st century by delivering reforms to the voters who desire stronger election procedures. I hear often from local law enforcement officials about how the border crisis is detrimentally impacting Maricopa County. I want to work with state lawmakers to increase penalties for those who bring illicit fentanyl over the border. I want to continue working with state lawmakers on securing our water supply. I have extensive experience in water issues, and it is extremely important that we promote conservation, augmentation and reuse for the next hundred years.\n\nUgenti-Rita: Many people may not be aware, but one of the powers of the Board of Supervisors is to appoint members to the Arizona Legislature in the event that a vacancy occurs. Mr. Galvin took full advantage of this power and appointed Jevin Hodge, a radical Democrat, to fill a vacant seat in Legislative District 8 earlier this year. This suggests Supervisor Galvin chose Mr. Hodge, Congressman David Schweikert's 2022 Democratic election opponent, in a retaliatory move against the congressman because of his vocal support of my candidacy for the Board of Supervisors.\n\nSupervisor Galvin praised Mr. Hodge in a press release, saying: \"Jevin Hodge has proven himself to be an independent thinker and business advocate who puts community wellbeing ahead of politics.\" Supervisor Galvin went on to say: “I appreciated his thoughtful answers to my questionnaire, and I believe he will be a voice of reason and a potential consensus builder at the state Capitol.\" It is important to note, Mr. Hodge resigned 48 days after his appointment by the county supervisors when serious allegations in his past were discovered.\n\nCieniawski: I think no matter what position of authority one is assigned to, it is important to work collaboratively with others, when possible. County leaders should be coordinating efforts with municipalities and state leaders. This collaborative approach to addressing the needs of the residents in Maricopa County can extend resources and direct priorities to receive the best return on investment and collectively support the needs of the residents in Maricopa County and across the state of Arizona.\n\nElections: How confident are you in election results?\n\nMaricopa County supervisors are responsible for overseeing Election Day voting, running tabulation and certifying election results. The county also saw widespread printer issues during the 2022 election, although they did not impact the outcome. How confident are you in the certified results of the 2020 and 2022 elections? Regardless of your answer, how would you work to improve voting and election administration in the county?\n\nGalvin: I have worked every day for the last two years on improving voting and election procedures. It is important to look forward and always find ways for improvement. I have voted to approve the construction of a new election facility. I have approved increases of the following: Signature verifier teams, number of tabulators, full-time election staff and number of voting locations.\n\nThis year, I advocated for the passage of an important bill to ensure that military and overseas voters are not disenfranchised. My opponent Michelle Ugenti-Rita said of military voters who were concerned about not being able to vote in a post on X: “There’s not a problem. Get over it!” Indeed, there was a problem. The conservative Republican-led Legislature passed the bill and Gov. Hobbs signed it. I am proud of fighting for military voters.\n\nI am confident of the certified results of the 2020 and 2022 elections. I have never wavered from that assessment. I know many career politicians, including my opponent Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who have refused to answer this important question. A county supervisor is tasked with certifying elections so one must have the courage and political backbone to be candid with the voters of District 2.\n\nUgenti-Rita: Since I was elected in 2010, I have been a leader of reforming our election system. I have championed several reforms to protect the integrity of our elections by banning the practice of ballot harvesting, consolidating election dates, strengthening our voter identification laws, cleaning up our vote-by-mail rolls and strengthening the process for automatic recount when races are razor close.\n\nI am not confident in the result of the past several elections due to the county’s negligence in the administration of our elections. From the countless meetings and events I have attended during this campaign, what is abundantly clear is neither is the public. Voters are tired of having their concerns ignored and my opponent's absence and refusal to participate in any of these forums only furthers their distrust in our election process. Voters feel intimidated by the county’s new mandatory police escorts they must have when speaking at board meetings and feel disenfranchised by their government and current Supervisor Thomas Galvin.\n\nCieniawski: It's vital to uphold high standards of administrative leadership and collaboration commitment throughout the voting process. Systems need to be clearly communicated and implemented while remaining open to feedback from assorted sources that are meaningful and ultimately create systemic improvements. This can be completed in the way of data analysis, direct feedback from assorted user perspectives (through surveys), audit actions and the analysis of data.\n\nThe cog of change must include data-driven and factual information as well as an understanding of the user experience and the will to implement the change. It is interesting that the claims of alleged tainted election outcomes came from candidates in an election where others from the same political party emerged victorious in other races. I accepted the outcome of the elections because it is what adult citizens should do. It's important to accept defeat and success with grace.\n\nOn a personal note: Who do you admire?\n\nWhat person in public life, past or present, do you most admire, and why?\n\nGalvin: First, my parents and my wife have made the most tremendous impact on my life. My parents taught me about hard work, and love of family, and instilled in me a faith in God. My wife inspires me every day as we raise our young son.\n\nThere are two public figures that I admire: President Ronald Reagan and former Gov. Jan Brewer. President Reagan won two landslide elections because he understood the American people. He advocated for issues and policies that are timeless. He triumphed at a time when Americans were tired of rising crime and rising inflation, the same issues we see today. Reagan’s policies of cutting taxes and addressing crime were meant to help folks who needed it. I am now cutting taxes and investing in public safety to ensure Maricopa County residents can thrive and are safe.\n\nMy opponent Michelle Ugenti-Rita has posted nasty comments about fellow Republicans such as Donald Trump and Kari Lake on X, rather than focusing on policy differences. I prefer to emulate Jan Brewer, who doesn’t bash fellow Republicans but cheers them on. Brewer is a conservative who sticks to her guns and stays true to her principles. I am honored to be endorsed by her.\n\nUgenti-Rita: In public life, I most admire people who stand for and defend conservative values and principles without equivocation. That is why I am proud to be endorsed by U.S. Congressman David Schweikert, former Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Abe Hamedeh, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Secretary of State Republican nominee Mark Finchem and Scottsdale Vice Mayor Barry Graham. I am also endorsed by 11 current and former state legislators, including state Sen. Wendy Rogers, state Rep. Joe Chaplik and state Rep. Barbra Parker. This is an unprecedented rebuke of current Supervisor Thomas Galvin's failed leadership.\n\nCieniawski: There are many individuals who I admire and who have provided me with inspiration. Women like Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Billie Jean King, Shirley Chisholm and Malala Yousafzai all overcame discriminative stereotypes and continued to move their interests forward despite great odds and consequences.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/01/20/usa-today-contributors-bidens-first-100-days-column/4216744001/", "title": "What does Joe Biden need to get done in his first 100 days?", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nOpinion columnists\n\nThe USA TODAY Opinion section asked members of our Board of Contributors, \"What is the most critical priority for President Joe Biden to succeed on in his first 100 days?\"\n\nBiden doesn't need to act, he needs to listen\n\nThe most important thing that President Biden can do in his first 100 days is listen. It’s the most important form of communication — and the least utilized one, especially by politicians. It’s also a good way to get informed, defuse tension and disarm critics. While many of those who run for president boast that they will know how to do the job on Day One, that is rarely true. Biden starts with a sizable advantage over others who have stepped into the job because he was vice president just four years ago. But a lot has happened in the past four years to knock the government off its game. Biden will need time to survey the landscape, post-Trump. Listening — particularly to critics — will also help Biden calm the country’s anxieties. Trump supporters are worked up something fierce at the moment because they feel no one hears them or cares about their concerns. Giving them a hearing will take the steam from their engines. They expect to be ignored. Biden mustn’t give them the satisfaction. President Biden will have plenty of time to get things done. But listening will teach him what needs doing and how to do it.\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr. is a syndicated columnist and founder of the Navarrette Sonic Podcast Network.

In the race to get 100 million shots into 100 million arms in the first 100 days, the administration must redouble its commitment to racial and economic justice, learn from past failures, and respond to bottlenecks with lightning-fast precision to ensure vaccination efforts don’t devolve further into a chaotic free-for-all that reach only a privileged few. Getting a shot in most of the country resembles something like a rush for coveted concert tickets in pre-pandemic days. But this vaccine “golden ticket” could save your life. The botched rollout has seniors lining up at health departments and scouring the Internet for scarce appointments. It’s easy to see who’s going to be left behind in this mad scramble: those who lack access to technology and transportation, who live with disabilities and in “pharmacy deserts,” who don’t speak English and who need trusted information about vaccine safety. The pandemic has exposed America’s festering inequality and cracks in our crumbling public health infrastructure. If we have any hope of ending this crisis, Biden’s plan must ensure equitable vaccine access and reach long-neglected communities of color who have borne the pandemic’s disproportionate suffering and death.\n\nStacy Torres is an assistant professor of sociology in the Department of Social Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nPass the COVID-19 relief package\n\nRarely has any president had to attack so many equally urgent problems on Day One: pandemic, political upheaval and economic meltdown. But if forced to choose the single initiative in which Biden must succeed, it would be his proposed rescue package. Not necessarily the full $1.9 trillion proposal, but two essential elements of it. First, the $1,400 stipend. We are in a crisis of epic proportions, with raging unemployment and more than 25 million Americans who don’t have enough to eat, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Second, the measures that most impact women, including support for child care and paid family and sick leave. The coronavirus economic fallout has hit women far harder than men — there’s a reason it’s called a “shecession” — and people of color far harder than whites. In December, women accounted for 100% of the net loss of 140,000 jobs, most of them women of color, who disproportionately work in areas like hospitality and retail. We can’t recover from the pandemic if we leave half of the population behind.\n\nJoanne Lipman, the Distinguished Journalism Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, is author of \"That's What She Said: What Men and Women Need to Know About Working Together.\" She is a former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY.

America has another critical issue that is being used by our adversaries to tear us apart. That issue is racism. The major issues facing this country — the coronavirus pandemic, health care, the economy, criminal and justice reform, and domestic terrorism — all intersect with racism, which makes those issues particularly daunting. Loving a country that continues to grapple with racism is like loving a father who continually disappoints you. As I loved my father, I also continue to love my country. I pay my taxes, I work hard to support my family and I vote. I am fully an American citizen and a patriot. I am also fully a Black woman. I am painfully aware that in spite of the progress and promises, my race dictates to many how I should be viewed and treated. Addressing the country’s problems with racism will not be an easy fix, but acknowledging it as a problem is the first step toward change.\n\nNjeri Mathis Rutledge is a professor of law at South Texas College of Law Houston and a former prosecuting attorney. Follow her on Twitter: @NjeriRutledge\n\nBuild a humble yet ambitious foreign policy\n\nCOVID-19 has forced the United States to realign its foreign policy priorities. It’s not simply enough for Biden to rejoin a few treaties and alliances and dial the clock back to 2016. The world’s balance of power is profoundly different, and so he needs to dial back American expectations and recalibrate U.S. strategic priorities going forward. He needs to put forth a new foreign policy that is more humble yet not throw away the proverbial baby with the bath water when it comes to jettisoning Donald Trump’s policies. Biden should double down on Trump’s cajoling of allies to pay their fair share of collective defense. He should keep pressure on China to be a responsible stakeholder in international institutions while respecting its neighbors’ territorial rights, intellectual property of businesses, and human rights of its various ethnic minorities and of Hong Kong citizens. At the same time, the new president must not allow the gravitational pull of so-called great power competition to drain all the oxygen out of other U.S. priorities and threats, or in becoming a self-fulfilled prophecy. China’s rise will be competitive but peaceful. Biden should order a top-down review of whether our defense priorities are being met by our whopping $700 billion budget and look to slash programs that are either misaligned, wasteful or needlessly bureaucratic (beginning with a serious rethink of Trump’s quixotic fascination with a Space Force). More money and resources should flow from the Pentagon toward the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (and the United Nations), so that the face of U.S. foreign policy is no longer one in head-to-toe fatigues. That will allow us to face the real threat of climate change and potential future pandemics more adroitly. He should also commission a task force to study civil-military relations to think through the ramifications of what a smaller military will do for the American psyche and position in the world, as well as a thorough investigation of the presence of hate groups within its ranks. America cannot rot from within if it is to project strength and confidence overseas. Yet nor should we fool ourselves that we will no longer be fighting Vietnam-style wars as the ascendancy of middle powers — the Turkeys and Ethiopias and Irans of the world — and their jostling for regional primacy will inevitably suck in American troops, like it or not. That is what a system of unbalanced multipolarity, as politics scientists call it, looks like. Trouble is, without strong leadership like a Bismarck or a Merkel at the helm, or without a rejuvenated fleet of foreign service officers to put out brush fires preventatively before their spread, these types of systems are typically unstable and can lead to war. Biden has the unfortunate task of thinking bold while midwifing an America that is more humble and no longer the world’s sole superpower or policeman. Expect turbulent times ahead.\n\nLionel Beehner is co-editor of \"Reconsidering American Civil-Military Relations: The Military, Society, Politics, and Modern War.\" He is formerly an assistant professor at West Point.\n\nReach out to Trump voters\n\nBiden assumes the presidency under the most fraught conditions in American history. America’s influence in the world is at an all-time low. The economy is teetering. The pandemic is out of control and could end up killing as many Americans as all the wars in the 20th century, combined. But the worst problem President Biden faces is this: In a recent poll, 54% of Americans said that the biggest threat to America’s way of life is “other people in America.” That isn’t sustainable. To succeed, Biden needs to persuade the more than 74 million Americans who didn’t vote for him — over 50 million of whom still don’t believe he won — to give him a fair shake. That isn’t going to be easy, and it’s no use just expecting them to fall in line. He needs to speak to these people directly and ask them, as fellow Americans who love their country, to put aside their differences for six months and work with him to beat the coronavirus, get everyone vaccinated and stabilize the economy. Making speeches isn’t going to help heal America’s wounds, whether they are racial, political or social, but working together and succeeding just might.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is a legal adviser for The Guardrails of Democracy Project and CEO of CertifiedVoter.com.\n\nActually be a moderate\n\nAmericans are violently divided, as shown by the protesters who stormed the U.S. Capitol and the riots that spread destruction across the country last year. To unify a seething nation, Biden needs to chart a moderate course during his first 100 days in the White House. “Unity is not some pie-in-the-sky dream. It’s a practical step to getting things done,” he stated last week. Thus far, however, Democrats sound more committed to retribution and pursuing a radically leftist agenda than bringing people together. According to Politico, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “Expulsion should be on the table,” about removing congressional Republicans for supporting President Trump’s efforts to decertify the election. Other Democrats want to bar Trump-supporting conservatives from being able to co-sponsor any legislation during the incoming 117th Congress. On top of such revenge plots is a Democratic agenda on federal deficit spending, tax increases, immigration, the \"Green New Deal,\" gun control, student-loan debt forgiveness and abortion that is neither bipartisan nor unifying. Biden needs to step back from the ledge and reach out to the middle to show that he believes unity is not a pie-in-the-sky dream, and that he really wants to represent all Americans.\n\nBrett M.

Bush take the oath of office, becoming the 41st president of the United States. Thousands sat with me, shoulder to shoulder. The Capitol was not an armed fortress then, no razor wire or nonscalable fencing. Peace and order reigned. I remember feeling an unexpected rush of emotion as President Bush recited the oath — and with that sudden rush came quiet tears of hope and pride. I watched with the world as he declared, aloud, that his very first act as president would be a prayer. And then he prayed. His first prayer: “Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank you for your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do your work, willing to heed and hear your will and write on our hearts these words — ‘Use power to help people.’ For we are given power not to advance our own purposes nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us remember it, Lord. Amen.” Straight out of the gate, he declared his intention — “My first act as president is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads” — followed by the prayer itself, and from that moment forward he led the nation with a strong, caring hand. Faith and works.\n\nIn his first 100 days as president, Biden must work to unify and heal this nation. He must assume the role of chief architect for a vaccine rollout that will be organized and efficient. He must throw all of his energy into containing COVID-19 and halting these needless deaths. He must make the moves that will repair and stimulate this gutted economy. He must put this nation on a path toward social and racial justice. He must restore public trust. We are a nation in crisis and confusion. From the first moment of the first day of his presidency and for all of his days in office thereafter, Biden must assume a bold, bipartisan, boots-on-the-ground sensibility that places all of us at the same starting line together, ready to run this new race and win it. It is our race to win or our race to lose.\n\nLord knows there’s lots of work to be done, and plenty to prioritize. But before Biden unfurls that oh-so-very-long laundry list, I am hoping — and hopeful — that he will begin his presidency with a prayer. Straight out of the gate. It has been done before. Begin with a payer. Then get to work. In that order.\n\nKristin Clark Taylor is an author, editor and journalist. She served as White House director of media relations under President George H.W.

The attorney general’s office combed through emails and 600 of Hubbard’s phone calls from prison and cited some of the conversations as they oppose his request for early release from prison. State attorneys said the communications show he was “not truthful” when he signed a letter apologizing for his 2016 conviction for violating state ethics law, including using his public office for personal financial gain. Hubbard submitted the letter – in which he said that “I recognize and admit my errors” – in September along with a request for early release from prison. He wrote that his conviction embarrassed the state and his family and that “for this, I am severely sorry and respectfully ask forgiveness from everyone affected.” According to the Monday court filing, Hubbard told a friend before submitting the apology letter that “I promise you I did nothing wrong.” Prosecutors said Hubbard also talked to friends about efforts to add language to community corrections legislation that could benefit his release.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fast-growing area north of Anchorage known as a hotbed of conservatism gained the most population since the 2010 census and will keep the same number of seats in the Legislature under a new map of state political boundaries that some critics say shortchanges the area. It’s not the only criticism of the plan approved by a divided state Redistricting Board, and court challenges are expected. Among the criticisms are House district pairings for Senate seats for the Anchorage and Eagle River areas that board member Nicole Borromeo said would open the board to “an unfortunate and very easily winnable argument of partisan gerrymandering.” Census data showed the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which is about the size of West Virginia and includes Palmer and former Gov. Sarah Palin’s hometown of Wasilla north of Anchorage, had 18,086 more people last year than in 2010, the biggest jump for any borough or census area in Alaska. The region also was the second most populous overall in the state, with an estimated 107,081 people, behind Anchorage, with 291,247, according to census data. While the region would have the same number of seats, new House maps would place two Wasilla incumbents in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s corrections chief says incarcerated people often have greater access to health services than people who aren’t locked up. Corrections Director David Shinn’s defense of the health care system for inmates came as he testified at a trial about the quality of medical and mental health care in state prisons, after the state has faced years of complaints and been fined $2.5 million for not complying with a settlement over the issue. A judge who threw the settlement out this summer concluded that the state showed little interest in making many improvements it promised under the 6-year-old deal and that inadequate care for prisoners had led to suffering and preventable deaths. “They often have greater access to care than I do as a private citizen,” Shinn said of people behind bars. Lawyers for the inmates are asking U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver to take over health care operations in state-run prisons, appoint an official to run medical and mental health services there, ensure prisons have enough health care workers, and reduce the use of isolation cells, including banning their use for prisoners under age 18 or those with serious mental illnesses. They say Arizona’s prison health care operations are understaffed and poorly supervised, routinely deny access to necessary medications, fail to provide adequate pain management for end-stage cancer patients and others, and don’t meet the minimum standards for mental health care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLonoke: A former sheriff’s deputy pleaded not guilty Monday in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of civil rights activists. Michael Davis entered the plea to a felony count of manslaughter in the June 23 shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Davis shot Brittain during a traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis was charged in September in Brittain’s death. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to Davis’ arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands, according to the affidavit. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Staples Center is getting a new name. Starting Christmas Day, it will be Crypto.com Arena. The downtown Los Angeles home of the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers, the NHL’s Kings and the WNBA’s Sparks will change its name after 22 years of operation, arena owner AEG announced Tuesday night. A person with knowledge of the deal said Crypto.com is paying $700 million over 20 years to rename the building. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the parties aren’t publicly announcing the terms of what’s believed to be the richest naming rights deal in sports history. The 20,000-seat arena has been the Staples Center since it opened in October 1999, with the naming rights owned by the American office-supplies retail company under a 20-year agreement. The name will change when the Lakers host the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA’s annual Christmas showcase. Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency platform and exchange headquartered in Singapore. Along with its sports tenants, the arena has hosted 19 Grammy Awards ceremonies, three NBA All-Star Games, two NHL All-Star Games, and countless high-profile concerts, performances and important public events, including memorials for Michael Jackson, Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant. The Lakers have won six NBA championships during their tenure in the cavernous arena.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A suburban Denver police department has agreed to reforms after the killing of Elijah McClain led to indictments against officers and a first-of-its-kind civil rights investigation that found a pattern of racially biased policing and excessive force. The plan, announced Tuesday by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Aurora’s city manager, police chief and fire chief, was reached in response to a civil rights investigation launched by Weiser amid outrage over the death of McClain, a Black man who was put into a chokehold by police and injected with ketamine by paramedics in 2019. The proposal calls for the city to revamp its use-of-force policies and launch new training programs in an effort to combat bias in the ranks. Another key goal of the agreement is eliminating unnecessary use of force and increasing tracking and transparency about how officers engage with the community, Weiser said. It also aims to create a more diverse workforce in the police and fire departments. Aurora city officials said they are on board with the plan, which also includes the city’s fire department. It still hinges on City Council approval. “We are not going to shy away from reform,” Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said. “To the officers on the street, this consent decree is nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Seven women who say they suffered excruciating pain after a nurse stole fentanyl for her personal use and replaced it with saline sued Yale University on Wednesday, alleging it failed to safeguard its supply of the painkilling opioid at a fertility clinic. The women say they underwent painful and invasive procedures for in vitro fertilization and were supposed to receive fentanyl at the Yale University Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic in Orange, Connecticut, last year. Unbeknownst to them, they received saline instead of fentanyl, and when they told staff of their extreme pain during and after the procedures, their concerns were dismissed, according to the lawsuit filed in state court in Waterbury by the women and their spouses. “Yale’s failure to develop and implement safety measures mandated by state and federal law to secure drugs like fentanyl resulted in these patients being traumatized,” Joshua Koskoff, a lawyer for the women, said in a statement. “What should have been a time of hope for these women and their families became one of unimaginable suffering.” Yale spokesperson Karen Peart Peart said university officials will not comment on the lawsuit, which seeks undisclosed damages.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A fledgling nonprofit’s efforts to address homelessness with temporary shelter villages are progressing in Sussex County and could become a statewide solution. “Our vision is to build across state,” said Judson Malone, Springboard Collaborative co-founder and director. “We think we have a provable model that actually has a solution to homelessness.” The Georgetown Town Council passed a resolution Oct. 27 allowing Springboard to build and manage a temporary shelter village, similar to a tiny home village. Conley’s Church, in the Angola area of Lewes, has offered its property for a second such site. Springboard will use shelters designed by an Everett, Washington, company called Pallet, named for how the shelters are shipped. They’re framed with aluminum, and the panels are made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic with a foam-insulating core, according to the company’s website. Like traditional houses, Pallet shelters are temperature-controlled, weather-resistant and lockable, but they can be assembled in less than an hour and cost as low as $5,500. They’re not quite tiny houses, though. Pallet shelters do not have plumbing, kitchens or bathrooms, as they’re meant to be temporary shelters. In typical Pallet villages, there are shared bathhouses, laundry facilities and eating areas.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After 34 days of protest at the Blackburn University Center, Howard University students have reached an agreement with the school, ending their weeks­long sit-in demonstration, WUSA-TV reports. “Howard University is pleased to announce that we have come to an agreement with the students who occupied Blackburn,” university President Wayne Frederick wrote in a statement released on Twitter and Youtube. “The health and well-being of our students is the most important part of my job as president. As I have said before, even one issue in one of our dormitories is too many, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our pledge to maintain safe and high-end housing.” Frederick’s statement also referenced the 2020 campus master plan, promising to “grow and invest in our beloved Hilltop” and to share more details soon of his plans to bring the campus back together following this division. Dozens of Howard University students had occupied the Blackburn University Center for weeks, setting up and living out of tents to bring attention to several issues, including living conditions in their dorm rooms, as they claim some were found to have mold. They also wanted student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 1,000 manatees have died in the state so far this year, eclipsing a previous annual record as the threatened marine mammals struggle with starvation due to pollution in the water. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported the updated total Wednesday. The 1,003 manatee deaths so far in 2021 are many more than the 637 recorded last year and well above the previous mark of 830 set in 2013. Slow-moving, bulky manatees have long struggled to coexist with humans. Boat strikes account for some deaths and many injuries. But state officials and environmental groups say polluted water runoff from agriculture, sewage and other man-made development has caused algae blooms in estuaries, choking off the seagrass upon which manatees rely. Climate change is worsening the problem. Authorities expected another bad year for manatees, with more deaths to come as Florida enters the winter months, when the animals congregate in warm-water areas where food supplies have dwindled. Seagrass beds on the state’s eastern coast have been hit especially hard. To compound the problem, manatees are slow to reproduce. According to the nonprofit Save the Manatee Club – co-founded by Florida troubadour Jimmy Buffet – one calf is born every two to five years after a manatee reaches sexual maturity at about age 5. Twin births are rare.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Scores of housing activists, tenants and lawmakers rallied Tuesday to pressure officials to speed up the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid aimed at preventing evictions in the state. Congress set aside nearly $1 billion in funding for Georgia to help tenants pay past-due rent and utility bills during the pandemic, but the state has struggled to get the money out. Georgia had distributed less than 10% of the first set of funds by the end of September, according to a report last week by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The report singled out Georgia, Ohio, Arizona and Tennessee for their slow disbursement of aid and large populations of renters. At Tuesday’s rally in downtown Atlanta, Lajoycelyn Bowles, 43, said she has repeatedly contacted the Georgia Department of Community Affairs – the state agency administering Georgia’s funds – but has never heard back. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in August and has been too sick to work. She received an eviction notice this week from her landlord in Lithonia. “I’m frustrated and pissed off,” she said. The Department of Community Affairs said in a statement that it has distributed $44.2 million to more than 6,900 tenants and landlords so far. It has also added staff and extended working hours to handle an increase in applications.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state ranks last in the nation for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, according to a new study from the American Lung Association. Just 2.8% of high-risk smokers in Hawaii undergo annual CT scans that capture detailed pictures of the lungs, compared to 5.7% nationally, the study said. A state-by-state analysis also found that just 19% of lung cancer cases in Hawaii are diagnosed early, compared to 24.5% nationally, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that smokers and former smokers who are at high risk of developing lung cancer undergo the CT scans. The high-risk category includes adults between the ages of 55 and 80 who smoke a pack a day or more and former heavy smokers who quit in the past 15 years. The annual screenings are limited to the highest-risk smokers, in part due to the risk of false positive results, which can cause anxiety and lead to follow-up tests and procedures that aren’t needed and carry their own risk. Detecting lung cancer early can dramatically improve the chances of successfully treating it. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed early is 60%. The survival rate drops to 6% when spotted at a late stage. The study found that Native Hawaiians are more likely to be diagnosed and die of lung cancer than other ethnic groups.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill making it easier for residents to get worker compensation if they become ill after taking an employee-mandated vaccine sailed through the state House and headed for the Senate on Tuesday. The measure passed the House on a 67-3 vote. It was among seven COVID-19-related bills the chamber pushed through with expedited voting and sent to the Senate. Supporters said workers are getting sick after being vaccinated against COVID-19, and some are having problems receiving compensation. The bill tilts the field toward employees for compensation of hard-to-prove claims such as illnesses caused by vaccines, backers said. “If the employer is telling you, ‘You have to do this in order to work here,’ if they’re doing that, then, by golly, I think our system ought to provide a fair compensation method,” Democratic Rep. John Gannon said. Bill opponents said THAT Idaho’s worker compensation has worked well for decades and that workers sickened by vaccines are already being compensated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines can include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. Also heading to the Senate was a bill that would prohibit questioning the sincerity of people claiming religious exemptions from vaccinations.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday signed a law making voting easier for people with disabilities and creating a group to study removal of further barriers. The law also makes adjustments in deadlines and other technical requirements for candidates in next year’s primary election because it’s later. Pritzker signed a law in June moving the primary from March 15 to June 28 because late-arriving 2020 census numbers delayed the drawing of new congressional district boundaries. Under the law, which takes effect immediately, any polling place that is accessible to voters with disabilities and elderly voters is to include at least one voting booth that is wheelchair-accessible. The Access to Voting for Persons with Disabilities Advisory Task Force will be composed of 15 members, three each appointed by the governor and leaders of the partisan caucuses in House and Senate. The group must meet at least four times and publish its results. Another change allows voters to designate sex on voter registration forms as “male,” “female” or “non-binary.” The measure was sponsored by Senate President Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, and Democratic Rep. Katie Stuart of Edwardsville.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest teachers union is calling on lawmakers to address educator burnout and ongoing teacher shortages during the next legislative session that begins in January. The state is “slowly making progress” on teacher pay, but additional action is needed to attract and retain teachers, Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill said during a news conference Monday. Teacher workload and burnout were already issues before the start of the pandemic, Gambill said, but the onset of the coronavirus has since worsened the teacher shortage. “We are now going into the third consecutive school year impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. “Our educators, already overburdened, are facing unsustainable levels of stress and stress-related illness.” The shortage of teachers – compounded by a substitute shortage – has meant more educators are required to work longer hours without time off or time for classroom planning, Gambill said. For some, he said that has included working 12-plus-hour days on top of second or third jobs. Gambill said educators cite a lack of professional respect as a contributing factor in the lack of teachers. In response, he said the union is calling on the Legislature to restore teachers’ ability to bargain contracts that include health and safety conditions, class sizes and prep periods.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most Iowans support United Auto Workers members over their Deere & Co. bosses in the 10,100-worker strike in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds. About 58% of Iowa adults say they mostly side with Deere workers, compared to just 16% who mostly side with the employers. Another 19% are unsure, and 7% support neither group. With the strike in its fifth week, the UAW announced Friday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Deere. Union members, who have rejected two previous offers, were voting Wednesday on the latest pact. Striking UAW members have a majority or plurality of Iowans’ support regardless of political party, age, gender, educational attainment, religious affiliation, income bracket, or whether they live in a rural or urban area. Selzer & Co. conducted the poll of 810 adults Nov. 7-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Elsie Carroll, 31, a customer service representative in Dubuque who participated in the poll, said she supports the workers because she believes they would sacrifice their paychecks to go on strike only if the company is failing them. UAW members on strike receive $275 a week from the union, far less than what they earn at Deere.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A high-ranking Republican lawmaker who is running for statewide office wants the upcoming special session to put an end to coronavirus contact tracing, calling the practice an invasion of privacy. State Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, made the suggestion to “stop this specific contact tracing” at a Monday meeting of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules and Regulations. The GOP supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature forced Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to call a special session starting Nov. 22. Lawmakers are set to debate proposals on COVID-19 vaccine mandate exemptions and unemployment insurance for unvaccinated workers who lose their jobs, though additional measures could be proposed. Tyson, who is running for state treasurer, said during and after the meeting that she would want legislation removing virus contact tracing language from last session’s appropriations bill. But she demurred on whether she would introduce a bill or an amendment herself. The budget bill granted the Kansas Department of Health and Environment the authority to hire contact tracers and to adopt related regulations. It is unclear whether repealing the contact tracing provision as Tyson proposed would end the practice or remove some of the more arduous rules imposed by the Legislature.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Appalachian Regional Commission has awarded more than $1.5 million in federal funds to five Kentucky projects that aim to address the region’s substance abuse crisis through recovery-to-work programs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The grants announced Tuesday are part of an ARC initiative that focuses on funding efforts that help create recovery-friendly work environments and provide supports to those in recovery and their employers. The projects can also include job training. Since April 2021, ARC has invested $14.9 million in 47 related projects. A request for proposals for a third round of awards will be be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state board granted parole Wednesday to Henry Montgomery, whose Supreme Court case was instrumental in extending the possibility of freedom to hundreds of people sentenced to life in prison without the opportunity for parole when they were juveniles. Montgomery, 75, was convicted in the 1963 killing of Charles Hurt, an East Baton Rouge sheriff’s deputy who caught him skipping school. Montgomery was 17 at the time. He was initially sentenced to death, but the state’s Supreme Court threw out his conviction in 1966, saying he didn’t get a fair trial. The case was retried and Montgomery convicted again, sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He served decades at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. A three-member board voted unanimously in favor of parole. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting was held on Zoom, with Montgomery appearing on camera from the prison where he has spent his entire adult life. “He’s been in prison for 57 years. He has an excellent … disciplinary record. He is a low risk by our assessment. He’s got good comments from the warden. He has a very good prison record,” board member Tony Marabella said as he voted to approve Montgomery’s release with certain conditions, including a curfew and that he have no contact with the victim’s family.\n\nMaine\n\nFreedom: A wayward roadrunner is on the mend in the Pine Tree State after traveling across the country in a moving van. The greater roadrunner, a species native to Southwestern states, hitched a ride in the storage area of a moving van from Las Vegas to Westbrook, Maine. Volunteers took the bird to Avian Haven, a bird rehabilitation facility. Avian Haven representatives said they took the call about the bird Nov. 13, and it continued to rest Tuesday. They said in a Facebook post that the bird was in “remarkably good shape” for having been stuck in a van for four days but might have lost weight during the journey. The center is looking at ways to return the roadrunner to Nevada once it is healthy enough, said Diane Winn, Avian Haven’s executive director. The center has created a special habitat for the bird that is warmer than its typical outdoor areas while also being sufficiently roomy, the group said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A case of monkeypox has been confirmed in a Maryland resident who recently returned from Nigeria, state health officials announced Tuesday. The person had mild symptoms and is recovering in isolation but isn’t hospitalized, the Department of Health said in a news release. The general public doesn’t need to take any special precautions, officials said. People who may have been in contact with the person who was diagnosed with the illness have been identified, and public health authorities are continuing to follow up with them, Deputy Secretary for Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan said in a statement. Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses as smallpox but generally causes a milder infection, officials said. It can be spread through direct contact with lesions or body fluids or via contaminated materials like clothing or large respiratory droplets. Illness typically begins with flu-like symptoms and lymph node swelling and progresses to a rash on the face and body. The people who may have been exposed in this case will be monitored for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Human monkeypox infections primarily occur in central and western African countries and have only rarely been documented outside of Africa.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michelle Wu was sworn in Tuesday as the first woman and first person of color elected mayor in the city’s long history. The swearing-in of Boston’s first Asian American mayor came two weeks after Wu won the election. Before Wu, Boston had elected only white men as mayor. “City government is special. We are the level closest to the people, so we must do the big and the small. Every streetlight, every pothole, every park and classroom lays the foundation for greater change,” Wu said after taking the oath of office. “After all, Boston was founded on a revolutionary promise: that things don’t have to be as they always have been. That we can chart a new path for families now, and for generations to come, grounded in justice and opportunity,” she said. Wu, 36, takes over for a fellow Democrat – former acting Mayor Kim Janey – who was Boston’s first woman and first Black resident to serve in the top post, to which she was not elected. To push back against soaring housing costs that have forced some former residents out of the city, Wu has promised to pursue rent stabilization or rent control. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is the fact that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide. Another of Wu’s top campaign promises is to create a “fare-free” public transit system.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A federal judge retained jurisdiction Tuesday in a dispute over a Canadian oil pipeline that runs through a section of the Great Lakes, rejecting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s contention that the case belongs in state court. The clash over whether Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 should continue operating raises issues “under consideration at the highest levels of this country’s government” involving a U.S.-Canada treaty and federal pipeline safety regulation, U.S. District Judge Janet Neff ruled. The matter “is properly in federal court,” she wrote in a 15-page opinion that drew praise from Enbridge. Whitmer’s office expressed disappointment, and environmentalists ramped up pressure on President Joe Biden to intervene. Line 5 moves 23 million gallons daily of crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, passing through northern Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A 4-mile section is divided into two pipes that cross the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. Whitmer ordered Enbridge last year to close the 68-year-old line, agreeing with Indigenous tribes, environmentalists and tourist businesses that it risks a devastating spill. Enbridge contends the line is safe and ignored the Democratic governor’s May 12 shutdown deadline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Department of Defense will send medical teams to two major hospitals to relieve doctors and nurses who are swamped by a growing wave of COVID-19 patients, Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday. The teams, each comprising 22 people, will arrive at Hennepin County Medical Center and St. Cloud Hospital next week and begin treating patients immediately, Walz said in a conference call from the Finnish capital, Helsinki. the latest stop on his European trade mission. Minnesota has become one of the country’s worst hot spots for new coronavirus infections. Hospital beds are filling up with unvaccinated people, and staffers are being worn down by the surge. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday that she’s ready to expand access to booster vaccines to all adults by the end of the week if the federal government doesn’t act first. “Our best defense against this is the vaccine,” Walz told reporters. He noted that Minnesota is No. 2 in the county for the number of booster shots given, behind only Vermont, and that first doses have risen 60% over the past week. “And we know that that is our way out of this. … I need Minnesotans to recognize, as we’ve been saying, this is a dangerous time.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Saying it could be days before tap water is safe to drink, officials issued a citywide boil-water order the same day the Environmental Protection Agency was in town to tout the newly passed federal infrastructure bill. About 15,000 residents and businesses, mostly in south and west Jackson, were without water Monday and early Tuesday, city officials said. Water pressure is gradually being restored, and most residents should have at least some water coming out of the tap. “Obviously, this is not a position that we want to be in,” Jackson City Engineer Charles Williams said. The water is not safe to drink anywhere in the city until the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water and declares it contaminant-free. The boil order will probably be lifted gradually as water pressure is restored, Williams said, with Thursday the soonest the order may be lifted in any part of Jackson. Williams said the city received a bad batch of aluminum chlorohydrate, a chemical used to treat drinking water, and workers shut down part of the water treatment system at the O.B. Curtis plant Saturday. None of the chemical made it into the city’s water supply, and residents were not exposed, Williams said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: State Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued the city’s school district Tuesday over its response to his office’s requests for records related to critical race theory and anti-racist teaching. Schmitt’s office submitted a Sunshine Law request in October seeking records from the district relating to how and whether it teaches critical race theory. Schmitt, a Republican running for Senate, alleges in the lawsuit that the district broke the law by demanding payment for services other than copies before it would make public records available to his office. He also contends the district didn’t use hourly rates that would have kept the cost of fulfilling the request as low as possible, as required by law. The district initially required a deposit of $37,000 to process the request before it began searching for records, according to the lawsuit. Schmitt’s lawsuit claims the district has used critical race theory in its teachers’ training for at least two years, citing as an example a training program in 2020 for about 170 teachers and staff that would “create shared understanding … around complex issues of systemic racism and xenophobia” and allow them to “receive tools on how to become anti-racist.” District spokesman Stephen Hall said in a statement that the district focuses on equity but does not teach critical race theory.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Native American tribes in the state – including the Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and Fort Belknap Indian Community, as well as the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council – have expressed support for a bill that would establish a panel to look into the history of U.S. efforts to force assimilation. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the U.S. Act would establish a formal, diverse commission to investigate and document Indian boarding school policies, including the U.S. government’s attempt to terminate Indigenous cultures, religions and languages. The commission should recommend practices for the federal government to acknowledge these atrocities and promote healing. The panel would also hold culturally sensitive public hearings for boarding school survivors and community members. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council in October passed a resolution supporting congressional efforts in approving the act. Lauren Monroe Jr., council secretary, said past atrocities still influence Indigenous people today. “For Blackfeet people that don’t speak the language or don’t know our history, this isn’t so much in the past as it is in the present,” he said. “Until we have this conversation, there can’t be progress or healing.”\n\nNebraska\n\nScottsbluff: A fire that had burned about 2,560 acres in northwest Nebraska was about 40% contained, officials said Tuesday. The fire in the Buffalo Creek Wildlife Management Area in Scotts Bluff and Banner counties began Sunday, and efforts to contain it are expected to last through the week, The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The Buffalo Creek wildlife area is about 7 miles southeast of Gering and Scottsbluff. No homes had been burned, no injuries were reported, and no evacuations had been necessary, according to an update provided Tuesday. The firefighting effort has included helicopters, with 27 departments supplying resources and firefighters, who have been working 16-hour shifts, the Scottsbluff Star Herald reports. The National Weather Service posted a red flag warning for the area, which means any fire that ignites could grow rapidly. The area was reporting temperatures in the 50s and the 60s, 20% humidity and wind speeds of 20-30 mph.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man’s admission that he voted twice in November 2020 in a case on which state Republicans seized to claim voter irregularities amounted to “a cheap political stunt” that backfired, a state court judge said Tuesday. Donald “Kirk” Hartle appeared by videoconference from his defense attorney’s office to plead guilty to a misdemeanor – voting more than once in the same election – and told Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny he accepted full responsibility for his actions and regrets them. Hartle’s attorney, David Chesnoff, prevented his client from having to describe publicly how he voted early using a ballot that had been mailed to his dead wife. Rosemarie Hartle died in 2017, but her name remained on the voter rolls. Chesnoff told the judge that state Attorney General Aaron Ford’s office agreed to reduce two felony charges against Hartle to the misdemeanor. Kierny made it clear she was unhappy with the deal but accepted it. Hartle was fined $2,000 and has to stay out of trouble for one year. The judge set a Nov. 17, 2022, date to review the result. “This seems to me to be a cheap political stunt that kind of backfired,” Kierny said, “and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The city is getting a $25 million federal grant to help improve transportation in the South Millyard area. The grant was announced by the state’s congressional delegation Tuesday. “This project will mitigate traffic congestion, provide increased transportation options including biking and walking trails and a pedestrian bridge over Granite Street and create opportunities for development throughout South Elm Street,” Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said in a statement. “This is a big deal for the City of Manchester.” The grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation will be allocated through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant program. Manchester’s award ties with the state of New Mexico for the largest RAISE grant in the country this year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are proposing financial relief for the city’s casinos to help them continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic by exempting two of the industry’s fastest-growing revenue streams from calculations on how much the casinos should pay the city. It would reduce payments for some casinos, including the Borgata, while imposing higher payments onto others, including Hard Rock. The bill, advanced Monday by a state Senate committee, is a renewal of a measure requiring the casinos to make payments in lieu of taxes to Atlantic City that was first enacted five years ago, when the city was reeling from the closure of five of its 12 casinos. There currently are nine casinos. Easily able back then to show that their businesses were worth less in a declining market, the casinos successfully appealed their property tax assessments year after year, helping to blow huge holes in Atlantic City’s budget. Meanwhile, New Jersey’s red-hot sports betting industry smashed its own national record in October for the highest amount of bets taken in a single month, topping $1.3 billion. That figure easily surpassed the $1.01 billion worth of bets that Atlantic City’s nine casinos and the three horse tracks that offer sports betting took in September.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nEunice: The city is looking to salty underground sources as it seeks an “unlimited” supply of water. The Eunice City Council recently voted to have a Hobbs-based engineering firm continue studying the benefits of building a desalination plant for the community. Amid depletion of fresh water from the Ogallala Aquifer continues, the council wants to know the feasibility of a proposed alternative: desalination of saline or brackish water. The Hobbs News-Sun reports it could cost about $5.5 million to build a plant, and the completion of the engineering study likely will provide a more accurate estimate. City Manager Jordan Yutzy told the councilors that the engineering work by Pettigrew and Associates will cost about $464,000. State funds are paying for the work. The engineering firm began the study last summer to determine whether water from underground brackish aquifers can economically be desalinated for human consumption. The Ogallala Aquifer underlies portions of eight states, in which agriculture, commercial industry and residences use more than is replenished from rainfall or snowmelt. Below the freshwater aquifer are saline and brackish water supplies that need to be treated, often at high cost, before human consumption.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new effort to find a mass-transit solution for LaGuardia Airport after a $2 billion rail link project was put on hold amid criticism from public officials will look at options including ferry service, a subway extension and dedicated bus lanes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, announced Tuesday that it has commissioned a panel to review alternatives for LaGuardia, one of the few major airports in the country without a rail link. The panel will consist of Mike Brown, former London transportation commissioner and managing director of Heathrow Airport; Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner; and Philip Washington, the CEO of Denver International Airport and a former CEO of Los Angeles Metro. Tom Wright, president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, a New York-based think tank, called the formation of the panel “the right move at a critical time for our region.” A 1.5-mile elevated railway linking the airport to a rail station near CitiField in Queens was given environmental approved by federal regulators in July, but the plan prompted criticism from Gov. Kathy Hochul and other officials, as well as a lawsuit from an environmental group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The largest school system in the state said none of its students went hungry Tuesday despite a sickout by school cafeteria workers demanding better pay and improved working conditions. Leaders at the Wake County Public School System warned parents that another sickout could affect food services at other schools Wednesday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Late Monday evening, the Wake County school system alerted families at 32 schools that they should bring their own lunch on Tuesday because the system couldn’t guarantee meal service. But a tweet sent in the morning indicated the district was able to provide meals to every student who wanted one. The district provided bagged lunches to students, according to Lisa Luten, a school spokeswoman. Luten also said parents and local businesses and restaurants also brought in food for students Tuesday. WCPSS warned Tuesday night that 15 schools could be affected by staffing shortages Wednesday. The sickout comes as a 19% vacancy rate is forcing the cafeteria workers to do more work than before. Two weeks ago, dozens of WCPSS school bus drivers called out sick for a three-day protest that disrupted bus service for many students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Defense Department’s internal watchdog said its investigation into a $400 million border wall contract found it was properly awarded to a North Dakota firm whose owner used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job. The Pentagon’s inspector general on Monday released results of the audit, requested last year by House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. He asked for the review of the contract awarded to Dickinson, North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that the company’s bid met standards and that the contract was awarded in accordance with federal procurement regulations. “We reviewed Fisher Sand and Gravel’s proposal, compared it to the solicitation, and agreed with (the Corps’) assessment that it was the LPTA (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable) and was properly awarded the contract,” the audit said. Company President Tommy Fisher is a GOP supporter and has appeared on conservative media touting his company as the best pick for building the wall that former President Donald Trump made a priority. The company was awarded a contract to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona but had little experience with such construction.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A transit officer who was captured on surveillance video shoving a 68-year-old man off a rail platform and onto the tracks in February has been charged. Patrick Rivera, 41, pleaded not guilty to three charges, including first-degree misdemeanor assault, on Saturday, cleveland.com reports. Rivera was placed on unpaid leave after charges were filed, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority spokesperson Linda Scardilli Krecic told the news outlet. Rivera was called to the site because the man refused to move his belongings when asked by a custodian, cleveland.com reports. Rivera wrote in a report that the man was aggressive and lunged at him, at which point he shoved the man. Video footage shows that the interaction happened quickly and that Rivera and another officer prevented the man from immediately climbing back up onto the platform even though trains were active on that track. Rivera wrote two citations for the man after he shoved him, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after a psychologist found the man was not competent to stand trial because of mental illness. Rivera was not fired or suspended because he signed an agreement with RTA that he would be fired if he “makes another mistake” in the next year. Former RTA Police Chief Michael Gettings called Rivera’s actions “unacceptable.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students across the metro area walked out of classes Wednesday in support of death row inmate Julius Jones, who is scheduled to be executed Thursday. Students at Northwest Classen, Classen SAS, Putnam City North, Harding Charter and John Marshall staged walkouts Wednesday morning. Students were seen congregating in parking lots and on football fields. The walkouts happened as Jones’ supporters awaited word from Gov. Kevin Stitt on whether he will grant Jones clemency ahead of his scheduled execution. Oklahoma City rapper and activist Jabee Williams, a longtime supporter of Jones, spoke to the students from Classen SAS, who marched about 10 blocks from their school to the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. “Julius loves you, he appreciates you, and he knows he is not alone,” Williams said. “What you guys did today was so brave.” He said there is a dark cloud hanging over Oklahoma right now. “If this man is executed, there’s a part of us that will be executed too. We won’t be the same,” Williams said. Greg Robinson, a community organizer and supporter of Jones from Tulsa, also praised the students for their walkout in support of Jones. “Why is it that a group of high schoolers,” Robinson said, “got more courage than the people that walk through this building?”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A philanthropist filed papers with the secretary of state on Tuesday to decriminalize sex work in Oregon, aiming to put the issue before voters in the 2022 election. “Sex worker rights are human rights, and the denial of those rights enables human trafficking,” said chief petitioner Aaron Boonshoft, who filed the prospective petition for the Sex Worker Rights Act. Advocates said Oregon’s laws that criminalize sex work make it difficult for workers to report rape, harassment and human trafficking to police, fearing they themselves could be arrested. Organizers of the effort said the proposal would end criminal penalties for participating in consensual adult sex work and add health and safety protections while maintaining laws against human trafficking. “Our current system is broken and harms sex workers,” said Anne Marie Backstrom, political director for the campaign. “Sex workers deserve to do their job without fear of arrest or violence, and, like all workers, they deserve access to health care, labor protections and public services.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A bill to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit was passed by a divided state House on Tuesday but faces a veto threat from the governor. The parties were split in the vote, as occurred in the state Senate last week, with Republicans mostly supporting it and Democrats mostly opposed. Supporters said that getting concealed carry permits under current law can be subject to the whims of county sheriffs and that permit holders can forget when their licenses expire and therefore unknowingly violate the law. Opponents pointed out the proposal is unlikely to be enacted, as Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s office said he will veto the legislation, and argued the bill would make people less safe by making guns more readily accessible. Pennsylvanians are generally allowed to openly carry loaded firearms, although current law is silent on it. Only in Philadelphia is a permit required for it. The legislation sent to Wolf would remove Philadelphia’s open-carry permit requirement, as well as the state’s requirement for people to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon, including for storing them in their cars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Civil rights organizations have sued the state’s Department of Corrections on behalf of a man who alleges his rights were violated when he was held in solitary confinement for eight months as punishment for his complaints about prison conditions. The Rhode Island Center for Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island sued the state’s corrections director and other prison administrators at the behest of Joseph Shepard, 28, on Monday. In the lawsuit, Shepard alleges his constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated when prison administrators put him in solitary confinement in retaliation for raising concerns. A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said the state disagreed that Shepard had served time in solitary confinement because the prison system “does not practice solitary confinement, as we have stated on the record numerous times.” Shepard claimed in the lawsuit that he brought concerns about prison conditions to administrators but was told to follow the formal grievance procedure. In response, Shepard sent documents to civil rights groups to bring attention to the cause. He was then placed in high-security segregation for eight months for being in possession of documents that had never been identified as contraband, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House will return to Columbia next month for a special session about redistricting. House Speaker Jay Lucas said the House will first meet at 2 p.m. Dec. 1 with the primary focus on approving the new state House, Senate and U.S. House districts based on 2020 U.S. census data. The chamber may also be in session Dec. 2 and Dec. 6 if necessary. The Senate hasn’t announced the dates it might meet in special session, but they are expected to gather in early December, too, because that would leave three months for legal challenges about the new maps to be resolved before filing for the new districts in the 2022 elections begins in March. The Legislature set aside only a few issues that can be taken up in the special session without a two-thirds vote. They include redistricting and spending billions of dollars in federal pandemic funds and from a settlement with the federal government over radioactive material stored past a deadline at the Savannah River Site. The list of items did not include COVID-19 vaccine or mask mandates. The General Assembly returns in January for the second year of its regular session.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem’s daughter says she’ll quit the real estate appraiser business following scrutiny over whether her mother used her influence to aid her application for an appraiser license. Kassidy Peters slammed a legislative inquiry and news reporting on the episode in a letter to Secretary of Labor Marcia Hultman on Tuesday. She also released a document that a legislative committee was seeking to subpoena. Lawmakers were zeroing in on the timeline of a meeting Noem called last year that included Peters and key decision-makers in a government agency that had moved days earlier to deny her application for an upgrade to her appraiser certification. “I am writing you today to express my disappointment and anger that my good name and professional reputation continue to be damaged by questions and misinformation concerning the Appraiser Certification Program,” Peters wrote to Hultman in the letter. She told Hultman she would turn in her license by the end of the year, adding: “I’m angry and I can acknowledge that this has successfully destroyed my business.” The Republican-dominated Government Operations and Audit Committee had requested the document to confirm Hultman’s assertion that state regulators had already decided to give Peters another chance to win her appraiser certification prior to the meeting in the governor’s mansion. Noem echoed that defense in a later news conference. But the signed agreement with Peters is dated the week after the July 27, 2020, meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Universities, transportation agencies and the operator of a national laboratory are among those landing exemptions to a new state law that strictly limits or prohibits most government entities and businesses from implementing COVID-19 prevention mandates. For some, approval was almost immediate. Six of the 19 entities that submitted requests Monday – the first day to apply – were granted exemptions to the new law’s stringent requirements. Tennessee now largely bars governments and businesses from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination and only lets schools and other public entities require masks in rare, dire public health situations. Exemptions also are allowed if groups can show they would lose federal funding by complying with the state law, which conflicts with policies implemented by President Joe Biden’s administration. Early exemptions have been given to Vanderbilt University, the University of Tennessee system, the University of Memphis, East Tennessee State University and UT-Batelle, which operates Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Crockett County Ambulance Service also was approved, though state officials noted that certain Medicare and Medicaid providers are already exempt. Other medical providers also applied.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrat Beto O’Rourke said Wednesday that he has raised more than $2 million after announcing his campaign for governor Monday, showing a persistent ability to quickly pile up cash after coming off failed runs for the U.S. Senate and presidency. The money came from more than 31,000 donations in the first 24 hours, with 57% of the contributions coming from Texas, spokesman Abhi Rahman said. Small donors have powered O’Rourke’s massive fundraising hauls in the past, but his campaign did not disclose a breakdown of contribution sizes so far. The numbers showed an early burst of enthusiasm for the former El Paso congressman, who in one day raised more money than the entire campaign of Democrats’ little-known candidate for Texas governor in 2018. But O’Rourke still has a long way to catch or even approach Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who this summer reported having at least $55 million in his campaign account, more than any incumbent governor in the country. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, routinely collects six-figure donations in big money from Texas executives. The Lone Star State’s sheer size makes mounting a statewide campaign costly, and Abbott and O’Rourke are likely to make this among the most expensive governor’s races in the country.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Gov. Spencer Cox cut the ceremonial opening ribbon Monday for a new business center. The Cedar City Business and Innovation Center is meant to provide a space for community members, students and businesses to come together to discuss entrepreneurial ideas, said Brennan Wood, president of Southwest Technical College. In a speech, Cox touted the center as a place that could be used as a “model” for other business centers to open in the state, saying he sees these centers as playing an important role in Utah’s economic future. “This is how we future-proof our education system,” he said. “It’s how we future-proof our economy. We do that by working together and innovating together.” The Cedar City center is located on the grounds of Southwest Technical College but isn’t technically an extension of the college, as the center had many other partners in its opening. Those include Southern Utah University, the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, the office of economic development for Cedar City and Iron County, and the Women’s Business Center of Utah. The center’s main mission is to help people handle the early challenges of starting a small business by offering office space, professional equipment, opportunities for business guidance and businesses classes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An audit has found that the cost of state employee health care jumped between 2010 and 2019 and urged changes to save money. The report released by State Auditor Doug Hoffer found that the cost of annual medical reimbursements for state employees, retirees and their families increased 51% in that time, from $94 million to $142 million. One reason the report identified for the increase was that different health providers charged different amounts for the same care. “The difference in prices paid for the exact same health care procedures under the State employee health plan is startling, especially since higher prices do not necessarily mean higher quality,” Hoffer said in a statement. The reports suggests that the state move to reference-based pricing, in which the state would set a maximum price it would pay for any service instead of paying the price negotiated by the health care provider and insurance company. Hoffer said that could save the state $16.3 million annually. A second suggestion is to provide state workers, retirees and their families with information about the cost of care and implement a cash incentive for them to use less expensive options. The report predicted this could save $202,000 annually if implemented for seven specific services.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A school board rescinded a directive for staff to pull books with “sexually explicit” books from libraries early Tuesday after hours of passionate public comment. The Spotsylvania County school board voted 5-2 to reverse the order amid public backlash, but some board members said they’ll continue to take a stance against the inclusion of what they view as offensive material in school library books, The Free Lance-Star reports. Board members Rabih Abuismail and Kirk Twigg, who spoke of burning books at last week’s meeting, did not support the reversal. “I think we should throw those books on the fire,” Abuismail said at the Nov. 8 school board meeting, while Twigg said many “would like to see the books before we burn them so we can identify within our community that we are eradicating this bad stuff.” Monday’s specially called meeting on the matter was held at the Chancellor High School auditorium to accommodate the large number of speakers expected. It stretched past midnight as dozens of parents, students, teachers and librarians spoke, most in support of libraries and books. Two speakers, both high school students, spoke in favor of removing books from library shelves. Comments were cut off at midnight.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The head of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission that failed to meet its deadline for redrawing political maps urged state Supreme Court justices to consider their work nonetheless now that the high court will have to complete the process. The panel had a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday to approve new boundaries for congressional and legislative districts following the 2020 census but acknowledged Tuesday that it had not been able to complete its task on time. This is the first time the panel has failed to finish its work on time since the state adopted a constitutional amendment giving redistricting authority to a bipartisan commission after the 1990 census. “While we acknowledge we missed the deadline for our maps to be considered by the Legislature, we see no reason why the Court can’t do so,” Commission Chair Sarah Augustine said in a statement late Tuesday night. “These maps reflect the input of the thousands of people who took part in the process with us. It would be a shame to see these maps go unconsidered simply because the clock struck 12.” Despite the plea to the Supreme Court, many were critical of the process by the panel – especially in the final hours Monday night, when there were complaints its deliberations were closed to the public and may have violated open meetings laws.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two trees to be displayed in the West Virginia Capitol during the holidays will feature photos recognizing military and first responders. West Virginians can submit photos to be displayed on the trees, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice and first lady Cathy Justice. The trees will be placed in the west rotunda of the main Capitol building. A third tree will be decorated by Gold Star mothers and families to honor people who died while serving the country. Photos will not be returned, and photocopies should be submitted. The military recognition form and the first responder recognition form and tag are available online. Photos, submission forms and tags must be received by Nov. 29. They can be submitted by email to first.lady@wv.gov or regular mail to attention of Katie Morris, West Virginia Governor’s Mansion, 1716 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two top state Republicans are criticizing mandatory University of Wisconsin-Madison sexual violence prevention training that includes references to privilege, identity and critical race theory. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Tuesday wrote a letter to the school chancellor demanding answers on why graduate students are required to watch the two-hour webinar that university spokesperson John Lucas said includes “a brief reference” to critical race theory, which he said is supported by academic research and noted in the citations. Critical race theory is an academic framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people. It has become a catchall political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history, and conservatives have seized on the concept to galvanize their base. Vos said it was “unacceptable” and “appalling” to mandate a class that “instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race.” Gubernatorial candidate and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch first drew attention to the training in a video she posted on Facebook last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: A small city in the top U.S. coal-mining state will be home to a Bill Gates-backed experimental nuclear power project near a coal-fired power plant that will soon close, officials announced Tuesday. Bellevue, Washington-based TerraPower will build its Natrium plant in Kemmerer, a southwestern Wyoming city of 2,600 where the coal-fired Naughton power plant operated by PacifiCorp subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power is set to close in 2025. “Our innovative technology will help ensure the continued production of reliable electricity while also transitioning our energy system and creating new, good-paying jobs in Wyoming,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a statement. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after officials from the U.S. and other countries pledged at a global climate-change summit in Scotland to continue working to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/18"}]}

For the best representation of food in every way — excellent bistros, three-star Michelin restaurants, charcutiers, bouchers, poissoniers, boulangers, patissiers, chocolatiers, glaciers, petits marches and of course the world-famous market, Rungis, which is the finest representation of the 'belly' of France.\n\nWhere and what is the best meal you've ever eaten?\n\nToo many to recall, but in 1980 my farewell dinner to France before I came to America was at Le Juana in Juan-Les-Pins, where my friend Alain Ducasse (age 24 at the time) was chef. He made me one of the best meals I've ever had, pure simplicity and perfection! It was an eight-course meal, from boat and farm to table… seafood including sea urchins, langoustes, rougets, rascasses and cigalle de mer was fished from his own fisherman; that was followed by wild squab and spring lamb from the Alpes de Provence; and we finished with cheese and a tasting of freshly-stirred ice cream with just-picked fraises des bois.\n\nWhat is one place that's specifically influenced your cooking and how?\n\nNot one but three places: Lyon, Provence and South West of France. These places taught me the importance and the depth of soulful regional cuisine, and the chefs who were associated with those regions were my early mentors.\n\nDo you have a favorite hotel?\n\nBesides any Relais & Chateaux around the world, anywhere that there is a sense of family-run hospitality.

It is a beautiful, small hotel by the lakeside where the food is fabulous and there is total peace and quiet.\n\nWhat's the strangest thing you've ever eaten? Where? Did you like it?\n\nSea cucumber in Beijing. It was prepared with different textures and tastes… not my kind of food, especially when you see them swimming in the tank before.\n\nWhat's the one thing people need to experience or eat in your city?\n\nIn New York, the original db Burger at db Bistro Moderne! It is a burger I created in 2000 made of ground sirloin, braised short ribs with truffle and foie gras in a parmesan potato bun. It was an instant hit and started the trend of gourmet burgers around the world.

A very meaningful and powerful moment for all of us.\n\nWhere's the coolest place you've served a meal?\n\nIn a private jet at 50,000 feet with amazing wine, great friends and three-star Michelin Chef Michel Troisgros. We made scrambled eggs with truffles for 12 people in a microwave. It took us 25 minutes to perfectly scramble the eggs!\n\nWhat's your best \"lost in translation\" where things went horribly or comically awry?\n\nWhen I opened my restaurant Maison Boulud in Beijing and I needed a translator for everything I was saying or doing including running service in the kitchen. We asked our supplier if he had frog legs and I guess his answer was yes. He came back three days later with a plastic bag full of live frogs of all sizes and didn't even know what to do with it. We had to teach him how to kill them, peel them and dress them on ice so we could consider working with him.\n\nWhat's the most indulgent thing you've ever treated yourself to while traveling?\n\nI went to Zurich with my caviar supplier from Maine, Rod Mitchell, to select and buy the new harvest of caviar of all types. We took a break for lunch and for eight people at the table, we had five cans of 2.2 kilos of Sevruga, two types of Oscetra, Beluga, and pressed caviar, steamed potatoes and crème fraiche -- that's what we call caviar by the ladle. I must have eaten half a kilo myself!!\n\nWhat are you picky about when traveling?\n\nMy seat on planes (has to recline to 180 degrees) and the food (I often try to eat well before a long trip so I don't have to deal with airline food).

He was working in Paris at the famed La Tour D’Argent, a grueling first step on the journey from his childhood in the mountains of Andorra to where he is now — one of the most admired chefs in the world, leading Manhattan’s elegant Le Bernardin for more than 20 years.\n\nBut one day, it occurred to him that perhaps he should be a fashion model instead.\n\n“I had finally started dating,” he explains with a grin. “And a girlfriend said, ‘Wow, you’re good-looking, you should be a model!’ ”\n\nRipert’s mother back in Andorra, a tiny principality between Spain and France, was dismayed. But she had fashion-world connections, and arranged a meeting for her son at the Courreges label. And that’s where they put him straight. “Listen,” a man at the fashion house told Ripert. “You may think you’re good-looking, and probably in your home village, you are. But this is Paris!”\n\nIt was, Ripert says now, “the shortest meeting I ever had in my life.”\n\nSomehow, that anecdote never made it into Ripert’s engrossing new memoir, “32 Yolks,” which came out this week. But the 51-year-old chef recalled it as he sat down with The Associated Press recently at Le Bernardin and reflected on his arduous climb to the pinnacle of the culinary world. Being a top chef was a dream he’d had since he was a young boy hanging out after school in a local chef’s kitchen, polishing off bowls of chocolate mousse.\n\n“I always had a passion for eating — and for good ingredients,” Ripert says.\n\nThat passion for ingredients had been on display just minutes before the interview, as Ripert prepared for the restaurant’s lunchtime opening. His first task was to sample the sauces, as he does each day in his bustling but airy kitchen, staffed by more than 50 cooks. “Too spicy,” he had quietly pronounced of the sauce intended for octopus.\n\n“Spicy is good,” he explained later, “but what we don’t want is to be burned here” — he touched the sides of his throat. The cook in charge of the sauce station was already correcting the situation by discarding half, then adding more and calibrating the ingredients. It’s hardly a simple task; the sauce station is the toughest in the kitchen.\n\n“You start with salads and move up in the hierarchy and end in the sauce station,” Ripert says, echoing his own training. “In every kitchen it’s the most difficult. Because you’re basically capturing flavors in a liquid, and that’s complicated.”\n\nAnd it’s not just about capturing flavors, but by keeping them calibrated all night long. “The last client should have the same taste as the first client. But some ingredients expand, and some die,” he explains. “And some are killers, they destroy everything.” A drop of lemon juice, for example: “An hour later any other flavor that was with it is dead.”\n\nRipert knows well what it’s like to be that guy at the kitchen station — any station. “32 Yolks” refers to his disastrous first day at La Tour d’Argent, his first job out of culinary school. He was asked to mince some shallots; he sliced his finger open on the first one. Then he was asked to take 32 yolks and make a hollandaise sauce. He bombed. Then he was asked to fetch some chervil. He had no idea what it looked like.\n\nTwo weeks later, he hoisted a three-foot tall pot of boiling water and lost control. When he removed his socks, his scalded skin peeled off with them. He was sent home for a three-week recovery, but hobbled back a week later with swollen feet to show his dedication.\n\nAnd worse was to come. Ripert’s next boss, culinary wizard Joel Robuchon, was obsessed with earning a third Michelin star, and worked his staff to extremes; once, he asked them to peel every single pea individually, to remove a tiny sprout inside. “I saw a few guys punch the walls,” Ripert writes of his time there. “Some guys suffered crippling anxiety attacks.” Still, he greatly admires Robuchon’s talent and calls him “my hero.”\n\nRipert also writes with frankness of his childhood — of happy years with his father before his parents divorced, and unhappy times afterward with his stepfather, who bullied him, made his home life hell, and sent him to boarding school, where, he writes, a priest made advances on him. Throughout, food saved him: He ended up at culinary school, which launched his career.\n\nRipert was in his 20s when he got the offer to go to Washington and work for French chef Jean-Louis Palladin at the Watergate Hotel (the book ends here). We have to ask, was it finally smooth sailing?\n\nHardly, Ripert laughs.\n\n“I didn’t speak English,” he says. “And I guess I had an ego, and the naive idea that America was the continent of the burgers, and I was coming to save the world. I expected a red carpet. That was a rude awakening.” Things got so tough, he thought of going home.\n\nBut he stayed, and in 1991, he was summoned to New York by Gilbert LeCoze at Le Bernardin. Three years later, LeCoze died, and Ripert took over as head chef. The rest is culinary history, and Ripert sees no end coming soon.\n\n“Passion never goes away,” he says. “I’ll be here for a long time.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/02/01/3-star-chef-found-dead-apparent-suicide/79629056/", "title": "3-star chef found dead in apparent suicide", "text": "Gregg Zoroya\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion\n\nAcclaimed French-Swiss chef Benoit Violier, whose restaurant was rated in December as the world's finest, was found dead Sunday of an apparent suicide in his home in Crissier, Switzerland. Police said he shot himself to death.\n\nThe 44-year-old Violier's death shocked the culinary world. His Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville with its specialty of game cuisine had earned three Michelin stars. In December, it was named the world's best restaurant, the finest of 1,000 across 48 countries reviewed by France's \"La Liste.\" The hotel is located in Crissier, near the city of Lausanne in southwestern Switzerland.\n\n\"We are shocked by the death of Benoit Violier, chef of immense talent. Our thoughts go to his family and to his teams,\" the Michelin guide tweeted Sunday.\n\nHis suicide is not the first within the highly competitive world of culinary artists, where reputations rise or fall on the opinions of vaunted rating guides. Renowned chef Bernard Loiseau was found dead in his home of an apparent suicide in 2003, after his restaurant received a lower rating by the authoritative Gault & Millau guide.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Violier had recently been upset over a small demotion in the same guide that might cause the loss of a Michelin star.\n\nViolier and his wife, Brigitte, took over operation of the Crissier restaurant in 2012.

Violier was named Chef of the Year in 2013 by Gault & Millau, a guide on par with the Michelin. He was a hunter by avocation and his gastronomic specialty became the preparation of game.

The event kicks off the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup schedule and is a crown jewel of endurance racing.\n\nCalling it an event on his \"bucket list\" earlier in the week, Newgarden will be joined by Team Penske IndyCar teammate Scott McLaughlin, who will also make his debut in the event. Chip Ganassi Racing development driver Kyffin Simpson and reigning IMSA LMP2 champion John Farano will complete the star-studded driver lineup in the No. 8 Tower Motorsports entry.\n\nROLEX 24 AT DAYTONA: New Daytona-Le Mans prototypes get first hot laps ahead of '23 season\n\nNewgarden is a decorated open-wheeler, having won the 2017 and 2019 IndyCar Series championships. But his appearance in the Rolex 24 will mark the culmination of a long-held aspiration and Tuesday and Wednesday offered key learning opportunities for a driver that hasn't piloted a sportscar since running IMSA Lites in 2008.\n\nNewgarden hoped to get into fine-tuning over the course of the two days but goals were a little more basic in Tuesday's initial run, such as simply cranking the engine.\n\n\"The way you start it,\" Newgarden said with a sheepish smile. \"Just getting going. Getting familiar with the team, getting familiar with the car, more just learning the procedures.\n\n\"There's a lot of differences from IndyCar, just trying to get my head around that initially. Then, we can start diving into race-performance stuff — how we're going to be on long runs, how the car really feels — but the procedural stuff is really first on my list.\"\n\nAfter successfully getting the engine fired, Newgarden found himself making laps on the 3.56-mile Rolex 24 course at one of the world's most famous race tracks. The moment wasn't lost on the native of Nashville, who will turn 32 later this month.\n\n\"Total treat,\" he said. \"Always wanted to run here. Been trying to run this race for a long time and for it to finally work out was exciting.\"\n\nIn terms of first impressions?.\n\n\"It's amazing how you don't really notice the (31-degree) banking as much as you assume,\" Newgarden said. \"When you're in the car doing 160-plus miles per hour, you don't notice the level of banking that is here and it's quite high.\n\n\"We run at places with pretty high banking. Texas is up there too but not at Daytona's level. It just always blows me away that once you get up to speed, it's not as it looks when you're sitting there standing still.\"\n\nEasing the process for Newgarden is his ability to lean on McLaughlin, who is undergoing his own endurance-race crash course as well. The connection between the two can be seen in the duo's humorous \"Bus Bros\" YouTube series.\n\n\"We're going to be going through it together,\" Newgarden admitted. \"It's going to be a journey for both of us but that's why I've got my Bus Bro here. We're going to be ready to rock.\"\n\nLargely, this week's testing was to further dial in the new LMDh (Le Mans Daytona hybrid) models, a car announced in 2020 that will fulfill the requirements of both IMSA and the World Endurance Championship (WEC), thus making entries eligible for not only the Rolex race but also the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 12 Hours of Sebring.\n\nThe Tower Motorsports outfit wasn't one of the nine such entries in attendance this week. Those cars, competing in a different class, figure to have a leg up in terms of raw speed and power.\n\nBut over the course of 24 hours, steady could in fact win the race, especially with so many unknowns surrounding the new cars. Mechanical issues popped up for BMW on Tuesday, speaking further to the scramble still going into getting the LMDh race ready.\n\nFor Newgarden, steadiness starts behind the wheel and while the week may have started with the ignition, by the end of two days, his goal was to have a much better understanding of what will be required come race day.\n\n\"When you come to something new and you don't know all the details of it, it's a small detail that can catch you out,\" Newgarden said. \"It's not so much, 'Hey, can I drive the car consistently the whole race.' I feel like I can do that.\n\n\"I can maybe do a good job of staying mistake free, which is going to be important for this kind of event. It's going to be knowing the details and knowing what I don't know at this point. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything when I show up.\"\n\nReach Ryan Pritt at rpritt@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @RPritt.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2024/10/01/caf-bouluds-new-head-chef-christopher-zabita-excited-to-be-part-of-palm-beach-scene/75454780007/", "title": "Café Boulud's new head chef excited to be part of Palm Beach scene", "text": "M.M.

Here's why", "text": "President Donald Trump weighed in on social media Sunday night about his portrait hanging in the Colorado Capitol, criticizing it and Gov. Jared Polis while demanding the artwork be taken down.\n\nThe oil painting, which depicts Trump in a dark suit with a red tie, sits in the building’s Gallery of Presidents.\n\n“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older.”\n\nWhy doesn’t Trump like his portrait in the Colorado Capitol?\n\nWhile Trump called the portrait “distorted,” it’s not clear why he suddenly aired his grievances about the artwork, which has been hanging since 2019.\n\nIn the post, he said: “Many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. In fact, they are actually angry about it! I am speaking on their behalf.”\n\nSarah Boardman, the artist who painted the portrait, said in advance of the unveiling in 2019 that she tried to put aside any personal thoughts about Trump and portray him with neutrality.\n\n“I consider a neutrally thoughtful, and non-confrontational, portrait allows everyone to reach their own conclusions in their own time, in addition to that approach being more durable over time,” she told the Colorado Times Recorder in March 2019. “Personal views about a subject do not define, and are separate from, a piece of art in the Gallery of Presidents.”\n\nWhy did Jared Polis ‘put up’ the portrait?\n\nActually, he didn’t.\n\nPolis, the state’s Democratic governor, was criticized in Trump’s social media post for being “extremely weak on Crime, in particular with respect to Tren de Aragua,” but had no involvement in the project.\n\nThe portrait was paid for by a crowdfunding campaign led by Republicans who were frustrated that no money had been collected by mid-2018 by the nonprofit that typically raised funds for portraits in the gallery.\n\nThe crowdfunding group, led by former state Senate President Kevin Grantham, chose Boardman to paint it.\n\n“Whether this portrait brings a smile or scowl to your face, remember you have the right to do so because this is the United States of America,” Grantham, a Republican, said just before the unveiling, according to a Denver Post article from 2019.\n\nWill the portrait be taken down?\n\nColorado officials have not said if any action will be taken in response to the criticism.\n\n“Gov. Polis was surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork,” Eric Maruyama, a spokesperson for Polis, told the USA TODAY Network in an email Monday morning.\n\n“We appreciate the President and everyone’s interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience,” the statement also said.\n\nNate Trela covers trending news in Colorado and Utah for the USA TODAY Network.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/14/wild-bus-two-headed-turtle-statues-unveiled-news-around-states/119048660/", "title": "'Into the Wild' bus, two-headed turtle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDaphne: A coastal city is warning residents to be careful of alligators, which have been showing up in populated areas following recent heavy rains.

Charles Epler of Wildlife Solutions, an animal removal services, said the sightings likely were linked to the weather. “They get pushed out. That heavy, torrential rain washes them out of where they’re at, and then they’re going to try and find somewhere else to set up shop,” Epler said. Daphne, a city of about 26,000, is located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. “About 83% of their diet in the wild is turtles.

The bus was moved to the school’s engineering facility last week while it’s being prepared for outdoor display at the Museum of the North, television station KTVF reports. The abandoned Fairbanks city bus became a shelter for hunters and others using the backcountry near Denali National Park and Preserve, but it was a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn’t hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. During his last days he kept a journal that was discovered when his body was found. McCandless’ ordeal was chronicled in Jon Krakauer’s 1996 book “Into the Wild,” followed later by director Sean Penn’s movie of the same name. People from all over the world made the bus a focal point and tried to retrace his steps. The state removed the bus located about 25 miles from the town of Healy after two women from Europe drowned on homages to the bus. There were 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, the state Department of Natural Resources said in August 2020 when the bus was flown out of the wilderness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Documents and training materials from the Arizona Department of Corrections’ servers contain images of a skull with a sword through it that experts liken to gang and white supremacist symbols. Corrections experts say the designs may offer a window into the mindset of the department’s Special Operations teams, reflecting an us-against-them mentality and members acting out militaristic fantasies, rather than rehabilitating prisoners. PowerPoint presentations featuring the skull and sword emblem also define the imagery. “Skull = Death before dishonor,” a slide says, while the shotguns are “tools of the trade,” and the eyes of the skull, embellished with gun sights, indicate: “We are always watching you.” Set to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle,” a training video depicts special operations teams responding to riots at the Yuma and Kingman prisons. The video contains graphic images of the aftermath, including zip-tied prisoners, officers using dogs to intimidate prisoners, blood-stained walls and floors, and nonlethal weapons used on inmates. Prisoners alleged special operations officers committed civil rights abuses in the aftermath of the deadly riot at the Yuma prison in March 2018. Thirty-seven people were injured, one prisoner died, and six officers were fired and criminally charged for destroying prisoner property.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday effectively approved a new law that will allow employees to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, a move by fellow Republicans to challenge federal vaccine mandates. Hutchinson allowed the measure to become law without his signature despite his concerns about the impact it will have on businesses in the state. The new law won’t take effect until early next year. In Arkansas, a bill becomes law after it sits on the governor’s desk for five days without any action. Governors have traditionally used that approach to express opposition to legislation without prompting a veto fight with the Legislature. Hutchinson said the amount of time before the opt-out law takes effect gives the state more time to weigh its impact on businesses and for any court challenges to be filed. But he also called the proposal unnecessary and counterproductive. “The debate on these bills has been harmful to our goal of increasing vaccination rates in Arkansas,” he told reporters. The measure requires employers to allow workers to opt out of COVID-19 vaccine requirements if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies. Health officials have said antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity, those who’ve recovered should still get vaccinated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A wildfire raging through Southern California coastal mountains threatened ranches and rural homes and kept a major highway shut down Wednesday as the fire-scarred state faced a new round of dry winds that raise risk of flames. The Alisal Fire covered more than 22 square miles in the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara, and the number of firefighters was nearly doubled to 1,300, with more on the way. Containment remained at 5%. While the scenic region along the Pacific shoreline is lightly populated, the blaze was a threat to more than 100 homes, ranches and other buildings, fire officials said. Fire crews were protecting Rancho del Cielo, which was once owned by Ronald and Nancy Reagan and was known as the Western White House during his presidency. The 688-acre ranch where Reagan hosted world leaders sits atop the mountain range, above the flames feeding on dense chaparral and grasses. The area hadn’t burned since 1955, according to the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation, which now operates the ranch. Crews also protected an Exxon/Mobil gas processing facility in a canyon surrounded by flames. The fire erupted Monday near the Alisal Reservoir and swept down through the mountains, forcing the closure of U.S. 101. At one point, the fire jumped the highway and reached a beach.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will include gender confirmation care in its individual and small-group health insurance plans, state and federal officials announced Tuesday. The state’s plan under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will include jaw, cheek and eye modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast or chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal. Additional health benefits for Colorado’s plan include an annual mental health exam and expanded coverage of opioid alternatives for pain management, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said. The new plan adds 15 drugs as alternatives and will cover up to six acupuncture visits per year, according to the Colorado Division of Insurance. The changes will go into effect Jan. 1, 2023. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved Colorado’s request to provide gender-confirming care as part of the state’s “essential health benefits,” which are requirements for individual and small-employer plans set forth under former the Affordable Care Act. Christy Mallory, legal director at the Williams Institute, a research institute based in the University of California Los Angeles’ School of Law, said without insurance, much of gender-confirming care is “prohibitively expensive,” so Colorado’s move increases access to medically necessary care for trans people.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: President Joe Biden plans to visit the University of Connecticut on Friday for the dedication of a human rights center named after former U.S. Sens. Thomas and Christopher Dodd. The Dodd Center for Human Rights serves as an umbrella home for the school’s human rights programs and archives. Those include the Human Rights Institute, which houses the largest undergraduate and graduate human rights program at a public university in the U.S., and Dodd Impact, which focuses on community-based human rights initiatives. It had been known as the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center since its opening in 1995, named for the late senator who also was a lead prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II. UConn’s Board of Trustees voted in August to change the name to the Dodd Center for Human Rights to recognize the work of both Democratic senators and their family. “I’m deeply grateful to UConn for recognizing me and my family by dedicating the Dodd Center for Human Rights, and I’m honored that my good friend President Biden is joining us to mark this occasion,” said former Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is Thomas Dodd’s son. He served as a senator from 1981 to 2011, gaining a reputation as a human rights advocate for his work to end abuses in Central America.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Auditor Kathy McGuiness turned herself in to authorities and pleaded not guilty to corruption charges Tuesday morning. Accompanied by her attorney, McGuiness entered the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center just before 10 a.m. to turn herself in to Delaware Capitol Police. Steve Wood, her attorney, told the court in a brief hearing that she pleaded not guilty to the charges, including felony theft and intimidation, as well as public service misdemeanors like official misconduct. The basis of the charges is that she violated conflict-of-interest laws by arranging a job for her daughter and her daughter’s friend in the auditor’s office, that she rigged public payments to a campaign consultant to avoid regulatory scrutiny, and that she sought to spy on and intimidate those who questioned her conduct. McGuiness and Wood opposed prosecutors’ request that she be barred from speaking about the case to her daughter. Deputy Attorney General Mark Denney argued that Elizabeth McGuiness is an “unindicted co-conspirator” and a witness. But “to say to a mother that you may not talk to your young daughter about probably the most traumatic event that has occurred for either of them in their lives is unnecessary and inhumane,” Wood argued to the court. The judge sided with McGuiness’ attorney and denied the request.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington National Cathedral formally dedicated a new stone carving of Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in a ceremony Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The carving, completed in April, shows Wiesel’s likeness inside the cathedral’s Human Rights Porch, which features carvings of leading human rights defenders throughout history, including Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, Jonathan Daniels and Eleanor Roosevelt. The dedication was a collaboration among the cathedral, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. “From surviving the Holocaust to becoming one of the world’s leading lights in preserving the memory of that unspeakable tragedy forevermore, we owe a great debt of gratitude to Elie Wiesel,” Cathedral Dean Randy Hollerith said. “It is an honor to have his memory and his legacy included in our Human Rights Porch so he can serve as a reminder of the consequences of hate, as well as the resiliency and indomitability of the human spirit.” Wednesday’s ceremony featured remarks from former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and author John Meacham, who is canon historian of the cathedral. A survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald camps, Wiesel told his story to millions through his autobiographical novel “Night.”\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A statue of Black educator Mary McLeod Bethune will be on display for two months in the city before heading to its permanent home in the U.S. Capitol, where it’s replacing a sculpture of a Confederate soldier as one of two statues from the Sunshine State in the building’s National Statuary Hall. The 11-foot marble statue of Bethune, a civil rights leader and adviser to President Franklin Roosevelt, was unveiled Monday at the News-Journal Center in Daytona Beach. The statue depicts Bethune, a founder of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, wearing a graduation cap and gown and holding a black rose. Early next year, Bethune will become the first Black woman represented in the National Statuary Hall, where each state has two likenesses of prominent native sons and daughters. “The sculpture is a gleaming representation of what is possible with unyielding tenacity and dogged determination,” Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry said. The statue of Bethune replaces one of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Confederate monuments across the country have fallen in recent years amid contentious debate over whether they are proud monuments to Southern heritage or hated symbols of racism and past slavery.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit alleging fraud in the state’s most populous county during the 2020 election. The suit sought a review of some 147,000 absentee ballots to see if any were illegitimate. Originally filed in December, the lawsuit that alleged evidence of fraudulent ballots and improper ballot counting in Fulton County was filed by nine Georgia voters and spearheaded by Garland Favorito, a longtime critic of the state’s election systems. Henry County Superior Court Chief Judge Brian Amero’s order dismissing the case said the voters who brought the suit “failed to allege a particularized injury” and therefore lacked the standing to claim their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process had been violated. Amero also noted that Georgia’s Secretary of State’s Office had provided a “substantive and detailed response” to his request for an update on any investigations into allegations of fraudulent or counterfeit ballots in Fulton County. Favorito expressed frustration after the ruling, saying his team had “prepared diligently to show the evidence of our allegations” at a hearing the judge had previously scheduled for Nov. 15. Angered by his narrow loss in a traditionally red state, former President Donald Trump had focused his fury on Georgia and particularly on Fulton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has not experienced a large spike in evictions despite the expiration of state and federal moratoriums meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect renters during the pandemic’s economic downturn. Tracey Wiltgen, executive director of the Mediation Center of the Pacific, said her organization has handled more cases in recent months but not as many as she anticipated, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Between Aug. 7 and Oct. 2, the center opened 565 eviction cases for mediation – fewer than the 1,000-1,500 cases it had expected. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Wiltgen said, the center mediated about 200 eviction cases per month. A state-level moratorium ended Aug. 6. A few weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal moratorium that was announced by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. David Chee, an attorney who mostly represents landlords, said some cases are being kept out of court because tenants are choosing to leave their units without fighting the eviction. “A lot of tenants have just run away,” Chee said. “So once the moratoriums were done, a lot of tenants, as soon as they figured out their landlords were going to evict them, just simply left.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday that he wants to use federal coronavirus relief money to increase day care capacity to help alleviate the state’s worker shortage. The Republican governor, in a speech about the future of work that was followed by several questions, said expanding day care could help get more workers back in the workforce. Idaho’s current unemployment rate of 2.9% puts the state back at pre-pandemic levels last seen in early 2020, a span that includes a period of double-digit unemployment as COVID-19 spread and jobs evaporated. But now, many employers can’t find enough workers. “We know part of that is parents who are staying home,” Little said. “We think we can take some one-time money and build some (day care) capacity.” The U.S. Department of Labor has said the national unemployment rate last month dropped from 5.2% to 4.8%. Officials said 194,000 people found work, a tepid number and evidence that the pandemic remained a problem, with many companies struggling to fill millions of open jobs. Idaho has had problems with the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant, with the state currently on crisis standards of care due to so many unvaccinated patients filling hospitals. Crisis care standards mean scarce resources such as intensive care beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The head of a police union has called on its members to defy the city’s requirement to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday or be placed on unpaid leave. In the video posted online Tuesday and first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara vowed to take Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to court if it tries to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by the end of the workweek. After Friday, unvaccinated workers who won’t submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing will be placed on unpaid leave. Catanzara suggested that if the city does enforce its requirement, and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up.” In the video, Catanzara instructs officers to file for exemptions to receiving the vaccine but not to enter that information into the city’s vaccine portal. He said that although he has made clear his vaccine status, “I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody, let alone that information about your medical history.” During a news conference Wednesday, Lightfoot accused Cantazara of spreading false information and dismissed most of his statements as “untrue or patently false.”\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Monroe County officials are buying part of a site dotted with old limestone quarries for a possible tourist destination despite chemical contamination found in the area. The Monroe County Council this past week approve the $370,000 purchase of nearly 30 acres near Bloomington just northwest of the Interstate 69 and Indiana 46 interchange. County leaders have discussed over the past couple years buying about 100 acres of wooded former quarry property with the idea of building trails, exhibits about the limestone industry and an outdoor concert venue. Tests by an Indiana University researcher have found low contamination levels of polychlorinated biphenyls in sections of the quarry site not yet purchased by the county. Several sites around Bloomington contaminated with the toxic industrial chemicals have faced multimillion-dollar cleanups since the 1980s. County Council member Kate Wiltz said the proposed park project could acknowledge the negative impact of industrial pollution on the community while being a tribute to the area’s limestone heritage. “I think that’s a side of parks and public lands that we don’t often promote, but that’s every bit as important reason to purchase and steward the property,” Wiltz said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: With the threat of a United Auto Workers strike looming, Deere & Co. managers told employees at factories across the state not to come in Wednesday. Workers said managers ordered third-shift employees in Waterloo not to report to work at their usual 11 p.m. start time. Employees at the company’s Ankeny and Ottumwa plants said Deere also canceled their second shifts. Employees are working under a contract that expires Friday, but the UAW told Deere that its 10,100 members will go on strike Thursday morning if the two sides cannot reach a tentative agreement. Workers have not gone on strike against Deere since 1986. UAW International spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said Wednesday that his team was looking into reports of temporary layoffs. “We’ve gotten no formal notification about anything,” he said. In addition to plants in Ankeny, Ottumwa and Waterloo, the UAW represents Deere workers in Davenport and Dubuque, as well as in Illinois and Kansas. The Waterloo plant, with about 3,000 members, is Deere’s largest. On Sunday, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a proposed six-year contract with Deere that would have raised wages and bolstered current employees’ retirement payments while ending traditional pensions for new hires, who would participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has passed an ordinance aimed at banning discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. After four months of delays, the council voted 6-1 to approve the measure Tuesday, the Wichita Eagle reports. Council member Jeff Blubaugh cast the lone dissenting vote. Council members rejected a proposed exemption that would have allowed religious groups to fire or refuse to hire LGBTQ individuals, an amendment proposed by council member Jared Cerullo, the first openly gay man to serve on the council. Cerullo said the proposed amendment would help bridge the divide between religious groups who opposed it and those who wanted it. But council members Becky Tuttle and Cindy Claycomb said it would “dilute” the ordinance. The measure seeks to prohibit discrimination based on age, color, disability, familial status, gender identity, genetic information, national origin or ancestry, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, citizenship, veteran status or any other factor protected by law. The city will begin accepting complaints under the ordinance Jan. 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the influential chairman of the House Budget Committee who has played a key role in pushing for President Joe Biden’s agenda to expand the nation’s social safety net, announced Tuesday that he will not seek another term in next year’s election. At age 74, Yarmuth – first elected to Congress in 2006, when he unseated a Republican incumbent in his Louisville-area district – said he wanted to spend more time with his family. The congressman is the 10th Democrat to announce plans to retire ahead of the 2022 election. Although the district he represents has become increasingly blue, the retirement of a Democrat in a senior leadership position sends yet another ominous sign about the party’s chances heading into next year’s midterms, when its thin majority in both U.S. chambers will be at stake. The party that wins control of the White House typically loses congressional seats in subsequent elections. Yarmuth is the only Democrat in Kentucky’s six-member U.S. House delegation. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top-ranking Democrat in the GOP-controlled state Senate, quickly announced he’d run for the seat. State Rep. Attica Scott was already waging a primary challenge against Yarmuth, and his son, Aaron Yarmuth, said he is weighing throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billionaire Richard Branson said it was an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime experience to don a drum major’s uniform and march ahead of a New Orleans high school band. But some of the Catholic school’s fans apparently were less enthusiastic about Branson’s appearance last week with the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 – the band that integrated an exclusive Mardi Gras parade. The band and Branson paraded to a new Virgin Hotel in New Orleans as part of opening ceremonies Thursday. “I’ve had quite a few exciting experiences in my time, but I’ve never got (a) chance to lead a marching band before – let alone the best marching band in the world,” Branson wrote on his blog Friday. “What an honour to join the legendary St. Augustine High School band for a performance through the streets of New Orleans.” Aulston G. Taylor, president and CEO of the school, tweeted a letter late Sunday acknowledging that many people had told him only students who have earned it should be allowed to wear the purple and gold uniform. Others felt that “Sir Branson adorning our drum major uniform with honor across his millions of followers was great for the school and sets us apart as a global brand,” he wrote. He said both viewpoints are valid.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Republicans in the state Senate want to return to taxpayers a portion of the surplus that accumulated during the pandemic, thanks in part to historic federal assistance. The “Give It Back” plan is seen as a major piece of the GOP’s messaging push ahead of the 2022 legislative session and comes as former Republican Gov. Paul LePage seeks to unseat current Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, the Bangor Daily News reports. The plan calls for splitting unused monthly revenue, sending half to the state’s rainy day fund and half to taxpaying residents. The proposal is in line with LePage’s campaign promise of eliminating Maine’s income tax if he wins in 2022. Mills has overseen a healthy state budget during her time as governor despite higher spending. A spokesperson for her administration called the GOP proposal a tacit acknowledgement of the state’s good fiscal situation under Mills’ leadership, according to the newspaper. Maine Republican legislators have fought with Mills over the $1 billion in federal relief that was used to bail state government out during the pandemic. Party leaders have called the aid excessive.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city’s public schools are using software that alerts officials when a student using one of the system’s laptops might be considering suicide. Since March, GoGuardian’s Beacon software has identified nine students as having a severe mental health crisis. All were taken to an emergency room, Stacey Davis, the city schools’ coordinator of media and instructional technology, told The Baltimore Sun. But the practice, which came about as the system loaned out laptops for students’ home use during the pandemic, is raising questions about privacy and equity. Two recent reports warn that such technology could be used for disciplinary purposes, unintentionally out LGBTQ students or squash student expression. They also note that economically disadvantaged students may be tracked more frequently because school-owned laptops may be their only devices. “Privacy and equity was not being considered as much as it needs to be,” said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington and co-author of one of the reports. “Student activity monitoring is quite widespread.” Baltimore schools have gotten 786 alerts from Beacon since March. Of those, clinicians responded 401 times, and school police went to homes 12 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBarnstable: A rare two-headed diamondback terrapin turtle is alive and kicking – with all six of its legs – at the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center after hatching a little over two weeks ago. A threatened species in the state, this turtle is feeding well on bloodworms and food pellets, staff at the center said. The two heads operate independently, coming up for air at different times, and inside its shell are two gastrointestinal systems to feed both sides of its body. The turtle originally came from a nest in West Barnstable that researchers determined was in a hazardous location and needed to be moved. After hatching, turtles in these so-called head start nests are sent to different care centers to be monitored before their release in the spring. Center veterinarian Pria Patel and other staff members will continue to monitor the turtle, which they nicknamed Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen after the twins who rose to prominence as child actors, beginning with “Full House” in 1987 when they were babies, and now are the famously elusive designers behind fashion label The Row. The staff is hoping to perform a CT scan to learn more about the turtle’s circulatory system.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Backers of former President Donald Trump will launch a ballot drive to require a “full forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election, rallygoers were told Tuesday. Jon Rocha, of Portage, a Republican who is running against U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, said he expects paperwork for the legislative initiative to be filed with the Board of State Canvassers next week. “This is how a revolution begins,” Rocha told several hundred people gathered on the state Capitol lawn. If about 340,000 valid signatures are collected, and the measure is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, “it is absolutely veto-proof,” Rocha said. “That’s the best part about it.” Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “cannot stop this bill.” Should lawmakers fail to act on the measure, it would go to voters at the November 2022 election, he said. Though ill-defined, a “forensic audit” is the phrase that has been embraced by large numbers of people unhappy with the result of the 2020 presidential election, in which President Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump, a Republican. Biden won 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and by more than 7 million popular votes. Biden prevailed in Michigan by more than 150,000 votes. Several private donors have agreed to help fund the effort, Rocha said. He would not name them.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Moccasin maker Minnetonka is publicly apologizing for making money off Native American culture and promised to do more to support Indigenous communities in the future after 75 years in business. In a statement posted Monday on Minnetonka’s website, CEO David Miller said the company is not a Native-owned business. He noted the Minneapolis-based firm acknowledged its appropriation in summer 2020 but said this public apology was long overdue. “We deeply and meaningfully apologize for having benefited from selling Native-inspired designs without directly honoring Native culture or communities,” Miller said. The company timed the apology to coincide with Indigenous Peoples Day. To better address the needs of the Native American community, Minnetonka said it has hired Adrienne Benjamin – a Minnesotan, Anishinaabe, and a member of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe – as a reconciliation advisor. The company said it’s also making a concerted effort to improve diversity, equity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and will seek out more partnerships with Native-owned businesses as vendors and suppliers. In the past year, it has done business with two different Native-owned companies, the company said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Students who left college at least two years ago without a degree can apply for a grant to help them return to and finish school. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recently awarded the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning $1.3 million to fund the state’s Complete 2 Compete tuition assistance grants through 2023. The Complete 2 Compete program provides one-on-one support for adult learners who have earned college credits – but not a degree – and works with them to complete their education. Qualifying returning students can receive a $1,000 grant that can be renewed every semester. The award helps pay for any coursework needed to graduate and can help repay prior debt. Funds can be used at any Mississippi public universities or community colleges. A total of 2,400 students have graduated since the program launched in 2017. More than 200,000 prior students qualify for the Complete 2 Compete program, according to a press release from the Mississippi Community College Board. Since May, the program has reached out to former students through postcards as well as internet and social media ads. More than 2,700 former students’ applications were processed over the summer, with 620 returning to enroll in one of 15 community colleges, eight universities and a medical center.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has struck down the state’s requirement that a majority of the owners of companies that dispense, grow or manufacture marijuana must be Missouri residents. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey last week issued a permanent injunction against the residency requirement, The Kansas City Star reports. She had issued a temporary injunction in June. Missouri voters approved creation of a medical marijuana industry in the state in 2018. One of the regulations required that state-licensed marijuana cultivation plants, dispensaries and manufacturing facilities must be at least 51% owned by people who had lived in Missouri for at least one year. Mark Toigo, a Pennsylvania-based investor, filed a lawsuit last December challenging the requirement, arguing that it violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. Lisa Cox, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said in a statement that the agency is “happy to have clarity on how we should handle the ownership residency requirement in the Missouri Constitution and will comply with the court’s decision.” The health department oversees the medical marijuana program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawsuit filed Tuesday is challenging a new state law banning voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in certain areas of college campuses. The lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party, Montanans for Tester and University of Montana student Macee Patritti is one of several challenging the law passed by the Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year. The plaintiffs argue the law is suppressing the vote of young people, who typically favor Democratic candidates. The law prohibits political committees including student organizations from conducting voter registration drives and other political activities inside certain high-traffic public university spaces including residence halls, dining facilities and athletic facilities. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Missoula argues the law “imposes arbitrary, vague, and onerous restrictions on the rights of college students” to participate fully in the political process. Patritti, a 19-year-old freshman, registered students to vote at the Montana Technological University in Butte as an intern with the Montana Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 election, according to the court filing. The plaintiffs argue that her First Amendment rights to political expression would be curtailed under the new law, which would prohibit such activities.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has announced a five-year ban on Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for student conduct code violations following a report of a sexual assault at the fraternity’s house in August. The report led to a protest of about 1,000 people outside the fraternity house Aug. 25 and sparked similar protests on college campuses around the country. The UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta – better known as Fiji – was temporarily suspended in late August while the university investigated possible violations of a previous probation. The university said Tuesday in a news release that an investigation by the University Conduct Board showed violations had occurred and that Fiji is no longer recognized by the university. The fraternity is suspended from the Lincoln campus at least through 2026, the release said. Fiji was already on probation for previous violations of university policy when the assault was reported. That report is still being actively investigated by the University Police Department, according to the university.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state’s top election official is challenging the status of two ballot measures that Nevada’s largest teachers union promised to withdraw after successfully using them as bargaining chips and pressuring legislators to boost education funding. In a Sept. 7 letter first published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske wrote that state law required she include measures that propose raising taxes on sales and gambling on the 2022 ballot. Neither Democrats nor Nevada’s powerful resort industry want the tax measures to appear before voters next year, both have said. Democrats worry their inclusion could allow Republicans to frame the election around taxes. And resorts and casinos do not want to risk a hike that could deter tourists from visiting Las Vegas. The initiatives originated almost a year ago, when the Clark County Education Association submitted the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to qualify the two proposals for the 2022 ballot. John Vellardita, the teachers union’s executive director, said in March that the measures were designed to “start a conversation” about education funding and said they’d remain on the ballot unless lawmakers increased education funding before adjourning in June, which they did.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday rejected $27 million in federal funds for vaccination outreach, thrilling outspoken activists who previously derailed a public meeting and delayed the vote. Several were arrested Wednesday after audience members repeatedly interrupted the debate. Among other things, the money would have allowed the state to hire a public health manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccines and address public concerns about them. Opponents argued the grant language would have required the state to comply with any “future directives” issued by the Biden administration regarding COVID-19, such as vaccine mandates. The same language has appeared in other grants accepted by the council, a five-member body that approves state contracts. And it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty, said both Attorney General John Formella and Republican Gov. Chris Sununu. “I appreciate that you have concerns, but they’re based on fantasy,” Sununu told Councilor Joe Kenney. All four of the Republican councilors voted against the grants. “You want the government to tell private businesses who to hire and fire?” the governor said. “That is completely un-American.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: The state has awarded a contract to replace a century-old rail bridge that has been the source of regular delays for years, officials announced Tuesday. The $1.56 billion contract is the largest in NJ Transit’s history, CEO Kevin Corbett said in a statement. The board of directors approved a joint venture by Sweden-based Skanska and Traylor Brothers, a civil construction company based in Evansville, Indiana. Construction is expected to take about five years. The Portal North Bridge is to replace a 111-year-old swing bridge over the Hackensack River that occasionally becomes stuck after it opens to allow boats to pass and must be manually hammered back into place. The new bridge will allow marine traffic to pass underneath without interrupting rail traffic. The project completed its design phase and received environmental approvals several years ago but languished while New York and New Jersey officials squabbled with the Trump administration over dividing up the costs between the states and the federal government. “Few infrastructure projects are as critical to the nation as replacing the aging Portal Bridge,” Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: After seven years of mining, federal officials say work to carve out the eighth disposal area at the U.S. government’s underground nuclear waste repository is complete. Managers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are planning to use the space beginning next year. Workers still need to run power to the excavated area known as Panel 8 and install air monitors and chain link to protect the walls. Constructed in a deep layer of salt in southern New Mexico, the repository entombs the radioactive remnants of decades of nuclear research and bomb-making. That includes special boxes and barrels packed with lab coats, rubber gloves, tools and debris contaminated with plutonium and other radioactive elements. Having enough space for the waste became more of an issue in 2014, when a radiation release contaminated parts of the underground facility and forced an expensive, nearly three-year closure. Some parts of the repository became off-limits. State regulators currently are weighing a permit change that some critics say could open the door to expanded operations at the repository. A decision is expected this year. In operation for more than two decades, the repository has received nearly 13,000 shipments. The idea is that the shifting salt will eventually encapsulate the waste after the underground vaults are filled and sealed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A $2 billion project to build a rail link to LaGuardia Airport was officially put on hold Tuesday, after weeks of criticism from public officials and a lawsuit from neighborhood and environmental groups. In a news release, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it is pausing the project to consider alternatives. In recent weeks, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had criticized the project, championed by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo. Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who represents part of the area through which the link would pass, also has spoken out against it, as has outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio. The Federal Aviation Administration issued environmental approval in July but recently had asked the Port Authority to reconsider in light of a lawsuit filed by neighborhood and environmental groups. Preliminary construction on the roughly $2 billion, 1.5-mile elevated link was to begin this year. Public transit officials have sought for years to build a rail link to LaGuardia, one of the few major U.S. airports without rail service. Critics had opposed the plan, saying it would negatively impact Queens neighborhoods and wouldn’t be appreciably faster than driving, as it would involve taking a train or subway from points east or west to a stop serving CitiField, home of the New York Mets, then switching to the rail link.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A jail violated regulations requiring guards to observe inmates at least twice an hour, according to a state agency probing the deaths of two inmates last spring. On May 22, John Devin Haley, 41, of Charlotte, was found hanging below his cell window at the Mecklenburg County jail with a strip of blanket tied around his neck, The Charlotte Observer reports. Haley had a history of addiction and mental health problems when he entered the jail April 3 and was temporarily placed on suicide watch, according to jail records. Karon Golightly of Gastonia died at the jail May 14. Five months later, the cause of his death has not been made public, the newspaper reports. In North Carolina, jailers are required to observe each inmate “at least twice an hour on an irregular basis, with no more than 40 minutes between rounds,” according to state regulations. That standard was repeatedly violated in the hours leading up to the two deaths, according to investigators with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. A DHHS report obtained by the newspaper says 52 minutes elapsed between the time Golightly was seen healthy and being discovered in distress in another inmate’s cell. The state also pointed to a camera near where Golightly collapsed that apparently was malfunctioning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Budget writers in the Legislature began mulling proposals Tuesday on how to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in federal coronavirus aid the state received this year. House and Senate appropriations committees met separately in all-day meetings at the Capitol, listening to pitches from fellow lawmakers and others on a wish list that totaled $9.2 billion – significantly more than the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota in June. The meetings, attended heavily by lobbyists, were the first in a series being held this month to prioritize projects ahead of a Nov. 8 special session, when the full GOP-led Legislature will debate the proposals. The $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus funds represents the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history. The money currently is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest. Senate Appropriations Chairman Ray Holmberg and his counterpart in the House, Jeff Delzer, said priority for the funding will be given to water, sewer and infrastructure projects, for which there is an immediate need, and those that won’t require a commitment of funds from taxpayers in the future.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recreational marijuana would be legalized for adults 21 and older under Republican legislation coming in the state House that would levy a 10% sales tax on the product, a lawmaker announced Tuesday. Ohio facilities currently producing and processing medical marijuana would be grandfathered into the program, with new producers to be added to meet the expected demand, said Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Lake County. He said he’s currently looking for co-sponsors for the legislation, which has been in the works for months. The bill “is the responsible approach for adult use,” Callender said. A quarter of the sales tax revenue would go to police departments to purchase equipment used in detecting impaired drivers and another quarter toward addiction and recovery programs. The remaining 50% would not be earmarked, which could help the state during a precarious economic time, Callender said. In addition to the legislation being announced Tuesday, a separate ballot issue to legalize marijuana use and sales in Ohio is underway. A spokesperson for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which proposed that statute, said Tuesday that the group applauded Callender’s plan and said it continues to welcome the chance to work with the Legislature on passing a recreational marijuana bill.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A retired New York attorney is suing the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, saying its claim to have no records pertaining to the drugs it plans to use in upcoming executions “defies belief.” Fred Hodara, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Oklahoma County District Court, is asking the court to compel the corrections department to comply with his open records requests for documentation of its execution plans. He said in his lawsuit that in response to his requests for the records, including some the department is legally required to keep, the department told him none exist, the Tulsa World reports. “In light of the scope and nature of the requests, the assertation defies belief,” the lawsuit said, arguing that the agency has a history of refusing to search for and produce records that are subject to the state’s Open Records Act. A department spokesman told the newspaper that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Oklahoma is preparing to execute John Marion Grant on Oct. 28. It would be the state’s first execution since 2015, when then-Gov. Mary Fallin put a moratorium on capital punishment following the execution of Charles Warner with a drug that wasn’t authorized to be used that way.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Republican state lawmaker Bill Post has announced his resignation from the Legislature after saying he misunderstood the residency requirements for being in office when he moved out of Oregon. His resignation announced Tuesday will be effective Nov. 30. Post previously said he wouldn’t seek reelection in 2022 but said Tuesday that he would resign after “discussions with an elections attorney.” Post, a former talk radio host, has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2015. He and his wife moved to Fallon, Nevada, which is east of Reno. In a Sept. 27 Facebook message, Post said his wife accepted a job, and they had sold their Keizer house and bought one in Fallon. He said he’d be in the district “at least once per month.” “My intent was to be open with my constituents about my move out of state and the steps I’d be taking to continue to fulfill my duties for the rest of my term to the best of my knowledge and ability,” Post said in a statement. Republican precinct committee members from House District 25 will select three to five candidates to replace Post. County commissioners from Marion and Yamhill counties will then choose a candidate to serve out the remainder of Post’s term. A Republican has held the seat since 2003.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Love was unexpectedly on the court docket when a man accused of murder made an unusual request of the judge who will preside over his trial. Kashawn Flowers’ lawyer on Tuesday asked York County Judge Harry Ness whether he’d consider marrying Flowers and his girlfriend. Attorney Brian Perry acknowledged it was the first time he had ever made such a request. Flowers is accused of gunning down a man in York in August 2014. His girlfriend would not be a witness at the trial, his attorney said. Prosecutors did not object, and neither did the judge. But the marriage is on hold until after the trial. “We’ll take care of it next week,” the judge said. Flowers remains held in the county jail without bail.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A series of controversial murals at a school have been painted over following criticism that they depicted children of color in a disparaging light. Among the four painted panels at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary School, only one shows children with different skin tones together, while the others show varying races separated. Two white children are shown playing on a beach in one scene, while two Black children build a snowman in another. Meanwhile, in a separate image, other children of color tidy up the school and collect trash. City Councilman David Salvatore said he received complaints about the murals, focusing in part on their apparent themes of inequality and segregation, and held community meetings on the issue. Initially, Salvatore explored the idea of removing the murals, preserving them and putting them on display, though he said it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. Eventually, the murals were painted over just before the school year began. Considerations for a new mural will be made. The city’s decision generated backlash from state Rep. Anastasia Williams, who said the paintings represented desegregation and anti-racism to her. Officials have been unable to find any mention of the murals in city archives; it’s only known that they were painted decades ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two civil rights groups are suing the state, saying lawmakers are taking too long to draw new maps for U.S. and state House districts. Candidates are required to file to run for the 2022 races by the end of March, but time is running out for potential candidates to research the new districts and settle any lawsuits asking judges to decide if the new maps are fair, according to the suit. It was filed Tuesday by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union. The groups are asking a panel of three federal judges to set a specific timeline for maps to be drawn and approved and not allow any elections until the new districts get judicial approval. The suit said lawmakers should have kept to suggestions when they adjourned in June that there would be a special session in September or October to approve maps. Those plans became less firm as lawmakers dealt with the aftermath of a budget provision that prevented districts from passing mask requirements this school year. South Carolina Senate President Harvey Peeler called for an Oct. 12 special session last month but canceled it about a week later, saying a committee working on the school district issues wouldn’t be finished in time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Zoo officials say COVID-19 may have killed a snow leopard. The animal, named Baya, died at the Great Plains Zoo on Thursday of a respiratory illness that might have been COVID-19. Coronavirus test results are pending. The snow leopard began coughing Oct. 3. By Oct. 4 she was acting lethargic and wouldn’t eat. Zoo veterinarians gave Baya antibiotics Thursday, but she was in critical condition later in the day. Baya was 21/ 2 years old and had been at the zoo since early 2021. Officials had hoped she would mate with another snow leopard named Strut. Zoo officials said Monday that an Amur tiger at the zoo tested positive for the virus Oct. 6, the day before Baya died. Five other big cats at the zoo have shown COVID-19 symptoms, including Strut. Most of the animals have been on antibiotics and are improving, said Matt Eschenbrenner, the zoo’s director of animal care and conservation. He said the zoo hopes to bring in another snow leopard to replace Baya, but it’s unclear when that animal might arrive. “We can’t even think about bringing in another animal until we know everything has passed and our animals are healthy, 100%,” Eschenbrenner said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Three U.S. Postal Service workers died in a shooting spree at a sorting facility Tuesday, including a supervisor, a manager and a letter carrier temporarily assigned to the postal annex, relatives and co-workers said. Two workers were fatally shot by a third who died from a self-inflicted gunshot, authorities said. The FBI and U.S. Postal Service didn’t immediately name those involved. The postal facility reopened Wednesday. Laquita Benjamin, president of the local branch of the National Association of Postal Supervisors, said those killed were a carrier, a supervisor and a manager. “You can’t just relate it to the Postal Service because you have school shootings, store shootings – you have shootings all over,” Benjamin said. A family member identified one of the dead as James Wilson, a manager at the East Lamar Carrier Annex in Orange Mound, a historic Memphis neighborhood. “He was a humble soul, one of the nicest supervising managers you could ever wish there was,” Roxanne Rogers said of Wilson, her cousin. Rogers, herself a postal worker, said Wilson had just returned to the annex after filling in at a different location. Melvin Richardson, president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 96, said the annex is only used by employees.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday launched an investigation into allegations of widespread mistreatment at the state’s embattled youth lockups, where at least 11 staffers have been arrested on sexual abuse charges in recent years. The move by the Biden administration is the latest sign of trouble for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which for more than a decade has been beset by scandal, staff shake-ups and investigations into allegations of abuse. Just last week, a former coach at a West Texas facility was arrested on charges alleging that he touched the breast of an 18-year-old in custody. The announcement comes a year after advocates in Texas filed a complaint with federal investigators that outlined “grave problems” at the state’s five youth lockups. Texas put more than 800 youths in state juvenile detention in 2019 – more than any other state – according to an agency report published in September. “Being subjected to harmful conditions does not rehabilitate children; it only leads to worse life outcomes,” said Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Spokespeople for the state agency and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In July, Abbott ordered a new investigation into the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Apple CEO Tim Cook and NBA All-Star Dwayne Wade joined Utah leaders Wednesday to announce the completion of a local advocacy group’s campaign to build new homes that provide services for LGBTQ youth in the West. Encircle, a nonprofit providing mental health services for LGBTQ youth, has surpassed its goal of raising $8 million to build eight new homes with locations in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Utah aimed at providing safe spaces and preventing teen suicide. “Encircle’s mission is very personal to me because I see myself in so many of these young people,” Cook told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. “It’s not easy when you’re made to feel different or less than because of who you are or who you love. It’s a feeling that so many LGBTQ people know far too well.” Wade, who joined the Utah Jazz ownership group in April, shared his experience as the parent of a transgender child and voiced his support for Encircle’s mission. “I stand here as a proud parent of a beautiful daughter that’s a part of the LGBT+ community,” Wade said. “I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know everything, but I’m willing to listen.”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A dam built at the end of the 18th century has been fully removed after it was abandoned and contributed to flooding that threatened nearby homes in central Vermont. The removal of the Dunklee Pond dam started in 2019 and was completed in the past month, WCAX-TV reports. In the decades after it was built, the dam powered industries including a linseed oil mill, a wood planing mill, a metal mill, a slate pencil mill and a tannery, the broadcaster reports. More recently, it was used as a skating rink and swimming hole. “In the ’50s, ’60s, there were photos of the people diving, jumping off the dam, off the wall up here, swimming, fishing,” said Todd Menees of the Vermont Rivers Program. But the dam deteriorated, and Rutland City Fire Chief Bill Lovett said if it failed, it would have threatened dozens of homes downstream, and a bridge over a busy roadway could have been destroyed. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and the city of Rutland coordinated the project, using about $500,000 of state and federal funding. The project removed sediment that accumulated behind the dam, which the city of Rutland will use for road repairs.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The family of a slain journalist is asking the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Facebook for failing to remove online footage of her shooting death. Andy Parker said the company is violating its own terms of service in hosting videos on Facebook and its sibling service, Instagram, that glorify violence. His daughter, TV news reporter Alison Parker, and cameraman Adam Ward were killed by a former co-worker while reporting for Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV in August 2015. Video footage of the shooting – some of which was taken by the gunman – repeatedly resurfaces on Facebook and Instagram despite assurances from top executives that it will be removed, according to a complaint filed Tuesday by Parker and attorneys with the Georgetown Law Civil Rights Clinic. “The reality is that Facebook and Instagram put the onus on victims and their families to do the policing of graphic content – requiring them to relive their worst moments over and over to curb the proliferation of these videos,” the complaint said. It said Facebook is engaging in deceptive trade practices by violating its own terms of service and misrepresenting the safety of the platform and how hard it is for users to get harmful and traumatic content removed.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The pace of the 20-acre Rattlesnake Ridge landslide in central Washington near Union Gap is continuing to slow, officials said. Yakima County emergency services director Tony Miller said measurements taken in August show the slab is moving less than 2 inches each week, The Yakima Herald-Republic reports. In 2020, the slab was sliding 2 to 3 inches each week. The slab is expected to continue sliding south, with debris depositing in a nearby quarry. “It’s moving a little bit, crumbling and falling right into the pit,” Miller said. State and county officials, as well as scientists, have been monitoring the slide since a crack was spotted on the ridge in 2017. Initially, officials said the slide could pose an immediate danger, and 60 people living nearby were evacuated. Some residents returned after an assessment firm hired by the state confirmed the landslide was not likely to rapidly slip. Stephen Reidel, a research faculty member at Washington State University, said the slab is sliding on a sedimentary layer between basalt flows. As the basalt slides into the quarry, it will stack up and eventually build up enough to act as a barrier, stopping the landslide. “It’ll just stabilize itself and then stop moving,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Employers would be limited in their ability to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under a bill introduced by Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday. The proposal, which would allow certain medical and religious exemptions to company vaccine mandates, comes as the state approaches 4,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Employers would be barred under the bill from penalizing or discriminating against current or prospective employees for pursuing the exemptions. The bill, which covers businesses and state government agencies, was advanced in the state Senate on first reading Wednesday. In the House of Delegates, it was referred to a committee. Justice, a Republican, lifted an earlier indoor mask mandate in June and opposes any new mask or vaccine mandates. Businesses can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine, “but at the same time they need to allow for these exemptions,” Justice said at a news conference. Under the bill, a doctor or nurse can provide signed documentation that the employee has a physical condition preventing them from safely receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or that the worker has recovered from COVID-19 and can show they have antibodies for the coronavirus. The worker also can present a notarized certification for a religious exemption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans brought in rocker and avid hunter Ted Nugent on Wednesday to publicize a package of bills that would declare open hunting season on sandhill cranes and allow anyone 18 or older to carry concealed firearms without a permit. Nugent appeared with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, including state Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, inside the Assembly chamber. The musician and conservative activist said that “hunting is essential, and any regulation that doesn’t deal with safety or science-based wildlife management is an obstacle to participation.” The package of 13 bills is making its way through the Republican-controlled Legislature. Even if they passed, to become law they would need the approval of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who would likely veto many of them. Nugent, who lives in neighboring Michigan, is the national spokesman for Hunter Nation, a group that outraged conservationists when it won a court order forcing an unprecedented late-winter wolf hunt in Wisconsin during the animal’s breeding season. The proposal to create a sandhill crane hunting season mirrors another that died in 2012 in home state of the International Crane Foundation. Nugent said in addition to population control, sandhills are tasty. “Are you familiar with the term ribeye?” he said. “They’re ribeyes in the sky.”\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Trustees at the University of Wyoming say they’ll continue a policy requiring masks in indoor campus spaces where social distance can’t be maintained, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Only about 40% of students have confirmed COVID-19 vaccinations, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/07/anti-racism-art-speedway-shot-sweetener-pharrell-vs-va-beach-news-around-states/119027036/", "title": "Anti-racism art, speedway shot sweetener: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The first capital of the Confederacy has renamed a street honoring the rebel president to recognize a Black civil rights lawyer instead, defying a state law meant to protect Confederate monuments and memorials. The Montgomery City Council voted Tuesday night to rename Jeff Davis Avenue for attorney Fred D. Gray, who grew up on the street during the Jim Crow era and went on to represent clients including Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. “When I think of heroes who exemplify the best in our city, (Gray) is certainly at the forefront of that,” said Mayor Steven Reed, Montgomery’s first Black mayor. He initially proposed the change in December. The City Council’s unanimous approval could prompt a $25,000 fine under an Alabama law passed in 2017 to prevent the removal or alteration of Confederate monuments, which have been challenged and taken down across the South, but Reed said donors already had offered to pay the penalty for the city, where delegates voted to form the Confederacy in 1861. Gray, 90, still practices law in Tuskegee, located east of Montgomery, and said the city had kept him informed. “This is a project of the mayor’s,” he said. “He expressed it to me. I was very happy about it. And I am very happy about it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Citing an increase in rude, violent behavior in schools, the city’s superintendent wants parents to help address the problem with children. The bad behavior has included a fight at a high school that prompted a large police response, along with a TikTok challenge in which students caused thousands of dollars in damage to school bathrooms, KTUU-TV reports. Superintendent Deena Bishop said the pandemic may be behind the behavior. “We are just finding, more and more, our young people, our children, are mostly as stressed out as the rest of us,” Bishop said. “And the stress and the anxiety in the community has taken effect. And we just want to work with our parents to find solutions to this.” The state’s largest school district has recorded nearly 800 suspensions this year, most at the secondary level. Officials say while that’s not necessarily a high number, the severity of the incidents has increased, including fights, assaults, and drug and alcohol issues. Teachers also report younger children seem to have lost the coping skills they need to calm down, Bishop said. In a recent newsletter, she asked parents to intervene after students in many incidents lacked respect and patience. “If you are seeing it at home, guess what’s happening in our schools,” Bishop said of the bad behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nFountain Hills: Beaten in his last three elections, former six-term Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is attempting another comeback, this time running for mayor of the affluent Phoenix suburb where he has lived for the past two decades. The former lawman on Tuesday announced his entry in the 2022 mayor’s race in Fountain Hills, a town of about 25,000. After getting crushed by a Democratic challenger in 2016 after 24 years as sheriff, Arpaio finished third in a Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018 and second in the GOP primary in his 2020 bid to win back the sheriff’s post. In both comeback attempts, Arpaio lost the vote in Fountain Hills. In an interview, he said his last comeback bids failed because he entered those races too late in the election cycle, and his early entry in the mayor’s race is an attempt to avoid the same fate. He rejected criticism that he should walk away from public life. The 89-year-old said he remains in good health and wants to push a pro-business agenda on behalf of the town. Arpaio was voted out as sheriff in 2016 amid voter frustration over his headline-grabbing tactics and legal troubles, including his disobedience of a judge’s 2011 order to stop his large-scale traffic patrols targeting immigrants that led to his 2017 criminal contempt of court conviction, which was pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Elizabeth Eckford, one of the nine Black students who first integrated Central High School in 1957, celebrated her 80th birthday at the school with the help of about a dozen students. The teens, members of the Civil Rights Memory Project, lined the sidewalk in front of the high school Monday, holding handwritten signs. “It’s an honor to be here to celebrate with her because she did so much for our school,” Destiny Logan, a senior, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The number of students participating was kept small, and they were told not to clap or make loud noises, as they gathered outside the same school where an angry mob of protesters had met Eckford and eight other Black students in 1957. After President Dwight Eisenhower ordered federal troops to protect the nine students, they began their first full day on Sept. 25, 1957. Images of the nine Black teens became among the most indelible of the civil rights movement, including one of Eckford calmly walking into school as a teen girl behind her shouts. A teacher sang “Amazing Grace,” and the students sang “Happy Birthday” to Eckford. Students and other guests took turns taking pictures with her and telling her stories. “It was the best birthday I had in a long, long time,” Eckford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: City leaders on Wednesday approved one of the nation’s strictest vaccine mandates – a sweeping measure that requires the shots for everyone entering bars, restaurants, nail salons, gyms or even a Lakers game. The City Council voted 11-2 in favor of the ordinance that will require proof of full vaccination starting Nov. 4. The move came after the council postponed a vote last week to deal with concerns ranging from who could be fined for violations to whether employees could end up in fistfights when they have to serve as vaccine door monitors. Some critics charge that a mandate would amount to segregation of those who cannot or refuse to be vaccinated. Others call it unenforceable. Business trade groups have said the city mandate will sow confusion because Los Angeles County’s own vaccine rules – which apply both in Los Angeles and in surrounding communities – are less sweeping. However, council members who support the ordinance said it is aimed at reducing the risk of new coronavirus case surges. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who’s expected to sign the ordinance into law, said last week: “I don’t want to bury another city employee, police officer, firefighter.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A health system fired 119 employees for not adhering to its vaccine requirement without a religious or medical exemption. That accounts for less than 0.5% of the company’s 26,500 employees around the state, said UCHealth spokesperson Dan Weaver. UCHealth employees had until Oct. 1 to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or apply for and receive an exemption. Among those fired, 54 employees were from the Denver region, 33 from northern Colorado and 32 from the southern part of the state. Nearly 1,170 medical and religious exemptions were approved, for about 4% of the workforce, Weaver said. “Despite the loss of these employees, UCHealth’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement has helped to improve staffing. With broad vaccination rates, fewer employees are testing positive for COVID-19 and needing to be out of work while they recover,” he said in an email. The employees who were terminated are welcome and encouraged to reapply if they receive one of the three approved COVID-19 vaccinations, Weaver said. UCHealth is a nonprofit health care system with 12 hospitals and hundreds of medical clinics in the Rocky Mountain region.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A private high school’s president apologized Tuesday after cheerleaders from another school reported being subjected to racist taunts after a football game there. Sean Brennan, president of East Catholic High School, said an investigation has not been able to determine who was involved in the Sept. 24 incident, but the school has “no tolerance for derisive and unkind words or behavior directed at our own students or students from other schools.” In an open letter to the Montville High School community, he wrote: “I am deeply sorry this happened, and I promise you that we can and will do better.” A 16-year-old Black cheerleader from Montville reported two East Catholic football players used a racial epithet in telling her to go home after East Catholic won. Another cheerleader reported she also was subjected to racial slurs, and the cheerleaders had water thrown at them. Brennan had earlier issued a statement saying the school took the reports seriously but did not believe “anything inappropriate was said.” There have been daily protests outside East Catholic since the interaction was reported, and leaders from both schools met Sept. 29 to discuss it with Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference officials. The CIAC said both schools will send student representatives to a training session on sportsmanship.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Dover International Speedway is offering the chance to drive around its “Monster Mile” to people who get vaccinated against COVID-19 at the racetrack later this month. Up to 800 drivers and their passengers will be able to take two laps around the track in their own vehicles behind a pace car, according to a news release. Events will be held Oct. 16 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be offered. Participants will be able to get their first, second or booster shots. Free coronavirus testing will also be available, and people can get vaccinated at the events without driving the track. The first 250 people to sign up for vaccinations will receive two tickets to the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at the speedway April 30, 2022. Registration opened Wednesday at racetoendcovid.org. Appointments are encouraged, but walk-ups for testing and shots without driving the track will be accepted. Driving the track without signing up will only be available if the slots aren’t filled in advance. Drivers going around the track alone must be at least 18 and have a valid driver’s license, car registration in their name and vehicle insurance. Those who are 16 and 17 must have a license and a parent or guardian in the vehicle to sign a release form.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mourners and members of the public gathered on the Washington National Cathedral’s grounds Tuesday evening as its massive funeral bell tolled for America’s more than 700,000 COVID-19 victims, WUSA-TV reports. It was an astounding number – 700 plangent peals of the funeral bell, which was used before the pandemic to mourn the loss of presidents, senators, and luminaries of American life. Now, the bell tolls largely for those who chose to remain unvaccinated, six months after most Americans gained access to the lifesaving shots. “They don’t seem to realize the import of it until they themselves suffer a loss in their family,” said Zenaida Samaniego, who drove from Maryland to hear the hourlong ceremony. “The bells will toll again because of this hard-headedness about getting something that protects people.” With each bell symbolizing 1,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, disruptions and nonchalance were not lost on the mourners. A woman watching a YouTube video on her phone, at full volume, received glares until she got the message. “This must be moving us in a way I didn’t think it would,” said a woman who gave her name as Bess, describing the somber sense of hearing the bells from her Adams Morgan home. “I wish I could say this would be the end. But I don’t think it will be.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: The mansion that gangster Al Capone owned for nearly two decades – once fated to be demolished – just sold for $15.5 million. The Miami Herald reports the home was sold to 93 Palm Residence LLC, managed by Coral Gables accountant Toni Alam. Capone, the original “Scarface,” bought the waterfront house for $40,000 in 1928. He died there in 1947 from a heart attack. Developer Todd Michael Glaser and partner Nelson Gonzalez, senior vice president of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM, bought the nine-bedroom residence in August for $10.75 million with plans to demolish it and replace it with a more modern project. But preservationists in Miami Beach balked at their plans. Glaser compared the out-of-the-blue offer to a winning lottery ticket. “If someone tells you they want to give you a $5 million lotto ticket, of course you’d take it,” he said. Glaser had previously told the Herald the home, which is about 3 feet below sea level, had flood damage and standing water underneath it. “The house is a piece of crap,” he said at the time. “It’s a disgrace to Miami Beach.” The home is believed to be where Capone and his associates plotted the notorious St. Valentine’s Day massacre in which seven members of an opposing gang were gunned down in a Chicago parking garage in 1929.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State inspectors and an investigation found that a state agency unlawfully held onto millions of dollars in seized funds, spending money on Fitbits, exercise equipment and other items. A division of the Department of Revenue also spent funds on engraved firearms and stress balls shaped like beer mugs, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The report released last month by the Office of the Inspector General confirmed reporting last year by the newspaper and WSB-TV detailing how money seized in tax investigations was spent by the Department of Revenue’s Office of Special Investigations. Spending by that investigative division was “clearly wasteful” and “gave the appearance of extravagance,” the report found. The department has since changed its policies and returned money to the state treasury, where it should have gone in the first place, the newspaper reports. Revenue Commissioner Robyn Crittenden, who took over the department in July, vowed to make more reforms. “The department is actively moving forward to ensure the findings highlighted in this report are remedied,” she said. “We are committed to consistently doing the right thing and serving the taxpayers of Georgia with integrity and accountability.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Geological Survey officials have lowered the alert level for the Kilauea volcano, saying they expect its latest eruption to remain confined to the summit. The eruption began last week in the Halemaumau crater at the volcano’s summit on the Big Island. Officials with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory had raised Kilauea’s alert level to “warning” and its aviation code to red as they assessed the intensity of lava fountains covering the floor of the crater and billowing clouds of volcanic smoke. But over the past several days, a thick layer of molten lava has accumulated at the base of the crater, lessening fears it could spread. Observatory officials lowered the alert level to “watch” and the aviation code to orange Monday afternoon. The eruption remains confined to the crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It’s not in an area where there are any homes. Ron Hanatani, who has a pottery studio in Volcano Village near the park’s entrance, said residents and tourists have been flocking for a glimpse, though as a former geologist at the observatory, he has seen more spectacular eruptions. Village businesses are grateful for the attention during a normally slower time of year for tourists, said Ira Ono, owner of Volcano Garden Arts and Cafe Ono. Even though he has lived in the area for decades, he’s still mesmerized by Kilauea. “We see the glow at night,” he said. “It’s pretty dramatic and beautiful.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With Gov. Brad Little out of the state Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin issued an executive order involving COVID-19 vaccines. Oh no you don’t, said Little, who promised to rescind it in quick order and was expected to be back in the state Wednesday evening. The maneuvering of Idaho’s top leaders came while Little was in Texas meeting with nine other Republican governors about concerns with how President Joe Biden is handling border issues. McGeachin, a far-right Republican, is running for governor, and the governor and lieutenant governor don’t run on the same ticket in Idaho. Her executive order seeks, among other things, to prevent employers from requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. Most mainstream Republicans prefer to give private businesses latitude to make their own decisions. McGeachin was also rebuffed Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Michael J. Garshak in a query about activating Idaho National Guard troops and sending them to the U.S.-Mexico border. “I am unaware of any request for Idaho National Guard assistance under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) from Texas or Arizona,” Garshak wrote, in part, to McGeachin. “As you are aware, the Idaho National Guard is not a law enforcement agency.” It’s not the first time McGeachin has ruffled feathers in her capacity as acting governor with Little out of state. In May, she issued an order banning mask mandates that Little eliminated on his return, saying such decisions were best left to local officials.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State and federal officials on Monday unveiled a mobile unit that they say will add speed and efficiency to digital investigations of child pornography and exploitation at a time when young people are using the internet more than ever before. The gray van is assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children task force, said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, whose office oversees the group and its increasing caseload. Tips about alleged exploitation received by the task force increased by 118% from 2017 to 2020 and are on pace to jump another 23% this year. “Child predators are actively trolling the internet, trading, selling and collecting images of the most vile sexual acts involving children,” Raoul said. Other predators log on to appear to innocently befriend young people, he said, then lure them to meet-ups for sex. The mobile unit is funded by a $174,000 federal grant and outfitted with advanced technology. When authorities target a suspect, the unit will be key in an environment where timing is critical, and evidence integrity can make or break a case, said Zeus Flores, a digital forensic examiner for the task force. Instead of having to work in what could be squalid conditions – “some of the homes we’re going into are frankly biohazards,” Flores said – the mobile unit will offer privacy and safety.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mourners gathered at a small chapel Tuesday evening to remember the dozens of Hoosiers lost last year to domestic violence. The Indianapolis-based Domestic Violence Network, which seeks to raise awareness of and end domestic violence across the state, hosts the annual memorial. The number of people honored Tuesday was the highest in recent memory, advocates said. Among the 74 Hoosiers known to have been killed in domestic violence incidents between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, 34 were from Marion County, with the oldest 77 and the youngest just 7. The names of those 34 from the capital area were read aloud at Tuesday’s service. Domestic Violence Network Executive Director Kelly McBride said the increase in deaths was “staggering.” Eleven people were honored at 2020’s service and 16 in 2019. Ash Rathwell, training services manager for the network, said local service providers have seen a sharp increase in calls for help regarding domestic violence since the pandemic began. But a report released by the group this year examined the overwhelming need domestic violence service providers experienced long before COVID-19. On any given day, there were more than 1,800 victims and survivors served by direct service providers, but at least 182 requests for services go unmet, it found.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Legislature on Tuesday rejected the first set of redistricting maps drawn by a state agency, raising concerns that majority Republicans may opt to insert politics into the state’s nonpartisan process. The Legislative Services Agency drew the maps, which proposed revising Iowa’s four congressional districts to include two that lean heavily toward Republicans, one that favors Democrats and one that both parties would have a chance at winning. After a committee moved the first set of maps to the Senate floor without debate, the full Senate rejected the first plan on a party-line vote, with all 32 Republicans voting “no” and the 18 Democrats voting “yes.” By state law, the LSA is responsible for following detailed guidelines to ensure population balance among Iowa’s congressional districts and to prevent political influence in the initial drafting of changes. By law, the Legislature can only accept or reject the maps without amendment. The LSA now has 35 days to draw a second set of maps, which again must be voted up or down by lawmakers with no amendments. If that is rejected, the LSA would have another 35 days to draw a third set, which could be amended with majority Republicans leading that process – something that hasn’t happened in 40 years, since the first time the state’s current redistricting procedure was in place.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are setting up a new anti-mandate committee targeting COVID-19 vaccines and masking in schools. “I’m absolutely not sure it’s safe,” Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said of the vaccines. Thompson is one of 11 legislators on the Special Joint Committee on Government Overreach and the Impact of COVID-19 Mandates. Republican leadership announced their eight appointees Monday. Democrats haven’t appointed their three allotted members. “It would be one thing if we knew this thing absolutely worked, and there was no adverse reaction,” Thompson told reporters Tuesday. “But that’s not the case right now.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. But Thompson said that “this is not a true vaccine ... an attenuated or weakened version of the virus itself. This is a a genetically engineered vaccine that some doctors I’ve talked to have told me that this is introducing basically an autoimmune disease into your body.” Republicans have balked at President Joe Biden’s proposed vaccine-or-testing mandates. Brushing aside concerns about immunocompromised people and children who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination, Thompson asked why Biden and others who’ve been inoculated would care whether others have gotten their shots.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bourbon industry is signaling it’s increasingly bullish on its future after reaching new production heights despite the COVID-19 pandemic and trade disputes in key overseas markets. Bluegrass State bourbon producers filled nearly 2.5 million barrels in 2020, setting a new production record, the Kentucky Distillers’ Association said Monday. It marked the third straight year Kentucky distilleries filled more than 2 million barrels of bourbon. And for the first time in the modern era of American whiskey, Kentucky has 10 million barrels of bourbon aging in distillery warehouses, it said. The state of 4.5 million people has more than 10.3 million barrels of maturing bourbon, according to the latest figures. “Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry continues to invest in our commonwealth at unprecedented levels, despite global pandemic disruptions, exorbitant taxes and ongoing trade wars,” said Eric Gregory, president of the distillers’ group. “This is truly a historic and landmark record.” Massive inventories are a bet on the future because most bourbons typically age four to eight years before reaching their market. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A 2017 lawsuit challenging former prosecutors for hardball tactics, including the issuance of fake subpoenas and the jailing of crime victims who wouldn’t cooperate with investigators, was settled Tuesday in federal court. The suit centered on the practices of staff under former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, who did not seek reelection last year after two six-year terms. Cannizzaro’s successor, Jason Williams, agreed to the appointment of a special monitor to ensure his office complies with terms of the settlement, including detailed policies written to ensure prosecutors don’t use “coercive or unlawful means to secure cooperation from crime victims or witnesses.” Cannizzaro ended his staff’s use of phony subpoenas soon after the practice was exposed by an online news outlet, The Lens. He defended the jailing of witnesses, including victims, as a rarely used but sometimes necessary practice. Civil rights and criminal justice advocates were harshly critical of the practices. Among the harshest critics was Williams, a defense attorney and City Council member. He won election to succeed Cannizzarro late last year while running as a reformer who vowed to end what he called a “win at all cost” mentality in the district attorney’s office. The settlement calls for a $120,000 payout to three remaining plaintiffs.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: A high school student staged a schoolwide walkout after her anti-racism art display sparked complaints, forcing school officials to remove it. York High School senior Claudia Corcoran’s display was part of a school project that tasked students with creating a topic inspired by a book, Principal Karl Francis said. Corcoran’s project included a two-panel painting that describes racism as an issue that continues to plague American society. She donated the piece to the school’s librarian, who displayed it in the library. The York School Department administration ordered that the school should remove the display after complaints from parents, students and faculty. But more complaints on social media followed after its removal. The administration said the artwork was removed because the librarian did not get approval to display it. But in the past, librarians have been allowed to hang student art without permission from school officials. In a statement, YSD Superintendent Lou Goscinski said the student’s art isn’t an issue, “but once we display it, it becomes the speech of the school.” Following that statement, Corcoran staged a walkout Sept. 29, demanding that the school return her artwork to the library. Two days later, Francis announced the art would be put back on display.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff has been indicted on charges that he defrauded a state agency he led by inducing it to pay him nearly $280,000 in mostly severance pay before he moved to his post in the governor’s office, the Maryland U.S. attorney announced Tuesday. Roy McGrath also used funds from the Maryland Environmental Service to pay a personal pledge to a museum and got the agency to pay tuition expenses for a class after he left his job as executive director, according to the indictment. He also recorded conversations with senior state officials without their consent and faces state charges, it said. McGrath, of Naples, Florida, fraudulently obtained $276,731 from the environmental service, according to the indictment. The Baltimore Sun, which first reported the story, said McGrath characterized the case as “political persecution.” His attorney, Bruce Marcus, wrote in an email to the Associated Press that his client “vigorously and categorically denies the allegations.” McGrath resigned in August 2020 when he was just 11 weeks into the job as Hogan’s top aide, after the payments became public. Michael Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, described the charges Tuesday as “very serious and deeply troubling.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Acting Mayor Kim Janey on Tuesday signed an ordinance intended to address climate change by requiring large buildings in the city to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The measure “is a monumental achievement that will have positive impacts on our residents for generations to come,” Janey said in a statement. “We know that the negative effects of climate change bear a disproportionate burden on our most socially vulnerable communities.” Last month the City Council unanimously approved the ordinance, which applies to about 3,500 commercial and residential buildings of 20,000 square feet or more, or about 4% of structures in Boston, according to city officials. They account for 60% of Boston’s building emissions. To reach the goals, building owners can perform energy efficiency improvements; switch to clean, efficient and electric heating systems or fossil fuel-free systems; and purchase clean energy. The measure is an amendment to a 2013 ordinance that required all commercial and residential buildings of at least 35,000 square feet or with at least 35 units to report their energy and water use to the city every year. Buildings covered were also required to show concerted efforts to reduce their energy use or emissions every five years through energy actions or audits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Canada invoked a treaty with the United States and asked a judge Monday to suspend litigation over Michigan’s effort to shut down a Great Lakes oil pipeline. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau made clear that his government is backing Enbridge, the Calgary-based company that operates Line 5. Canada said it requested negotiations with the U.S. about the pipeline. It cited a provision in a 1977 treaty that says no public authority in either country can take steps to interfere with the flow of hydrocarbons. Line 5 moves about 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily between Wisconsin and Ontario, traversing parts of northern Michigan. A section of the pipeline runs on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which connects lakes Huron and Michigan at the top of the Lower Peninsula. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, have said Line 5 is a grave threat to the Great Lakes and should be closed to prevent spills. Whitmer said she was disappointed by Canada invoking the treaty. “Rather than taking steps to diversify energy supply and ensure resilience, Canada has channeled its efforts into defending an oil company with an abysmal environmental track record,” she said, noting an Enbridge pipeline rupture into a southwestern Michigan river in 2010.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz called on lawmakers Tuesday to approve a series of new moves to respond to the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccine and testing requirements for teachers, school staff and long-term care workers, plus measures to relieve strained hospital capacity. The Democratic governor detailed his proposal in a letter to lawmakers after meeting privately with legislative leaders. He urged lawmakers to approve the measures in a special session that was originally envisioned for last month to approve a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers who have risked their lives during the pandemic. Negotiations on that plan have yet to produce an agreement and missed a Labor Day target for completion. Since then, Walz has proposed that the session also include drought relief for farmers. But he has also insisted that Senate Republicans agree not to use the special session to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, as some have threatened. Walz urged lawmakers to approve a series of waivers and enact other relief to allow hospitals, nursing homes and child care centers to respond more effectively to the surge. He noted that more Minnesotans are hospitalized for COVID-19 than last spring and that at the end of last week only two pediatric intensive care beds were available in the entire state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state on Wednesday followed through on its promise to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that it come up with a plan to prevent unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental illness. Lawyers for the state filed a notice of appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On Sept. 7, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ordered that the state’s initial plan be submitted to the U.S. Justice Department and a mental health expert for feedback within 120 days. The judge said then that the final plan must be completed in 180 days. State lawyers asked last week that the deadline be postponed because Mississippi intended to appeal Reeves’ ruling. James Shelson, the state’s lawyer, wrote Sept. 27 that if the Department of Mental Health were required to complete its plan and other requirements of Reeves’ order in the allocated time frame, “Mississippi will suffer irreparable injuries from undue interference with its mental health system and a fundamental alteration of that system both in costs and structure.” Under Reeves’ order, the state is responsible for tracking a wide array of data, fund new vouchers to help people with mental illness pay rent and utilities, and start a clinical review process sampling 100 to 200 patients a year “to assure that services are working as intended to address the needs of people with serious mental illness.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBonne Terre: A man was put to death Tuesday for killing three workers while robbing a convenience store nearly three decades ago – an execution performed over objections from racial justice activists, lawmakers and even the pope. Ernest Johnson died from an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre. He silently mouthed words to relatives as the process began. His breathing became labored, and he puffed out his cheeks, then swallowed hard. Within seconds, all movement stopped. In his written last statement, Johnson said he was sorry “and have remorse for what I do.” He said he loved his family and friends and thanked those who prayed for him. Johnson was pronounced dead at 6:11 p.m., nine minutes after the dose was administered. A corrections department spokeswoman said four relatives representing all three victims were present. Johnson’s witnesses included relatives and his lawyer. No relatives spoke after the execution. Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said 59 demonstrators gathered on the edge of the prison grounds. Johnson had a history of scoring extremely low on IQ tests, dating back to childhood. His attorney, Jeremy Weis, said Johnson also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and lost about one-fifth of his brain tissue when a benign tumor was removed in 2008.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana law school is launching an independent review following a walkout and rally over alleged mistreatment of sexual harassment and assault victims. About 100 university students and community members gathered Tuesday morning to demand change and accountability in the Alexander Blewett III School of Law, the Missoulian reports. Speakers and students called on law school Dean Paul Kirgis and Associate Dean Sally Weaver to resign, saying they had failed students and created a toxic environment. As first reported by the Daily Montanan, women from the law school say the two administrators discouraged them from reporting allegations of sexual harassment and assault to the university’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. Following students’ demands, university officials are launching an “independent, outside review to assess the learning and working environment in the Law School and the mechanisms in place to best support students,” according to a statement to the Missoulian on Tuesday from university spokesman Dave Kuntz. The institution has invested significant resources into investigating the allegations against the law school, Kuntz said in the statement. Those initial investigations found law school leaders did not violate university policy.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A man who fled to Nicaragua after being charged with dozens of felony counts of child pornography and enticement has pleaded no contest to seven of the counts. Adam Hawhee, 29, faces up to 88 years in prison when he’s sentenced in December, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Hawhee was originally charged last year with two counts of child enticement and 26 counts of child pornography possession. He was accused of trying to entice two 7-year-old girls at an Omaha park in March 2020, leading police to search his home, where they reported finding more than 100 child pornography images – some involving toddlers. Hawhee was freed after posting bond. He was jailed again four months later after allegedly exposing himself to a young boy and trying to coax the boy into his vehicle. Hawhee was freed again after posting bond and fled to Nicaragua, missing a December court appearance. When Omaha police found him and had him returned to Nebraska, a judge set his bond at a whopping $50 million – believed to the highest in Douglas County history.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Tribal lawyers are asking a U.S. judge to reconsider her earlier refusal to block digging at a proposed lithium mine where they say newly uncovered evidence proves it was the sacred site of a massacre of dozens of Native Americans in 1865. The new motion filed in federal court in Reno includes an 1865 newspaper report and two eyewitness accounts of how at least 31 Paiute men, women and children were “murdered by federal soldiers” at Thacker Pass. The accounts were in an autobiography published in 1929 by well-known American labor organizer Bill Haywood. One was from a cavalry volunteer who participated in the slaughter and the other a tribal member who survived it. Nevada Lithium Corp.’s construction is slated to begin next year at what would be the largest lithium mine in the nation and biggest open-pit lithium mine in the world. Demand for the mineral, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is expected to triple in the next five years. The only significant lithium mine now operating in the U.S. is in Nevada. Another planned halfway between Reno and Las Vegas by Ioneer Ltd. also faces legal challenges from environmentalists fighting to protect Tiehm’s buckwheat, a rare desert wildflower that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formally proposed last week to be listed as an endangered species.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As a drug recovery program comes to an end at fire stations in the city, a local center that’s part of a state-founded network can offer immediate screening and other services, Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday. The Doorway of Greater Manchester is now available 24 hours a day by calling 2-1-1 and is offering recovery services to coincide with the closing of the Manchester Safe Station program. “I would like to thank the Manchester Fire Department for their tireless service these last few years,” Sununu said in a statement. “Our Doorways have served a tremendous purpose and have provided an excellent service, and we are building out a system that goes beyond the scope of Safe Station.” Safe Station was founded by Manchester firefighters in 2016 in response to the community’s opioid epidemic. People could go to any Manchester fire station for screening and handoff to services. The department will continue to provide mobile, field-based substance use disorder outreach services. The Doorway program is a network of nine locations across the state that provide one-stop access to substance use services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A man who used dating apps to lure and kill three women five years ago was sentenced Wednesday to 160 years in prison after a trial in which it was revealed that friends of one victim did their own detective work on social media to ferret out the suspect. Khalil Wheeler-Weaver, 25, sat motionless as the judge gave the sentence in state court in Newark. The sentencing was preceded by emotional statements by family members of victims Robin West and Sarah Butler. In a brief statement before they spoke, Wheeler-Weaver denied responsibility, telling Superior Court Judge Mark S. Ali that he was framed. Wheeler-Weaver’s mother, aunt and brother sat in the gallery but didn’t address the court. The sentences covered three murders, one attempted murder, and other counts including kidnapping, aggravated arson and desecration of human remains. The Essex County prosecutor’s office had credited friends of Butler, a college student from Montclair, with using social media to help police find Wheeler-Weaver. They gained access to her social media accounts, set up a fake account, lured Wheeler-Weaver to a meeting in Montclair and notified police, according to prosecutors. A fourth woman who survived an attack and testified at Wheeler-Weaver’s trial also provided crucial information that helped investigators.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The City Council has adopted a resolution that acknowledges ongoing generational trauma caused by U.S. Indigenous boarding school policies and formalizes a commitment to work with Indigenous communities toward reconciliation and healing. Councilors voted in favor of the measure during a meeting Monday. Mayor Tim Keller is expected to sign the resolution next week on Indigenous Peoples Day. The city has been researching the history of a public park where students of the former Albuquerque Indian School were believed to have been buried more than a century ago. Ground-penetrating radar will be used to study the site, and another meeting was planned later this week to talk about how to keep moving forward. “It really is kind of a first step for us as a city to move forward toward healing and also to be inclusive of all of our communities in Albuquerque and to understand some of the pain that people have lived with over the years of not knowing,” Council President Cynthia Borrego said during the virtual meeting. Indigenous activists became concerned earlier this year when a plaque memorializing the students from the former school vanished. They established a makeshift memorial of flowers and other offerings and demanded an investigation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal agents raided the offices Tuesday of a New York City police union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, and the Long Island home of its bombastic leader, who has clashed with city officials over his incendiary tweets and hard-line tactics. FBI spokesperson Martin Feely said agents were “carrying out a law enforcement action in connection with an ongoing investigation.” Agents were seen carrying boxes out of the union’s Manhattan headquarters and loading them into a van. The FBI also searched union President Ed Mullins’ home in Port Washington, Feely said. Mullins resigned as the union’s president Tuesday night, according to a message the union’s board sent to members, saying he did so at the board’s urging. The union represents about 13,000 active and retired NYPD sergeants and controls a $264 million retirement fund. “The nature and scope of this criminal investigation has yet to be determined. However, it is clear that President Mullins is apparently the target of the federal investigation,” the board’s message said. “We have no reason to believe that any other member of the SBA is involved or targeted in this matter.” The union’s board said that while Mullins is presumed innocent, it asked him to step aside to ensure the union’s day-to-day operations continue unimpeded.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some supporters of Republican former Gov. Pat McCrory’s efforts to contest the 2016 gubernatorial election results can be sued for allegedly defaming four residents who were falsely accused of voting twice, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. The complaint the Southern Coalition for Social Justice brought forward in 2017 could pave the way for lawmakers and their supporters to be penalized for making inaccurate voter fraud claims in future elections. The unanimous ruling from the three appeals court judges allows a trial court to hear the case against the Pat McCrory Committee Legal Defense Fund and the Virginia-based Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky law firm named in the complaint. The judges also decided that William Clark Porter, a GOP official in Greensboro whose signature was on one of the election protests that was filed, is entitled to a legal defense that would likely clear him of defamation claims because he participated in a “quasi-judicial election protest proceeding.” “Mr. Porter was not the puppet master. He was the puppet, and obviously, he did make serious allegations against our clients, but this is a good ruling for us,” said Allison Riggs, who leads the voting rights program at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “We believe that we now can proceed against the masterminds of this concerted effort to defame North Carolina voters.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has elected a woman to be its next leader, according to results released Tuesday. Janet Alkire would be the first woman to head the tribal council in more than half a century. Gates Kelley was elected Standing Rock chairwoman in 1946 and was the first woman to preside over a tribe in the United States, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Alkire received 829 votes to defeat current tribal Vice Chairman Ira Taken Alive, who came in with 762 votes. Taken Alive, who said he is contesting the results, edged Alkire in the July primary that advanced the top two vote-getters. A 15-year Air Force veteran, Alkire has served as Standing Rock’s executive director twice. Her platform included prioritizing youth and elderly wellness initiatives, homelessness, economic development and government transparency. She favors mental health, addiction treatment and rehabilitation for all members and is an advocate for child welfare. The Standing Rock Reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has lost its most important accreditation, a major blow to an institution once widely admired in its industry and by the general public. The zoo said it plans to appeal the decision announced Wednesday by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, considered the nation’s top zoo-accrediting body, one day after the institution announced its new leader. The accrediting group cited concerns about the zoo’s animal programs department and inappropriate businesses practices by its former leaders. Tom Stalf, the zoo’s former president and chief executive, and Greg Bells, its former chief financial officer, resigned in March after an investigation by the Columbus Dispatch found they allowed relatives to live in houses owned or controlled by the zoo and sought tickets for family members to zoo entertainment events. Subsequent audits initiated by the zoo’s board found that improper spending and questionable business practices by the pair resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in zoo losses. Investigations and reviews by the Ohio attorney general’s office and the state auditor are pending. Besides the financial issues, the accrediting group voiced concerns about the zoo’s acquisition of ambassador animals in its animal programs department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor is again asking the state Supreme Court to remove two members of the Pardon and Parole Board from the case of a high-profile death row inmate. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater filed the motion Monday to remove Kelly Doyle and Andrew Luck from the clemency hearing for Julius Jones. Prater alleges the two are biased because of their work with inmates on criminal justice reform. “Both Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle engage in political activities that work to release inmates from prison, all of which makes their Board decisions, at the very least, have an appearance of impropriety,” Prater wrote. The court previously rejected Prater’s request to remove the two from Jones’ commutation hearing on the same grounds. The same five-member board narrowly rejected clemency Tuesday for another death row inmate convicted of killing a prison cafeteria worker in 1998, paving the way for the state’s first execution in more than six years. John Marion Grant, 60, is scheduled for lethal injection Oct. 28. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for killing 58-year-old Gay Carter at the Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy. Grant’s attorneys said he received ineffective trial counsel because his lawyers never properly presented mitigating evidence, such as his difficult childhood.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: After receiving positive reviews, experts say a nonpolice first-response unit has the potential to be a “citywide solution” for an alternative to nonemergency calls regarding people experiencing a mental health crisis or homelessness. During a City Council work session Tuesday, researchers suggested the Portland Street Response team pilot program should be expanded, following a Portland State University study that evaluated the program’s first six months. “Our first recommendation is to commit the necessary resources toward the expansion of Portland Street Response to eventually make its services available throughout the city and during all hours of the day,” researchers wrote in the report. The unarmed Portland Street Response team is composed of a mental health crisis therapist, a firefighter paramedic and two community health workers who are dispatched to 911 calls related to mental health crises or the homeless population. The team currently works Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. From February to mid-August, the team responded to 383 incidents, with two-thirds involving people experiencing homelessness and roughly half involving someone who needed mental health care. Less than 4% resulted in a trip to the hospital, and none led to arrests, the report found.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSomerset: Officials in a rural western Pennsylvania county say the elected prosecutor’s access to his office and the courthouse has been restricted after he was charged last month with violently raping a woman he knew through work. Somerset County District Attorney Jeffrey Lynn Thomas, 36, was accused last month of having attacked the woman in her Windber home. He was charged with rape, indecent and simple assault, strangulation and criminal trespassing. County Solicitor Michael Barbera told The (Johnstown) Tribune Democrat that Thomas can no longer use a remote “key fob” to enter the building through side doors or after hours. Instead, he must use the main public entrance with metal detectors and scanners and staffed by sheriff’s deputies, he said. Barbera said that because Thomas is charged with felonies, he no longer has access to a law enforcement database. The Republican said he is planning to plead not guilty and fight the charges in court. He told reporters Friday through his attorney that he’s taking a leave of absence to focus on his case. His lawyer also told reporters Friday that “there’s much more to this story than meets the eye.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSmithfield: Veterinarians are trying to save a bald eagle that was found injured, with infected eyes and elevated lead levels. An environmental police officer and wildlife control specialist from the state Department of Environmental Management rescued the young bird from the shore of Stump Pond on Saturday and brought it to the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island in Saunderstown, where it’s being treated. The national bird since 1782, bald eagles were once an endangered species, and their recovery is considered “a spectacular conservation success” story, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Still, there are only “a small handful of bald eagle pairs breeding in Rhode Island,” said John Herbert, a biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. Veterinarians believe the bird rescued Saturday is a young adult, and he’s almost totally blind, said Kristin Fletcher, executive director of the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island. It has a lesion on one eye and an apparent problem in the other eye and is being treated with eye drops. Fletcher said the bird might have neurological damage and is being tube-fed. A low level of lead was also detected in the bird, she said. The clinic has treated about a half-dozen bald eagles through the years, and “pretty much every eagle we’ve had has lead issues,” she noted, saying the metal likely gets into the birds through shotgun pellets and sinkers used in fishing.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The executive director of the South Carolina Election Commission has left her position several months earlier than planned, with the agency saying she’s taking a new job at a nonprofit that provides cybersecurity resources to election-related entities. Marci Andino had planned to step away from her role Dec. 31 but left office Friday to take over as director of the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, part of the nonprofit Center for Internet Security, commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told The State newspaper. Until a permanent replacement is found, Voter Services Director Howard Knabb is taking the helm in an interim role, Whitmire said. Leading the agency since 2003, Andino implemented a new statewide voter registration system, voter ID law and candidate filing process. Her departure follows tension with state Republican leaders in the run-up to the 2020 election. She recommended stricter safety measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including expanding absentee voting. One of Andino’s suggestions was challenged in court and made it all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court: the removal of a witness signature requirement for absentee ballots. But the court ruled unanimously that the rule should stay.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A panel of judges will review allegations that Gov. Kristi Noem abused her office to help a family member obtain a state appraiser license. The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday announced it was referring the complaint to the South Dakota Government Accountability, which will investigate the matter and determine if any misconduct occurred. The allegations center on a meeting Noem had with officials with the Department of Labor and Regulation after the agency had recommended denying Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license. Peters ultimately was granted the license in late 2020, four months after the meeting, and shortly after, the state employee who’d recommended denial was no longer employed in the labor office. The Associated Press reported Peters began working as a state-registered appraiser – an entry-level job – in 2016. And in September 2019, Peters applied to become a certified residential appraiser. The appraiser certification program moved to deny the license in summer 2020. Noem initially refused comment on the story but used social media last week to deny any wrongdoing. “I never once asked for special treatment for Kassidy,” the Republican governor wrote. “She is my daughter and I’m proud of her. I raised her to accomplish things on her own.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center has landed $3.2 million in federal money to upgrade a laboratory used for research on infectious diseases. In a news release, the Memphis campus said the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded the money for equipment and infrastructure improvements at the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory. The school said the lab is one of about a dozen nationwide commissioned by the institute after the 9/11 attacks to study very contagious pathogens as a safeguard against bioterrorism. The laboratory opened in 2009. It has played a role in research related to COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Opponents of a new state ban on most abortions filed a lawsuit in Illinois on Tuesday after weeks of being thwarted by courts elsewhere in their efforts to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law. The latest legal challenge came as the Biden administration waited for a federal judge in Austin to rule on a request to halt the law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions in Texas once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks after conception. A hearing was held Friday, but there was no timetable on a decision. Although courts have blocked similar measures elsewhere in U.S., the Texas law has remained in place since early September because it uniquely leaves enforcement solely up to private citizens, who are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages if they prevail in a lawsuit against abortion providers. A San Antonio doctor who admitted defying the law last month was quickly sued – not by anti-abortion advocates but by former attorneys in Illinois and Arkansas who oppose the law and are trying to force a court to weigh in. The Center for Reproductive Rights is now asking a federal court in Chicago to consolidate the lawsuits against Dr. Alan Braid and declare the law unconstitutional. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to remain in place through inaction.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program Clinic from the St. George Regional Hospital is offering five informational meetings this month for those affected by radiation from nuclear testing in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. The clinic is focusing on more than 60,000 people, known as Downwinders, who were exposed to radiation at testing sites during the 1950s and ’60s. A law known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act will expire in July 2022, according to a press release from Intermountain Healthcare. Those who qualify for RECA will be able to learn more about the compensation for which they can qualify and about starting the process through these public meetings. Qualifying cancers are leukemia; multiple myeloma; non-Hodgkin lymphomas; and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gallbladder, lung and ovary.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state plans to halt legislation that would change the way its criminal justice system handles 18- and 19-year-old criminal offenders because officials said some young offenders are too dangerous to be treated as juveniles. The state became the first in the U.S. last year when it passed the law known as Raise the Age, which treats 18-year-olds as juvenile offenders instead of adults. The reform would also include 19-year-old offenders, Vermont Public Radio reports. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration said it has concerns with the law including 19-year-olds. “There was a level of dangerousness there that we do not have the expertise to manage as a juvenile system,” said Sean Brown, commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The administration also said it wants to reform the youth offender program, which allows for people as old as 22 to go through confidential proceedings in family court, instead of the adult court system. Brown said the reform would allow an assessment to decide who is eligible for youth offender status, instead of prosecutors and judges. Washington County State’s Attorney Rory Thibault said a potential new path through the criminal justice system would allow those ages 19 to 25 to process as adults but give them the same confidentiality as in the juvenile system.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: City leaders want Pharrell Williams to bring his popular Something in the Water festival back next year, but the musician is reluctant, saying a “toxic energy” has run the city for too long, and he wishes Virginia Beach had taken a more proactive stance after a police officer fatally shot his cousin. City leaders appealed to the Grammy-winning producer to restore the festival in 2022. In 2019, the event brought $24 million to the local Hampton Roads economy. But Williams, who lived there as a child, wrote that he held the festival to ease racial tension, and he feels the city isn’t valuing his ideas for promoting “human rights for all.” “I wish the same energy I’ve felt from Virginia Beach leadership upon losing the festival would have been similarly channeled following the loss of my relative’s life,” Williams wrote in response. “I love my city, but for far too long it has been run by and with toxic energy.” Williams’ 25-year-old cousin, Donovon Lynch, was killed in March on a chaotic night during which 10 people were shot in separate incidents. Lynch’s father filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit in June. In its response, the city said Lynch, who was Black, pointed a gun at the officer who shot him. The officer, who also is Black, “feared for his life and the lives of other officers and citizens in the vicinity,” the city said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Northwest Carpenters Union said it reached a new contract agreement with the Associated General Contractors that would put several thousand striking carpenters in the Seattle area back on the job Wednesday pending a vote on the deal. Union members have been on strike since Sept. 16, with rotating pickets at some major projects. Leading up to the strike, union members rejected four previous contract proposals put forward by union leadership, the Seattle Times reports. Carpenters who voted “no” on previous deals said the agreements did not do enough to boost pay and benefits as the cost of living in the Seattle area skyrockets. Current carpenter wages range from $46.92 to $48.42 an hour. The last rejected offer would have increased pay by about $9.40 per hour over the course of four years, along with increases in benefits. In a statement on its website Tuesday, the union said the new deal includes a $10.02 “total package” increase over three years, retroactive pay dating back to June 1, and a 50-cent increase in the parking reimbursement in some areas of Seattle. Although a majority of union members voted to authorize the strike last month, many of 12,000 members have not walked off the job because they work at high-profile job sites governed by no-strike agreements.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPrinceton: A southern West Virginia health department stopped its needle exchange program due to strict requirements under a new state law, officials said. The Mercer County Health Department voted last month to discontinue its program, saying the new regulations are so strict that compliance is not possible, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. “Under the new law, we can’t comply,” Health Department Administrator Roger Topping told board members. He noted almost 50 requirements that had to be approved for a license to offer a harm-reduction program that includes a needle exchange. Local health officials had begun the needle exchange in 2019 in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV, as outbreaks have exploded in West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative legal group has threatened legal action against the University of Wisconsin-Madison, claiming it hired three mental health providers to serve only students of color. UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone said Wednesday that the original announcement of the hires cited in the complaint – which said the new hires would “exclusively serve students of color” – was inaccurate and had been updated. “Mental health providers at University Health Services are not assigned based on a student’s race nor are they limited in which students they serve based on race,” she said. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty raised the issue in a Wednesday letter sent to leaders at both UW-Madison and UW System, saying the jobs as originally described violate state and federal laws against racial discrimination. WILL attorney Dan Lennington cited a Sept. 9 announcement that said University Health Services had hired nine new mental health providers, three of whom “will exclusively serve students of color, joining eight providers already in this role.” The school said the new providers would bring cultural awareness to help support students of color. McGlone said students have the option to choose one of the providers with expertise in serving students of color if they wish.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 1,000 with the addition of 45 deaths to the official tally Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Most of the newly reported deaths occurred last month, according to the paper, which noted that the death count now exceeds the number of residents in almost half of incorporated communities across the sparsely populated state.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/21/mow-may-haunted-house-shooting-monk-seal-birth-news-around-states/50119967/", "title": "No Mow May, haunted house shooting: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Civil rights pioneer Jo Ann Robinson, who played an instrumental role in the historic 13-month Montgomery Bus Boycott in the mid-1950s, had a residence hall named after her on Alabama State University’s campus Tuesday. The hall was previously named for Bibb Graves, former Alabama governor and member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Board of Trustees voted to change the name in September. Dr. Sheree Finley, a relative of Robinson, called the renaming exciting. “She’s finally being brought to the forefront,” Finley said. Local artist Kevin King painted a portrait of Robinson during the event. The featured speaker of the event was Fred Gray, famed civil rights attorney, who recalled planning the bus boycott in Robinson’s living room. “Little did many know that (many of the) activities that (had an) impact on the civil rights movement in Alabama occurred at Jo Ann Robinson’s house,” Gray said. “She was the person who was interested in having mass participation. We could have desegregated the buses without a protest, but she was interested in getting something done with the community.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A legal challenge has been filed claiming proposed state Senate districts for the capital city area unconstitutionally favor the Eagle River suburb. The motion to reject the amended redistricting plan and to modify it was filed Monday as Anchorage Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews considers the legality of the map approved last week by the state’s redistricting board, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The new map was drawn after portions of the board’s first proposal were ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. Each state Senate district is composed of two House districts. The board’s first proposal sought to link Eagle River to the south Muldoon area of Anchorage, which the Alaska Supreme Court called an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The court ruled in a lawsuit brought by east Anchorage residents Felisa Wilson, George Martinez and Yarrow Silvers, who also filed Monday’s challenge. The new proposal seeks to link south Eagle River to south Anchorage and north Eagle River to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The new challenge claims the redistricting board incorrectly interpreted the court’s instructions by keeping Muldoon districts together but again splitting the Eagle River districts. The filing seeks an order requiring the board to keep both House districts in Eagle River together.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A wildfire nearly tripled in size as relentless winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods on the outskirts of a college and tourist town, keeping hundreds of residents away from their homes and destroying more than two dozen structures. The blaze continued its run Wednesday through dry grass and scattered Ponderosa pines around homes into volcanic cinder fields, where roots underground can combust and send small rocks flying into the air, fire officials said. Persistent spring winds and 50 mph gusts hindered firefighters. “This is a heads-up for everywhere else in the state,” said fire information officer Dick Fleishman. “If you have dry grass up next to your house, it’s time to get that cleaned up.” Fire managers are contending with tight resources as wildfires burn around the Southwest. The U.S. has 16 top-level national fire management teams, and four of those are dedicated to blazes in Arizona and New Mexico – something Fleishman said is rare this early in the wildfire season. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of the wildfires north of Flagstaff and south of Prescott in Arizona. On the outskirts of Flagstaff – where tourists and locals revel in hiking and horseback riding trails, camping spots, and the vast expanse of cinder fields for off-road vehicle use – flames soared as high as 100 feet. Popular national monuments including Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki were closed because of the wildfire.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the National Park Service to allow citizens to gather plants within the Buffalo National River to use for purposes including food, crafts and medicine. The river, located in the Ozark Mountains, was established as the country’s first national river in 1972. “This area has a vibrant history of helping sustain our Cherokee people with food, the cane and bushes for our Cherokee crafts, and leaves and roots for traditional medicine,” Deputy Chief Bryan Warner said. The agreement, announced Wednesday, will establish a process for Cherokee citizens to gather plants in parts of the national park including the Lost Valley, Tyler Bend, Buffalo Point and Rush areas. “This i7/ 8 s an important step in the continuing efforts to embrace our tribal partners in the management of public lands at Buffalo National River,” said Mark Foust, National Park Service superintendent at Buffalo National River. “The Cherokee Nation offers invaluable information, ecological knowledge, and a unique perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the benefits of public land.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: City supervisors have approved legislation prohibiting police from storing DNA obtained from rape kits and other crime scene evidence in city-run databases for more than 60 days. Tuesday’s unanimous vote came two months after San Francisco’s district attorney disclosed that police used a sexual assault victim’s DNA against her in 2016 in an unrelated 2021 property crime case. The revelation by DA Chesa Boudin prompted a national outcry among law enforcement, legal experts, lawmakers and advocates of sexual assault victims. Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who introduced the legislation, said there were no local laws regulating the storage or use of DNA profiles in local police databases, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Victim samples cannot be uploaded to state and federal DNA databases, which are more tightly regulated, and the legislation does not apply to those databases. “The fact that the police department’s crime lab has been storing and using victims’ physical evidence against victims came as a shock to most of us in the city,” Ronen said. The department stores DNA information in what it calls a quality control database in order to ensure samples are not contaminated. The department has said it stopped the practice. Police chief Bill Scott told police commissioners in March that he’d discovered 17 crime victim profiles, 11 of them from rape kits, that were matched using a crime victims database during unrelated investigations.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A “game changing” app will soon be in the hands of local first responders, and officials say it will improve their interactions with those in the community who have mental health issues or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Fort Collins Police Services announced Thursday that its officers will begin using the Vitals app in a first-of-its-kind partnership with UCHealth through the co-responder program and Mental Health Response Team. People and caregivers can download the Vitals app and create a profile that includes an individual’s name, photo, other identifying information and medical information along with their behavioral triggers and de-escalation techniques, which can help officers respond better in a crisis situation, UCHealth Co-Responder Supervisor Stephanie Booco said during a news conference. Fort Collins police officers and UCHealth co-responders who have the app will receive notifications when they are near someone with a profile and can use the information in the profile to better assist or resolve a situation. The technology is a “game changer” for the community, Fort Collins Police Services Chief Jeff Swoboda said. Fort Collins is the first community in Colorado to start using the Vitals app and the first community in the country to use it with a co-responder program, Booco said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers advanced legislation Tuesday evening that abortion rights advocates say is needed to protect in-state medical providers from legal action, as well as patients who travel to Connecticut to terminate a pregnancy and those who help them. It comes amid new abortion restrictions being enacted in a growing number of conservative states. The bill cleared the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 87-60. It now awaits action in the Senate. Although Connecticut codified the right to abortion in 1990, proponents said steps need to be taken now to prepare for the U.S. Supreme Court possibly overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. However, the socially conservative Family Institute of Connecticut has criticized the legislation, arguing it will create a “safe harbor” for “abortion providers who violate abortion laws in other states.” The bill is considered by some advocates to be one of the most consequential abortion-related proposals to come up for a vote in the Connecticut General Assembly since 1990. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he will sign the legislation in the law if clears the full Democratic-controlled General Assembly.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Sen. Darius Brown has regained his high-profile General Assembly committee assignments, following his acquittal of misdemeanor charges earlier this year. A jury in January found the Wilmington Democrat not guilty of misdemeanor offensive touching and disorderly conduct. A woman accused Brown at the time of hitting her in the head and throwing a drink glass that shattered near her while dining at a Talleyville restaurant in May 2021. Following his arrest, Brown was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired. In November, months after his arrest, Brown reportedly got into a verbal altercation with Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, during a bill-signing press event. That led to Senate leadership stripping Brown of his role on the Bond Committee, a high-profile position that helps write the annual infrastructure spending bill. Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola said in a statement Tuesday he has reinstated Brown to these positions due to his “acquittal in court and my belief that the terms of these sanctions have been appropriate.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden plans to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner – the first time a sitting president will be at the event since Barack Obama in 2016. The organization said in a tweet that it was pleased to host Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the dinner April 30 that will honor the First Amendment. Donald Trump opted to skip the event when he was president, and it was canceled in 2020 and last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” is serving as the event’s entertainer. In 2018, Michelle Wolf’s biting, after-dinner comedy routine grabbed headlines, even in Trump’s absence. After the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington earlier this month, some of those who attended, including Cabinet members, other administration officials and members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 amid a surge of cases around the nation’s capital. Capacity for the upcoming dinner is more than 2,600, and the event is fully booked. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, suggested last weekend that the correspondents’ dinner should move forward. He told “Fox News Sunday” that “we are at the point in this pandemic” where “I think we can gather safely.” The association is requiring full vaccination and negative same-day coronavirus tests.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As critics decried a congressional redistricting map submitted by Republican Ron DeSantis as racially motivated and drawn to benefit the GOP, the staff member who crafted the maps told lawmakers Tuesday that he didn’t take race or party politics into consideration in preparing it. Lawmakers were called back to the Capitol for a special session to approve new congressional districts after DeSantis vetoed the maps they approved last month. The GOP House and Senate leadership opted not to try drawing maps again but rather to take up one submitted by DeSantis. His plan would likely add more Republican seats than the maps the Legislature approved and could mean the four districts where Black voters have the best chance of selecting a candidate would be reduced to two. Five of the current 27 U.S. House members from Florida are Black – one a Republican from an overwhelmingly white district. J. Alex Kelly, DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, said the map is “race neutral.” Democrats reject that argument. Several Black lawmakers have called DeSantis racist for submitting the map. Rep. Angie Nixon said other lawmakers chastised her for previously using that language, but at a rally before session began, she repeated her opinion and said she won’t be silenced. “That’s what he is,” Nixon said in an interview afterward. “It’s all racially and politically driven. And this is the type of systemic racism that they don’t want us to talk about. It’s because it makes them uncomfortable because it shows people who they truly are.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is appealing a federal judge’s ruling allowing a challenge to her eligibility to run for reelection to proceed. A group of voters last month filed the challenge with the secretary of state’s office alleging that Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. They say that violates a part of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Greene said the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is unconstitutional, and she filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to prohibit state officials from enforcing it. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg on Monday ruled that the challenge can proceed. Greene filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The provision of the 14th Amendment cited in the challenge says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Greene has denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection. The challenge, filed on behalf of the voters by a group called Free Speech for People, is set for a hearing before an administrative law judge Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Images of a Hawaiian monk seal being born on an Oahu beach have been captured on camera. An employee of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources shot video and photos of the pup emerging from the mother onto white sands last week. “As soon as its (amniotic) sac burst, the little one starting wiggling around,” Lesley Macpherson, who works for the department’s Division of State Parks, said in a news release Tuesday. The mother monk seal checked on her pup by barking as the newborn flapped its flippers. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species. There are only about 1,400 seals in the world. About three-quarters of this total live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a remote string of small atolls northwest of Hawaii’s populated islands. The rest, about 300 seals, live in the Main Hawaiian Islands including Oahu and Maui. The pup, named PO5, was one of two baby seals born on Oahu last week. Officials and volunteers will actively monitor the moms and their pups until weaning in about five to six weeks. After weaning, officials will aim to tag the pups and may apply temporary satellite transmitters to the seals to help keep track of them. Three other pups born on Oahu this year died from complications related to birth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court has allowed lawmakers to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law they passed earlier this year that would ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The court on Monday approved a request by Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder and the Legislature to take part in the case. The law is modeled after a Texas law that is enforced through civil lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges. The Idaho law had been scheduled to take effect Friday but was temporarily blocked by the court following a lawsuit by a regional Planned Parenthood organization. Lawmakers said Planned Parenthood’s arguments challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law “directly implicate the Legislature’s authority.” The law allows the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a “preborn child” to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist’s relatives could. The bill passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law but said he feared it would “in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a state budget that aims to soften the blow of inflation with $1.8 billion in tax breaks and direct payments to Illinois consumers – an outline Republicans derided as an election-year ploy. The $46 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 also makes substantial investments in debt and savings backed by tax revenues virtually no one predicted a year ago amid a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker, who faces reelection this fall, said in a news release from Chicago that the fiscal outline “brings real improvements to the lives of working families and sets us up for a stronger fiscal future.” He said the funding for schools, updated highways and transportation systems, and paying down obligations in the state pension programs “are the kind of priorities we can invest in when our state is governed responsibly.” Pritzker rolled out his plan in February, when national inflation was at about 7% – the highest in 45 years. The package includes tactical strikes at rising prices: suspending the 1% grocery sales tax, freezing the motor fuel tax increase and offering a one-time $350 property tax refund, totaling $970 million in money consumers could keep or get back.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: There won’t be a balloon release at this year’s Indianapolis 500 in May. For the past two years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off on the pre-race balloon release largely due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the amount of staff on site. But this year, according to vice president of communications Alex Damron, the decision has taken into account the environmental and wildlife impacts – issues critics have raised for years. Speedway officials said they want the pre-race events to bring about unity as a way to honor military heroes, celebrate sporting excellence and build excitement. “We do recognize the release has become more divisive in recent years,” Damron said. “We’ve received significant feedback from groups and individuals opposed to it as well as an increasing number of our fans.” The balloon release has been a yearly staple at the event for more than 70 years. Environmentalists have been calling for the release – one of the few regular large balloon releases that have still been happening across the country – to end for years. Though the balloons are released in Indianapolis, they can travel quite far. In 2018, one woman even found what she believed to be an Indy 500 balloon in Ohio, 100 miles away. When the balloons land, they make their way into the ecosystem and the food chain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two years after fourth grade teachers at Andrew Jackson Elementary asked their students to consider whether the school should change its name, five members of the school’s student leadership team presented their arguments for renaming the school to the Des Moines School Board on Tuesday. The renaming project was waylaid when schools closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, teachers began discussing moving forward with the name change. Bettina Bradley, a reading and math interventionist, advocated letting students lead the project. At this week’s Des Moines School Board meeting, the students highlighted Jackson’s ownership of enslaved people and his signing of the Indian Removal Act, the 1830 law that authorized the president to negotiate the removal of Native Americans from their homelands to federal land – a move that led to thousands of deaths on the Trail of Tears. “The name Jackson is important to our school and community, as we are the stars,” student Keren Moran said, referring to the school’s mascot. “So we’re asking the board to rename Andrew Jackson to Mary Jackson Elementary.” Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. Her story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of two former Sedgwick County sheriff’s employees accused of stealing cash, drugs and weapons from the department’s evidence unit has been sentenced to a suspended jail term and one year of probation. Marc Gordon, 47, was sentenced after pleading guilty earlier this month to one count of official misconduct and three counts of theft, all misdemeanors, the Wichita Eagle reported. He was sentenced to a year in jail, which was immediately suspended, and placed on probation for a year. Gordon would be subject to having the jail term reinstated if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. Prosecutors say Gordon was a property and evidence technician with the agency when he and a property and evidence supervisor, 55-year-old Robert White, stole more than $7,700 in cash, several pounds of cocaine, meth and other drugs and several samurai-style swords. The missing evidence led the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office to dismiss or review dozens of drug cases. White pleaded guilty in January to 12 counts, including felony official misconduct, drug distribution and thefts. He is set to be sentenced on April 29.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The last stockpiles of a deadly chemical agent in the U.S. have been safely eliminated, according to Kentucky officials in charge of destroying the Cold War-era weapons. The final M55 rocket containing VX nerve agent was destroyed Tuesday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent plant. Officials began disassembling about 18,000 of the rockets and draining the VX agent in July, according to a news release from plant officials. Candace Coyle, the plant’s project manager, said Wednesday that the nation’s entire stockpile of VX nerve agent “is now completely destroyed.” VX is considered the deadliest of the chemical agents that were produced by the U.S., much in the 1960s. It has a consistency similar to motor oil, and even a tiny amount causes victims’ bodies to flood with fluids, producing a feeling of drowning before death. Officials in 2017 declared that assassins used VX agent to kill the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. The central Kentucky Army depot still has 277 tons of other chemical agents left to be destroyed, after beginning with more than 520 tons of VX, GB and mustard agent that was in storage for decades. Officials said it all should be gone by next year after it began eliminating its mustard agent stockpiles in 2019.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Legislation to keep transgender athletes from competing on college and K-12 women’s and girls’ sports teams has been approved by the state Senate with little debate. The Advocate reports that the bill by Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, passed Tuesday evening on a 29-6 vote. It goes next to the state House. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed similar legislation last year, saying it was mean-spirited, unnecessary and could result in loss of NCAA events in the state. He has not said what he would do were the bill to pass this year. The measure would apply to K-12 schools, as well as colleges and universities, if they receive state funding. “Athletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall not be open to students who are not biologically female,” the bill says. Opponents say there are no known transgender athletes currently competing in the state, and the legislation adds to discrimination against an already marginalized group. Mizell said the NCAA hasn’t gone through with threats to pull events from states with similar laws.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a bill to create a public-private partnership to help grow the state’s aerospace industry. Supporters envision the corporation as a central hub for innovation and economic development in the state’s air and space industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, said the effort has been years in the making. “The Maine Space Consortium will bring together business, research and state leaders, to help ensure Maine continues to be at the forefront of this industry,” Daughtry said in a statement. Members of the air and space industry have taken an interest in Maine in recent years, in part because it is home to the former Loring Air Force Base and Brunswick Landing, formerly a naval air station. The state’s geography and existing infrastructure make it a candidate to serve as a site for small launches, industry members have said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The addition of about 80 acres to the Pocomoke State Forest through legislation makes an elevated walkway connecting Snow Hill directly to the park possible. HB882, signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan this month, was co-sponsored by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester. According to a statement by Carozza, the project would create a trail network from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City “and has significant social, recreational and economic benefits.” This Maryland Department of Natural Resources project would add the acreage to Pocomoke State Forest as new type of wildlands and would exempt approximately 2 acres for the trail’s construction. She also confirmed in a statement that “the trail will be developed through a collaborative planning process between the Maryland Forest Service, Maryland Park Service and the Town of Snow Hill.” The public hearing on this project was held Oct. 28, 2020, and 98% of the 122 comments were in strong support of the project, including multiple organizations and local government agencies.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A gate separating affordable housing from the new playground at Coes Park was unlocked Friday. Community activists celebrated, having seen the locked gate as a symbol of environmental injustice and racism. “It felt like modern-day segregation,” said Nelly Medina, an organizer with the Tenant and Housing Alliance of Worcester and a Lakeside Apartments resident who spearheaded the fight to unlock the gate. “They got $1.2 million from saying it was in an environmental justice community, and they locked the gate. It put white people on one side and (Black, Indigenous and people of color) people on the other.” But Alex Corrales, director of the WHA, said unlocking the gate was simply a seasonal task. “It’s springtime – that’s all it is,” Corrales said in an interview. “We had been opening it for years, during the summer program for children, and they would do swimming classes, have canoes, but we would not leave it open permanently because we were concerned with safety.” Corrales bristled at the idea of any injustice and said the plan was to open the gate “indefinitely.” “We will obviously monitor the situation in terms of communicating with residents and the community,” he said. “If there are incidents that really put the safety risk of residents involved, we do want to review that very closely.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: A judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bonds for the jailed parents of a teenager who is charged in a shooting at his high school that left four students dead. Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews said that James and Jennifer Crumbley’s actions before their Dec. 4 arrests in a commercial building in Detroit were meant to conceal their whereabouts. “The defendants indicate they were devastated when they heard about the alleged actions of their son, felt unsafe in their home, felt hounded by the press and found it necessary to leave,” Matthews said. “The chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the defendants leaving their home is not consistent with cooperation with law enforcement.” The Crumbleys had disappeared the day before after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The parents are accused of failing to keep a gun secure at home and failing to reasonably care for their son when he showed signs of mental distress. They have pleaded not guilty. “Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” Matthews said. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge by environmentalists over portions of a lower court ruling involving a key permit for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals in January reversed a 2018 decision by state regulators to issue PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It sent the case back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for further proceedings. That was a win for environmentalists, but they’re challenging other parts of the ruling. One prong involves the agency’s decision to issue the permit without setting specific effluent limits on mercury and other pollutants. They also faulted the appeals court for not imposing consequences for the agency’s alleged effort to dissuade the federal Environmental Protection Agency from submitting critical written comments during the water permit review process. “It is so important that Minnesota agencies be held accountable when they circumvent laws that were meant to protect the integrity of the regulatory process,” said Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, one of the three parties that asked the Supreme Court to step in. The other petitioners are the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A state prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from violence, failing to meet their mental health needs, failing to take adequate steps for suicide prevention and relying too much on prolonged solitary confinement, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The department released findings of its two-year investigation of the state’s oldest prison, Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The probe started after an outburst of violence in late 2019 and early 2020. “The problems at Parchman are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision,” the department said in its report. It said the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has been on notice of these deficiencies for years and failed to take reasonable measures to address the violations, due in part to non-functional accountability or quality assurance measures.” “Years of MDOC’s deliberate indifference has resulted in serious harm and a substantial risk of serious harm to persons confined at Parchman,” the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of Justice’s civil rights division, said 10 homicides and 12 suicides have occurred among inmates at Parchman since 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A bill passed by the state House on Tuesday would put restrictions on how race is talked about in public K-12 schools. The GOP-led House on Tuesday voted 85-59 in favor of the bill, with some Republicans opposing the measure. It now goes to the GOP-led Senate. The legislation would ban schools from teaching “that individuals, by virtue of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.” The measure also bans schools from compelling students and teachers to affirm that “individuals of any race, ethnicity, color, or national origin are inherently superior or inferior.” Students, parents or teachers could file complaints alleging violations of those bans with the state education department or Missouri attorney general. Supporters argued that the bill is needed to prevent classrooms from being used to indoctrinate children. But critics said the measure could have a chilling effect and might scare educators away from having difficult discussions about race and American history. “America’s history is not squeaky clean,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley said. “We need to be open-minded about that and have the hard conversations and not be scared to talk it through.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city commission has voted 4-1 to deny an appeal from local marijuana dispensary owners over a Safety Inspection Certificate and to bring forward a proposed referendum package regarding adult-use marijuana sales on the ballot this November. City staff will work with city commissioners to get a referendum on the ballot. Janelle and Dale Yatsko, owners of Green Creek Dispensary in Cascade County, applied for a Safety Inspection Certificate, handled by Great Falls Fire Rescue as an annual inspection for businesses within city limits, for the operation of an adult-use marijuana dispensary within city limits in February. GFFR and the City Attorney’s Office advised that their application likely not be processed, according to the agenda background. Legal counsel for the Yatksos, Attorney Raph Graybill, reached out to the City Attorney Jeff Hindoien to argue that “state law entitles the Yatskos to operate their adult-use marijuana business within City limits; any contrary policy is preempted by state law.” The city responded denying the SIC on the basis of a local ordinance that has been in place for medical marijuana and federal law regarding marijuana but said the Yatskos could appeal the decision, which they did.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts touted the tax cuts lawmakers approved this year as they wrapped up their session Wednesday. Ricketts said the $900 million package of income and property tax cuts that the Legislature approved this year delivered “the most significant tax relief bill we have ever had in the state of Nebraska.” He signed the bill last week. Lawmakers took care of their business quickly Wednesday because Ricketts didn’t veto any of the bills they sent to him this week. Ricketts also praised bills the Legislature passed that will lay the groundwork for a canal project to divert water out of Colorado and study the creation of a major new lake along the Platte River between Lincoln and Omaha. Lawmakers also made plans to spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic relief money, including a package of $335 million to help economic recovery in parts of Omaha and other high-poverty areas in the state. And Ricketts said the Legislature made important investments in public safety including improvements at the state law enforcement training center and setting aside money for a potential new state prison.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator, lauded as a headquarters for Burning Man artists, has a new space and a new mission. The arts and maker space reopened this month after signing a 10-year lease with Foothill Partners, developer of the much anticipated Oddie District – a 187,000-square-foot mixed-use space just east of U.S. 395 in Sparks, next to Goodwill. The Generator currently takes up about 70,000 square feet, about twice the size of its former home on Icehouse Avenue in industrial Sparks. Eventually, about half the space will be given to another tenant. “Any time there’s a lot of people in a space making art, it makes us all feel better, right?” said Jessi “Sprocket” Janusee, communications director for the Generator, also lovingly known as The Genny. Since 2013, local and international artists alike have used the space to assemble colossal sculptures, from temples to whales to ships, before sending the installations into the desert to burn. While it continues to be a magnet for Burning Man creations, staff at the Generator say the goals of the space are now more community-driven. Still run by a cast of established Burners, the team is placing a much heavier emphasis on community outreach year-round.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Theo Martey, a teacher of West African drumming and dance and a songwriter, is the state’s next artist laureate. Martey, nominated by Gov. Chris Sununu, was confirmed by the Executive Council on Wednesday for the two-year, honorary position. He had received the Governor’s Arts Award for Arts Education in 2019. Born in Accra, Ghana, he has more than 33 years’ experience as a performer and arts educator across three continents. He has lived and worked in New Hampshire for 20 years. Martey has taught more than 5,000 workshops to students from first grade through high school, college and university students, and in communities. “For over two decades, I have been invited into dozens of schools across New Hampshire as an artist in residence, working with students so that they may experience West African drumming and dance hands-on,” Martey said in a statement. “To be named artist laureate is an honor, and I look forward to continuing to use music to empower others to discover their best selves and promote the importance of arts across the state and the region.” Martey is the state’s ninth artist laureate since 1997.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A Catholic diocese has agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle claims involving clergy sex abuse with some 300 alleged victims in one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic Church in the United States. The agreement between the Diocese of Camden, which encompasses six counties in southern New Jersey on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and plaintiffs was filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden on Tuesday. The settlement must still go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge. If approved, the settlement would exceed the nearly $85 million settlement in 2003 in the clergy abuse scandal in Boston, although it’s less than other settlements in California and Oregon. “I want to express my sincere apology to all those who have been affected by sexual abuse in our Diocese,” Bishop Dennis Sullivan said in a statement. “My prayers go out to all survivors of abuse and I pledge my continuing commitment to ensure that this terrible chapter in the history of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey never happens again.” Details about what allegedly happened to the roughly 300 victims were not included in the proposed settlement, according to Jeff Anderson, an attorney for some 70 of the victims, who called it “a powerful advance in accountability.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with a U.S. agency undergoing a multibillion-dollar modernization effort that includes the production of plutonium cores for the nation’s nuclear arsenal celebrated the opening of a massive office complex Tuesday. Jill Hruby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, joined other officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Years in the making, the new complex on the edge of Albuquerque will replace a collection of two dozen military barracks and other buildings, some of which date back to the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II. Officials said some of the old buildings were compromised by asbestos and lead paint and were well past their lifespans. The new building boasts enough space to cover more than five football fields and will end up saving the agency an estimated $40 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. It includes a data center for rows of servers, conference rooms and secure spaces. Construction was supposed to wrap up last year, but officials said pandemic-related labor and material shortages resulted in delays.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: A widely seen video of an 8-year-old Black child sobbing as he’s being led into a police car over a bag of chips was called “heart-wrenching” Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said more needs to be done to build trust with communities of color. The video taken Sunday shows a white officer holding the clearly distraught youth from behind by his elbows, leading him from a sidewalk to the back seat of a police vehicle. Another officer says the situation is about “stealing stuff.” The man recording the video argues with police to let the child go. The video has been widely shared on social media, with many people condemning the officers for treating the child roughly. Hochul, at a COVID-19 briefing in Syracuse, said the video was difficult to watch. “We have more work to do, and I know that the mayor is working closely with the police department to get to the bottom of everything,” said Hochul, a Democrat. “But also make sure that we do protect our children – that they’re handled in a different way when it comes to encounters with law enforcement.” Syracuse police said Tuesday the officers’ actions were being reviewed, along with body-worn camera footage. Police said the incident involved an accusation of youths stealing from a store.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to give a judge another week to work through the latest step in a long-running legal fight over public education spending. The court’s justices granted Special Superior Court Judge Michael Robinson a seven-day extension, which he had requested Tuesday while citing differences between the legal parties over details and numerous documents to review. Robinson was tasked last month with scrutinizing the November order of another judge who had directed that $1.75 billion be moved from state coffers to carry out two years of a remedial plan to address education inequities. In particular, the Supreme Court told Robinson to review Judge David Lee’s order in light of the General Assembly’s passage of a state budget that funds some of the plan’s provisions. Robinson originally had until Wednesday to report his findings to the justices, who afterward will hear appeals that likely would rule on whether the judicial branch has constitutional powers to order taxpayer-funded spending for education on its own. Republican legislative leaders say only the General Assembly can appropriate state money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Holmberg, 79, the state’s longest-serving senator, stepped down from the legislative management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reports Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges but in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reports. He also said he no longer has the texts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A doctor accused of ordering excessive amounts of painkillers that led to multiple patient deaths at a Columbus-area hospital was acquitted of 14 counts of murder Wednesday following a weeks­long trial. Dr. William Husel, 46, was accused of ordering the drugs for patients in the Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook told jurors before the start of deliberations that they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder. They deliberated for six days. Husel would have faced a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 15 years had he been found guilty of just one count of murder. Prosecutors presented their case beginning Feb. 22 and put on 53 prosecution witnesses before resting on March 29. Those witnesses included medical experts who testified that Husel ordered up to 20 times as much fentanyl as was necessary to control pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Emergency responders, National Guardsmen, children, parents, grandparents, members of Congress, City Council members, students and college professors united Tuesday in their desire to remember the 168 lives lost in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building 27 years ago. In spite of the somber reason for the gathering, laughter and joyful conversation were heard among the crowd of nearly 1,000 people filling the pews of Oklahoma City’s First Church ahead of the annual Day of Remembrance Ceremony. The ceremony was moved inside the church east of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum out of concern for chilly temperatures and wind gusts Tuesday morning, but by the time the crowd followed the bagpipers to the Field of Empty Chairs to place flowers on them, the sun was shining brightly. Speakers partaking in the program included Gov. Kevin Stitt, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “When you see your fellow human beings as Republicans or Democrats – not as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters – then you have begun the process of dehumanization. You are paving the path to horror,” Holt said. “That memorial is a symbol of that path’s inevitable conclusion.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon State Treasury has at least $5.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, a coalition of environmental groups said in a report Wednesday that blamed the state for adding to global warming and urged divestment. Oregon is considered a “green” state, through its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by state agencies and being the first state to commit to stop using coal-fired power. Yet the state treasury is working at cross-purposes with over $1 billion invested in the coal industry alone, Divest Oregon said in its report. “The state exposes Oregonians to climate and health risks, economic costs, and financial losses” through the investments, the group said. The amount that Oregon has invested in oil, gas and coal companies – whose products are a leading cause of global warming – is probably far higher than $5.3 billion because the numbers that Divest Oregon obtained from the state treasury through a public records request do not include private equity investments, which are not subject to public disclosure. The state treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency’s spokesperson was tied up in a meeting Wednesday of the Oregon Investment Council, which makes investment decisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The federal fraud trial of a City Council member and his wife in what prosecutors alleged was a “widespread corruption conspiracy” has ended in a mistrial following a jury deadlock. Jurors deliberated for about 25 hours over four days but were unable to reach a verdict in the case of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and his wife, Dawn Chavous, who were charged with honest services wire fraud in a 22-count indictment. Outside the courtroom, Johnson thanked family, friends and supporters “for just praying for us and showing your support during this very stressful time.” The jury told the judge Monday afternoon that they were at an impasse but deliberated all day Tuesday after being instructed by the judge to do so. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office later said “the government is committed to retrying the case.” Johnson, 46, a Democrat who has served on the council since 2012, was accused of engaging in official actions in exchange for payments. Chavous, 40, was accused of having entered into a “sham” consulting agreement with a nonprofit that was used to funnel payments to her husband. Defense attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support their case, defending the work of Chavous as legitimate and saying it had nothing to do with Johnson’s actions on the council.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The downtown arena known as “The Dunk” will keep its name at least through June. Dunkin’ Donuts’ two-decade-old naming rights deal for the building expired Wednesday, but the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority has agreed to a short-term extension through June 30 while it vets new proposals, Executive Director Daniel McConaghy said Tuesday. At the start of this month, the Convention Center Authority went out to bid for new naming rights proposals from companies looking to display their brand to hockey and basketball fans or drivers speeding past on Route 95. Unlike the previous naming rights deal, which included only the arena, this time the authority plans to include the rights for the next door Rhode Island Convention Center, according to the Request For Proposals. While Dunkin’ Donuts – now known as Dunkin’ – may put in a bid to keep the name, it is likely to face competition. And the fact that the doughnut chain didn’t come to an agreement to extend the deal before it went to a formal bidding process may be a sign it has moved on. The arena was built by the City of Providence in 1972 and was originally known as the Providence Civic Center. Dunkin’ first bought the naming rights to the center in a 2001 deal valued at $8.65 million over 10 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: A performer who scared a group at a haunted house was shot by a man who said he thought he was grabbing a prop gun as part of the experience, police said. The employee at the Zombie Experience at the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach was hit in the shoulder and survived, authorities said. The man told investigators the group fell to the ground after the performer scared them Saturday, and he felt a gun hit his foot, Myrtle Beach Police said in a statement on Facebook. The man thought the gun was not real and was part of the experience and fired twice, police said. The performer spoke at the suspect’s bond hearing and said the man looked at him before firing. He said since the shooting, he is struggling to work and can’t sleep. So far, the man has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he gave the gun to a 15-year-old after firing it even through he was told it was real, authorities said. Police said they are still trying to determine where the gun came from, and additional charges are likely.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Avera Health has plans to build the state’s largest pickleball facility. The health care provider will construct 12 outdoor courts at its Avera on Louise Health Campus in Sioux Falls at a cost of about $1.5 million. Pickleball is a sport that’s recently grown in popularity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Combining elements of tennis, badminton and pingpong, it’s played indoors or outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Two or four players can play with simple equipment that involves paddles and a plastic ball with holes. Jason Askew is executive director of Sports Medicine for Avera and said the organization wants to appeal to people of all ages. “Being able to offer something for adults that is growing by leaps and bounds in popularity, both here in Sioux Falls and around the country, is a lot of fun to be able to announce,” Askew said, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Askew said construction will take a few months, and Avera anticipates the free courts will open to the public by early August.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican officials have removed three congressional hopefuls from the GOP primary ballot, including one candidate backed by ex-President Donald Trump. The late Tuesday night decision by the Tennessee Republican Party was a long-awaited result of months of debate over Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s former State Department spokesperson, entering Nashville’s open 5th Congressional District race. Even with Trump’s endorsement, some Republicans criticized the selection after pointing out that she had just recently moved to the state and did not know the region or its voters. Tennessee’s GOP-controlled Legislature had sought to nudge Ortagus and others off the ballot by imposing residency requirements on most U.S. House and Senate candidates. However, that attempt fizzled after the state’s election office told the Associated Press the legislation – which Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee allowed to go into effect without his signature earlier this month – would not apply retroactively to candidates who had already met the qualifications. That left the decision up to the state Republican Party, who had received challenges over the voting records of Ortagus, as well as video producer Robby Starbuck and small-business owner Baxter Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Former state lawmaker Wendy Davis sued Tuesday over the most restrictive abortion law in effect in the U.S., nearly a decade after her 13-hour filibuster of another anti-abortion measure made her an overnight Democratic star. The lawsuit is the latest attempt to halt the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Courts have repeatedly turned back multiple other challenges and kept the law in place since September. That includes both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court, defeats that left attorneys for Texas abortion clinics acknowledging that their path to stopping the law had effectively shut. Like past challenges, Davis calls the law unconstitutional but a takes a different legal approach, suing a Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who earlier this year accused Citigroup of circumventing the law by offering to pay travel expenses for employees who go out of state to seek an abortion. Cain did not immediately respond to an email sent Tuesday evening. The suit also names three private citizens who Davis accuses of using or threatening to use the law’s unique mechanism that enforces the law only through private lawsuits. Davis’ filibuster propelled a failed run for governor. She also lost a bid for Congress in 2020 and now works with abortion funds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As warmer weather draws more people to get out and enjoy the sunshine, officials are urging anyone heading out into the state’s great outdoors with their pets to keep their dogs on leashes. Dogs can have a serious impact on wildlife and on landscapes, and any left off-leash while in nature could act on their instincts to chase deer and other animals, wildlife officials said Tuesday as they issued a statewide request for dog owners to take the issue more seriously. Utah wildlife often struggles to find food during the winter and can be vulnerable and weak come springtime, according to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “If they get chased, it uses up energy they may need to survive,” said Covy Jones, the Big Game coordinator at UDWR. “These animals are already depleted, and they often can’t afford to waste energy. If you or a pet force them to move away from where they are trying to feed, it could be harmful.” Deer and other big game animals typically move to lower elevations in search of feed during the snowy winter months, which typically brings them closer to roads and to people and pets. Dogs that are off leash can also disturb nesting ground birds and can chase, injure or kill small mammals, deer, elk or moose, according to the DWR. Utah law states that a person may kill or injure a dog that is “attacking, chasing or worrying any species of hoofed protected wildlife.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The second of four men accused in a failed plan to build a biotechnology plant in Vermont using tens of millions of dollars in foreign investors’ money raised through a special visa program was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 18 months in prison. William Kelly, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of concealment of material information. As part of the plea deal, eight other charges were dropped and he agreed to cooperative with the government. Kelly was indicted in 2019 on multiple fraud charges along with Miami businessman Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts in northern Vermont, and former Jay Peak president William Stenger. Kelly was an adviser to Quiros. The indictment accused the men of conspiring to devise a scheme between 2011 and 2016 to defraud foreign investors in the AnC-Bio project in Newport. The EB-5 visa program encourages foreigners to invest in U.S. projects that create jobs in exchange for a chance to earn permanent U.S. residency.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After two years of pandemic-enforced absence, Tom’s Cove Park campground will again welcome hungry seafood lovers as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival – appropriately themed “Long Time ... No Sea!” – returns for its 52nd year May7. The Chincoteague Chamber-sponsored event is held the first Saturday in May to promote the seafood industry on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The festival offers fresh, local seafood and signature dishes from local restaurants as well as old and new Eastern Shore favorites prepared by festival cooks, volunteers and professionals, according to the chamber. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the ticket price, with beer available for purchase. Front Page News will provide live entertainment, and festivalgoers can shop an arts and crafts tent featuring handmade creations from area artisans. Ticket sales have been brisk due to the two-year hiatus, according to the chamber.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A citywide “day of service” in May will offer thousands of volunteer opportunities in an event Mayor Bruce Harrell hopes will be a symbol of how his administration plans to beautify the city. Rather than a budget boost or a new devotion of city resources, Harrell is appealing to civic goodwill to help clear litter, weeds, debris and graffiti, The Seattle Times reports. More than 80 city-organized cleanup and volunteer events will take place May 21. Some of the options include picking up litter in Ballard, clearing trails in Jackson Park, working on community gardens in the Chinatown International District, sorting donations at downtown shelters and building tiny homes near the Duwamish River. “This is going to be symbolic of how we’re going to get things done in our city,” Harrell said Monday. “People want to help. Employers want to help; employees want to help.” Everyone who volunteers for the day of service, Harrell said, will a sense of self-fulfillment that they did something about a problem rather than just complaining, along with a T-shirt. The city annually spends about $3.7 million on graffiti removal and has the equivalent of about 15 full-time employees devoted to the problem. Harrell said he’s not yet sure if the city needs to devote more money to it. Volunteers can register at seattle.gov/dayofservice.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A former director at a hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired after he raised concerns about the safety of patients who were on ventilators and receiving other respiratory care services during a surge of COVID-19 cases. Mark Mustard was fired as director of cardiopulmonary and therapy services at Princeton Community Hospital in September 2021. His departure from the West Virginia University Medicine affiliate came amid the surging delta variant of the coronavirus “at a time when respiratory care was crucial to the community,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Mercer County Circuit Court. Mustard, then 63, alleges he was terminated after he reported concerns about the quality of medical care being provided as the number of patients requiring respiratory care increased during the pandemic. Mustard was “highly outspoken” about the need for more staff in the respiratory services department “in order to provide an adequate level of care to its patients and the community,” the lawsuit said. He was not warned that his job was in jeopardy or given a reason for the termination, which came less than one month after he received an “exceptional” performance review that included an incentive bonus of more than $6,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Communities are encouraging residents to keep their lawnmowers in the garage next month to boost the population of bees and other pollinators. Appleton became the first city to adopt the “No Mow May” initiative a couple of years ago, and others have followed, including Wausau, Oshkosh, Fort Atkinson and Stevens Point. The idea is to give homeowners the option of letting their lawns become a bit overgrown for a few weeks to ensure that bees coming out of hibernation have plenty of options for the nectar and pollen they need, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Cities temporarily waive enforcement of ordinances that require homeowners to maintain their lawns. This year, the initiative has spread even farther, to La Crosse, Wisconsin Rapids, De Pere and other communities. “Bees, and insects in general, are in a bit of a slump right now,” said Israel Del Toro, a biology professor at Appleton’s Lawrence University. Studies have shown steep declines in wild bee populations in the 21st century. The United Nations characterizes it as a threat to the global food supply. Del Toro said many factors are hurting bee populations, including climate change and irresponsible uses of pesticides and herbicides. But in his view, the biggest stressor is habitat loss. Del Toro said there is plenty of room for compromise. People can plant native flowers or allow growth only in parts of their yards.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A utility company estimates a new law requiring carbon-capture systems be added to coal-fired plants could cost the average customer an extra $500 a month, WyoFile reports. Black Hills Corp. said in a filing with the Wyoming Public Service Commission that the measure passed by the Legislature in 2020 could cost it as much as $1 billion per coal unit, according to the news outlet.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/03/deity-purgatory-virgin-snake-birth-slug-dough-traps-news-around-states/118529798/", "title": "'Deity' in Purgatory, virgin snake birth: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Jordan-Hare Stadium will officially be at full capacity for Auburn football games in 2021, the university said in a release outlining what game days will look like this year. Face coverings are recommended but not required in open-air spaces, the release said. However, the university requires masks in indoor spaces, so fans using elevators, premium indoor seating or transit buses will need to bring them. While some schools such as LSU are requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test for stadium entry, Auburn is not. Tiger Walk will be back, but the team’s pregame procession into the stadium will be shortened. The traditional pregame war eagle flight is also returning this year. The marching band will be allowed on the field for pregame and halftime festivities after being prohibited from the field last season. The university is encouraging fans to use digital ticketing through mobile devices. Merchandising and concessions inside Jordan-Hare will be cashless and contact-free, but game programs will still sell in and around the stadium for $10 cash.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Plastic is no longer a choice when checking out from stores in Anchorage. A ban on plastic bags is back in force in Alaska’s largest city after a temporary suspension during the pandemic, Alaska’s News Source reports. As of Wednesday, the option when checking out is paper or reusable options. The ban first took effect in 2019, but Assembly member Felix Rivera said it was relaxed during the pandemic in part because the supply chain for paper bags was disrupted. There were also concerns about whether reusable bags could transmit the coronavirus, he said. “I think since last year, we’ve learned a lot about the virus, and now nothing that I am reading leads me to have a lot of concern about reusable bags transmitting the virus,” he told the Anchorage television station.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In a process that some people call a “virgin birth,” a Brazilian rainbow boa was born at the Phoenix Zoo with DNA from only one parent. Its mom, who has been at the zoo for 10 years, has never been paired for mating. Imagine the keepers’ surprise when the baby boa was discovered in the snake’s enclosure Aug. 3. The snake was likely born through parthenogenesis, in which one – or multiple – eggs mature without fertilization. The zoo believes this is the second documented birth of its kind among Brazilian rainbow boas. Mom is currently in the Boa Hut on the Forest of Uco Trail, and the zoo plans to house the baby in a reptile nursery on the Children’s Trail. So-called virgin births, or asexual reproduction, may not be that uncommon among vertebrates. Thelma, a reticulated python at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, gave birth to six baby pythons without a partner in 2014. “Once considered an evolutionary novelty, facultative parthenogenesis has now been documented in an increasing number of vertebrate species, ranging from the hammerhead shark to domestic turkeys, komodo dragons to snakes,” Warren Booth, an associate professor of molecular ecology at the University of Tulsa who studies the phenomenon, said in a statement in 2016.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several inmates say they weren’t told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used for that purpose. Three inmates at the Washington County jail said they didn’t know they were being given ivermectin until its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said it’s heard similar complaints from inmates. The inmates’ comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail’s physician that use of the drug was voluntary. “They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work,” said William Evans, who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for the virus. The drug’s manufacturer, Merck, said in February that it had found no evidence ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients. Edrick Floreal-Wooten said he was given ivermectin after testing positive Aug. 21. “I asked what are they, and they’d just tell me vitamins,” Floreal-Wooten said. He said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates. “Never. I’m not livestock,” he said. “I’m a human.” The ACLU said it has also heard from inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon force large department stores to display some child products in gender-neutral ways after the Legislature passed a bill Wednesday aimed at getting rid of traditional pink and blue marketing schemes for items like toys and toothbrushes. The bill would not outlaw boys and girls sections in department stores but would require retailers to have a gender-neutral section to display “a reasonable selection” of items “regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys.” It would only apply to department stores with 500 or more employees, so most small businesses would be exempt. It also wouldn’t apply to clothes, just toys and “childcare items,” which include hygiene and teething products. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly for a procedural vote before it heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. If it becomes law, California would become the first state to require these sections in stores, according to the office of Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, the bill’s author. He said the measure was inspired by a 10-year-old whose mother works in his legislative office. “Britten asked her mom while shopping why certain things in a store were ‘off limits’ to her because she was a girl but would be fine if she was a boy,” Low said. “Thankfully, my colleagues recognized the pure intentions of this bill and the need to let kids be kids.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Three suburban police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative in a fatal encounter that provoked national outcry during racial injustice protests last year. The grand jury indictments announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Phil Weiser are the latest chapter for the police department in the city of Aurora, which has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. McClain’s death helped inspire a sweeping police accountability law in Colorado, a ban on chokeholds and restrictions on the use of the sedative ketamine, both of which the indictment alleges contributed to his death. The charges were announced days after the second anniversary of when police stopped McClain on the street after a 911 caller reported a man who seemed “sketchy.” “What I set out to do is still not over, but I’m halfway there. I’m halfway there,” McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, said of her efforts to hold police accountable. Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over last year and has pledged to work to restore public trust, said the department will continue to cooperate with the judicial process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nFarmington: A small jet crashed shortly after taking off from a small airport Thursday morning, killing all four people aboard, officials said. The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the building has been accounted for, and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said. Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida overnight, officials said the city was seeing historic flooding Thursday. The Wilmington Fire Department and other agencies were performing water rescues, and many streets and bridges remained closed, officials said. Flooding affected several neighborhoods, and a Wilmington Fire Department spokesperson said crews had rescued 60 to 80 people by noon. Delaware Department of Transportation Community Relations Director CR McLeod said the flooding was affecting homes and businesses, and there were many vehicles underwater, WDEL-FM reports. More than 50 bridges would need to be surveyed and assessed, he said. “A lot of this water is coming down from Pennsylvania with the excessive amounts of rain that they had associated with the storm yesterday,” McLeod said. “All that water is going to make its way down toward the Delaware River, and it’s all coming down the Brandywine.” The Brandywine entered a major flood stage Wednesday night, and by Thursday morning it reached a maximum crest of 23.1 feet, a new record, according to the National Weather Service. Waters began to recede, and the creek was expected to fall below flood stage early Friday, according to the agency.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital ranks last in the country for teacher pay compared to other jobs, WUSA-TV reports, citing a study from business.org. The July study compared the average salary of primary and secondary school teachers to the average salary for all jobs within each state and the district. The data was collected using the National Center for Education Statistics and compared with the salaries of all occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results found that D.C. and Virginia rank last in the country, with educators earning 17% and 10% less than the average wage, respectively. Virginia and D.C. are among seven states that the study claims pay teachers below the state’s average salary. The study reports that Mississippi has the lowest salary for teachers at just more than $45,000 per year, but that is still 8.6% higher than the average salary in the state. Pennsylvania ranked highest in the country, according to the study, with teachers earning 30% more than the average wage.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An elementary school was placed in a temporary, limited lockdown after a parent threatened to leave his job and confront an assistant principal for telling his children they couldn’t come to school without being masked. Christopher Kivlin was met by police officers Tuesday outside Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota. No charges were filed, but he was ordered not to come back to the school without calling first and getting permission. An incident report said Kivlin showed up to campus saying the school was violating the law by not allowing his children to attend school. The Sarasota County school district is among a dozen of Florida’s 67 districts, representing about half of the state’s 2.8 million public school students, that have defied Gov. Rob DeSantis’ executive order barring schools from requiring masks over parent objections. A judge last week ruled that DeSantis did not have the authority to issue the order. The DeSantis administration is expected to appeal the decision. Kivlin told television station WFLA he had no intention of hurting anyone but just wanted to talk to a school official. He apologized for scaring anyone and said that “it was just emotions built up.” “I found out after the fact that the school had to go into lockdown, I was like, ‘That’s horrible,’ ” Kivlin said. “I feel like I might have scared other parents.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge’s decision striking down a Trump-era rule that eliminated federal protections for some wetlands and streams is giving hope to opponents of a proposed mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge in southeast Georgia. A federal judge in Arizona on Monday tossed the rule that narrowed the types of U.S. waters that qualify for federal protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. The judge’s order, which applies nationwide, says the rule enacted under former President Donald Trump improperly limited the scope of clean water protections. One high-profile project directly affected by the environmental rollbacks under Trump was a proposal by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals to mine titanium dioxide on land about 3 miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge near the Georgia-Florida line. Conservationists fear mining close to the swamp’s edge could cause irreparable harm to the largest federal wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. Yet the Army Corps of Engineers declared last year that the project no longer required a federal permit because the rollbacks under Trump excluded wetlands on the site from federal protection. That left sole authority to Georgia state regulators to decide whether it could move forward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tourism officials have released a plan to reduce visitors on Oahu, the state’s most frequently visited and populous island. The plan was approved by the Hawaii Tourism Authority in July, and the full plan has now been released to the public, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Decreasing the total number of visitors to Oahu to a manageable level by controlling the number of visitor accommodations and exploring changes to land use, zoning and airport policies,” the plan says. It also establishes a regenerative tourism fee, creates reservation systems for natural and cultural sites, manages visitors’ use of cars, and promotes consumption of locally produced and sold goods. “We appreciate the Oahu residents who participated in the (plan) process and passionately contributed their diverse viewpoints, discussed various tourism-related challenges in their neighborhoods and helped set forth an actionable plan that is necessary for the community’s well-being,” said John De Fries, the Hawaii Tourism Authority’s president and CEO. “It’s about continued collaboration and moving forward together to malama (care for) this cherished place and each other, as desired by the people of Oahu.” The three-year plan was developed by community members and county officials in collaboration with the tourism authority.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: At least two state lawmakers received threatening letters concerning their votes on a law intended to drastically reduce wolf numbers. The anonymous letters to Republican Sen. Dan Johnson and Republican Rep. Caroline Troy say that “just as the wolf went from predator to prey, so shall you.” It’s not clear how many more lawmakers received the letters. The Lewiston Tribune reports some of the lawmakers contacted the Idaho State Police. Backers of the wolf law that took effect July 1 said the state can cut the number of wolves to 150 before federal authorities would take over management. That would be a 90% reduction of the state’s 1,500 wolves. The letters describe lawmakers as “nothing more than a sellout to the Cattle Association and that pitiful minority of cattle producers that seemingly dictate how our wildlife lives and dies.” Johnson said the envelope had a Sacramento postmark, and the return address was the Statehouse in Boise. “It’s OK for people to disagree with my votes or my bills, but some comments cross the line,” he said. “I think this letter comes close to the line, if not stepping over it.” The law passed the Senate 26-7 with no support from Democrats. It passed the House 58-11 with one Democrat in support and no Republicans opposed.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Rowers, kayakers and other users of the Chicago River are getting a real-time look at one measure of water quality in the system that weaves through downtown and several neighborhoods. Chicago nonprofit Current installed three sensors in the river’s three main branches in 2019 to continuously estimate the amount of bacteria from human and other warm-blooded animals’ waste. The organization initially planned to begin making the real-time results public in 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic delayed its plans until Thursday, when a website updating with data taken every 15 minutes went online. The city’s development in the 19th century was thanks to the river – truly a system of rivers and manmade canals – that provided a path between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River system. While the meatpacking and lumber industries could use it for shipping, the waterway also became a dumping ground for those and other industries and for sewage from homes and businesses. Quality of the 156-mile river system has improved in recent years, helped by multibillion-dollar construction of new reservoirs and underground tunnels. But when rain overwhelms Chicago’s sewer systems, sewage and stormwater is diverted to the river, prompting warnings to stay off the water for several days.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Schools got an incentive from the governor Wednesday to require face masks in classrooms in hopes of slowing down the number of COVID-19 outbreaks among students. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a new statewide executive order that eases quarantine requirements for students if all children and adults in the school were wearing masks throughout the day. The revised order comes as many Indiana schools have seen COVID-19 outbreaks and as the state’s vaccination rate remains stubbornly low. Holcomb said the coronavirus’ spread in Indiana was regrettable but avoidable. “To the skeptics or unbelievers or deniers, I would just plead to look at the facts, to look at the numerical data that shows we can all stay safe if you get vaccinated,” Holcomb said. Meanwhile, the state’s largest hospital system will be stopping all inpatient nonemergency surgeries as the state faces a growing surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Indiana University Health announced Thursday that the surgery suspension would start Monday. The decision comes after IU Health said last week that it was cutting such surgeries by half. IU Health, which operates 16 hospitals around the state, also said that more than 1,000 employees did not meet Wednesday’s deadline to get COVID-19 vaccinations and would be suspended immediately.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A federal judge on Thursday ordered a prominent participant in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to return to jail after he was caught accessing the internet to watch false conspiracy theories about the presidential election. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said Doug Jensen, 42, of Des Moines, had violated the strict conditions that were set when he was released from jail July 13, including prohibitions on accessing the internet and using a cellphone. Prosecutors had moved to revoke Jensen’s pretrial release Aug. 19, days after a federal officer found Jensen in his garage using an iPhone to watch news from Rumble, a streaming platform popular with conservatives. Jensen acknowledged that he had earlier watched two days of the cyber symposium sponsored by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who used the event to push false theories that the 2020 election’s outcome was changed by Chinese hackers. Kelly noted that he had released Jensen from jail in July after Jensen claimed he had an awakening behind bars and realized the QAnon conspiracy theory to which he adhered was a “pack of lies.” The judge said it was significant that Jensen’s violations were caught during the first unannounced visit to his home by pretrial services officers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: About a third of Kansas nursing homes have less than half of their health care workers vaccinated against COVID-19, according to data released by the state. Just four of the more than 300 federally licensed nursing homes are meeting the state’s goal for 90% of health care workers vaccinated, the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services and Kansas Department of Health and Environment data shows. The departments released the data about a week after President Joe Biden announced that his administration will require nursing home staff to be vaccinated as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving federal Medicare and Medicaid funding. The department for aging and disability services said in a statement last week that it released the data to prepare for those new rules. Gov. Laura Kelly’s office said in a statement, without offering details, that the administration would encourage nursing home workers to get inoculated. As of Wednesday, about 46% of Kansans were fully vaccinated, according to data provided by the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A judge has refused to grant a divorce decree to a couple who swore under oath that their marriage was irreparably broken. The reason, she said: They were too nice to each other in court. In a decision condemned by divorce lawyers, Bullitt Family Court Judge Monica Meredith at least temporarily declined to dissolve Douglas and Nicole Potts’ 13-year marriage, which both insist can’t be salvaged. In an Aug. 23 order continuing the case and suggesting the couple undergo counseling, Meredith observed they were “respectful and courteous toward one another, and both held themselves in dignified and mature composure.” Meredith, who was elected to Family Court in 2018, said that “divorce court does not typically bring that demeanor out in its participants.” But in interviews and emails, a half-dozen family lawyers said Meredith’s order was inappropriate, unlawful and ridiculous. “It sends a terrible message to litigants: You are better served by acting like a petulant child in court than by acting mature,” said Louisville attorney Hal Helmers, who wasn’t involved in the case. Louise Graham, professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky’s Rosenberg College of Law, said counseling may be ordered only if one side disagrees the marriage is over. “Ninety-nine percent of divorce lawyers agree with the above, and we can never agree on ANYTHING,” Helmers said in an email.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: Photos show what appears to be a miles-long oil slick near an offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Ida, according to aerial survey imagery released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reviewed by the Associated Press. The government imagery, along with additional photos taken by the AP from a helicopter Tuesday, also show Louisiana port facilities, oil refineries and shipyards in the storm’s path where the telltale rainbow sheen typical of oil and fuel spills is visible in the water of bays and bayous. Both state and federal regulators said Wednesday that they had been unable to reach the stricken area, citing challenging conditions in the disaster zone. The NOAA photos show a black slick floating in the Gulf near a large rig with the name Enterprise Offshore Drilling painted on its helipad. Aerial photos taken by NOAA on Tuesday also show significant flooding to the massive Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery along the bank of the Mississippi River, just south of New Orleans. In some sections of the refinery, rainbow sheen is visible on the water leading toward the river. Asked about reports of levee failures near the refinery Monday, Phillips 66 spokesman Bernardo Fallas said there was “some water” in the facility and stressed that operations were shut down before the storm.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Newly unionized nurses at Maine Medical Center are frustrated over the end of pandemic accommodations. The policies had let high-risk employees work outside COVID-19 care, covered COVID-19 treatment costs, provided quarantine pay for coronavirus exposure outside the workplace and allowed pregnant nurses to start paid maternity leave in the last month of their pregnancy. “In the middle of a spike in infections from a fast-moving variant, this is not the time to remove the protections that have helped both staff and patients here for the past several months,” nurse Madison Light said. The surge is causing nurses to scramble to staff the COVID-19 units. They’re not getting enough breaks, they said. “Now it feels like there is no end in sight. Nurses and caregivers are exhausted, frustrated, and stretched to their physical and emotional limits,” Light said. MaineHealth said its policies on COVID-19 exposure and pregnancy leave follow current clinical and OSHA guidelines. Accommodations for high-risk employees are considered on a case-by-case basis, the company said.\n\nMaryland\n\nThurmont: First responders in western Maryland used a boat to rescue 10 children and a driver from a school bus caught in rising floodwaters as the remnants of Hurricane Ida dumped heavy rainfall Wednesday afternoon. Frederick County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Todd Wivell said the bus got stuck when it tried to cross a bridge in the Thurmont area that had water going across it, WTOP-FM reports. The driver and 10 children were rescued from the bus by boat, with the help of first responders from the sheriff’s office and the Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, he said. Even 6 inches of moving water is enough to knock a person off their feet, Wivell said. Frederick County Public Schools recalled all school buses that were in the process of dropping students off. Parents were asked to pick their kids up from school buildings. Frederick County Public Schools’ Superintendent Terry Alban apologized after facing criticism for not dismissing children early, saying the decision to remain open for a full day led to “stress and anxiety for many,” The Frederick News-Post reports. School systems in neighboring counties sent students home early ahead of forecasted inclement weather.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A question that would require voters to present an ID and a second that would grant new benefits for drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft while stopping short of declaring them employees have cleared an initial hurdle on their way to next year’s ballot. Other proposed initiatives that received a constitutional green light from Attorney General Maura Healey’s office Wednesday would legalize the sale of fireworks, create a “whale safe fishing act,” allow for the return of “happy hours,” and create a “Right to Counsel Program” for those facing eviction. The questions were among 16 proposed laws and one proposed constitutional amendment that met the requirements for ballot initiatives outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution, according to Healey’s office. Another 13 proposals were deemed unconstitutional. The state constitution requires proposed initiatives be in the proper form to present to voters, not be substantially the same as any measure on the ballot in either of the two preceding statewide elections, contain only subjects related to each other and not involve topics specifically excluded from the ballot initiative process.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Thousands of Flint residents were put at potential risk because a New York law firm, for six months, used handheld X-ray devices to scan their bones for lead without first registering the devices and putting recommended safety measures in place, documents obtained by the Detroit Free Press show. Starting in about August 2020, the Napoli Shkolnik firm used the portable scanners – which are tools in the mining and scrap metal industries but are not designed for use on humans – as a way of bolstering residents’ claims for larger shares of a proposed $641.25 million settlement of civil lawsuits arising from the 2014 lead poisoning of Flint’s drinking water supply. The law firm’s failure until February 2021 to register the devices with the state of Michigan, as required by law, and the state’s low-key response once it learned the scanners had been used for months without required approvals add insult to the injury that was the Flint drinking water crisis. “Unfortunately, thousands of bone scans using these devices ... went forward under improper and illegal circumstances,” said Dr. Lawrence Reynolds, a Flint pediatrician and former president and CEO of Mott’s Children’s Health Center, who first raised concerns about the scanners in a February court filing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Attorneys for three former police officers charged in George Floyd’s death asked a judge Thursday to bar their upcoming trial from being livestreamed, saying some witnesses won’t testify if the proceedings are broadcast. The request from attorneys for Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao is an about-face from their earlier request to have the trial publicly broadcast, and it is opposed by prosecutors and news outlets. Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to stand trial next March on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 2020 death. Their co-defendant, Derek Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter after weeks of proceedings that marked the first time in Minnesota that a criminal trial was livestreamed in its entirety. Before Chauvin’s trial, attorneys for all four men requested the trials be broadcast, but Lane and Kueng recently backtracked, with their attorneys saying that the “worldwide publicity” from televised coverage of Chauvin’s trail “crushed” their clients’ right to a fair trial. Attorneys Earl Gray and Tom Plunkett say the public access led some witnesses to decline testifying for the defense, noting one witness in the Chauvin trial has been harassed and another faced professional scrutiny.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: The U.S. Marshals Service has arrested a man in connection with an assault on an MSNBC reporter during a live broadcast from the state Monday. Benjamin Dagley was taken into custody Thursday afternoon at a shopping center in Dayton, Ohio, according to a report. With the assistance of the public, the Gulfport Police Department identified Dagley, of Wooster, Ohio, as a suspect in an assault on Shaquille Brewster as he covered Hurricane Ida. Dagley allegedly pulled up in white pickup truck and ran toward the camera crew. The suspect could be heard off-camera repeatedly screaming something about reporting the hurricane accurately. Brewster attempted to go on with the live coverage, even shifting his position to move away from the suspect, but when he realized the accused was not backing down, Brewster tossed it back to the studio. As the camera faded, viewers could see Brewster being physically confronted. Gulfport police issued warrants Tuesday charging Dagley with two counts of simple assault, one count of disturbance of the peace and one count of violating emergency curfew. Police also said Dagley is on probation for a previous charge in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state senator from Kansas City said he is demanding answers after an exhibit on the gay rights movement in Missouri was removed from the state Capitol. Democrat Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay member of the Missouri Senate, said he was “appalled” when he was told the exhibit, “Making History: Kansas City and the Rise of Gay Rights,” had been removed from the Missouri State Museum. Connie Patterson, spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources, did not immediately reply to questions about why the exhibit was moved and who made the decision. On Tuesday, Uriah Stark, legislative aide for state Rep. Mitch Boggs, R-La Russell, posted pictures of the exhibit on Facebook and questioned why the “taxpayer funded museum is pushing the LGBT agenda in our state capitol?” The next day, Stark thanked “several of our great elected officials” for having the exhibit removed, specifically mentioning Republican Reps. Ann Kelley, of Lamar, and Brian Seitz, of Branson, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “There is NOTHING controversial about an exhibit that explains how members of the LGBT community fought to end persecution and demand rights as citizens,” Razer tweeted Thursday. “I’m extremely disappointed and angry that @mostateparks may think otherwise.”\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park is ending its reservation requirement to travel on the Going-to-the-Sun Road after Labor Day as the busy summer season winds down. The reservation system has been in place for anyone wanting to travel on the scenic highway since May 28. Reservations were required between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. The pilot program testing the reservation system worked to alleviate traffic, but park officials said some people struggled to find available tickets. The park’s shuttle service will also end after Labor Day.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government is stepping in to help shuffle patients between local hospitals that are dealing with a surge of people with COVID-19 and other health issues, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. The Republican governor said the state has partnered with Nomi Health, the creators of the TestNebraska program, to offer call centers that overcrowded hospitals can contact when they need to transfer patients elsewhere. The around-the-clock call centers will serve as coordinators for in-state hospitals to try to keep them from getting overwhelmed, at a cost of $200,000 a month. The announcement is another sign that the state is once again struggling with coronavirus cases, even though most of the hospitalizations are patients without the coronavirus. State officials opened a similar call center last year but ended the program after the number of cases and hospitalizations declined. The new call center is scheduled to open Saturday. Nebraska’s hospitals reported to the state Wednesday that 72% of their 3,234 beds were occupied, although some facilities were far more crowded and having to send patients to other places. Ricketts relaxed licensing restrictions for nurses last week in an attempt to fix severe staffing shortages.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. said Wednesday that a conference scheduled next month in Las Vegas by a group espousing the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon won’t be held at any Caesars property. It wasn’t immediately clear if the “Patriot Double Down” event organized by Patriot Voice would be moved, postponed or canceled. Caesars Entertainment executive Kate Whiteley confirmed a Las Vegas Review-Journal report that the Oct. 23-25 event billed as a “Great Awakening Weekend” won’t be held at the new Caesars Forum convention space near the Las Vegas Strip. With tickets from $650 to $3,000, the conference was billed to feature speakers including former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and 8kun website owner Jim Watkins. QAnon is a theory featuring the baseless belief that satanic pedophiles, child sex traffickers and cannibals are in collusion with the so-called deep state and will be uncovered at a reckoning followers call a “Great Awakening.” QAnon signs are often seen at rallies for ex-President Donald Trump, and some adherents are facing trial for roles in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The group also derides the COVID-19 pandemic as a “plandemic,” suggesting the coronavirus was manufactured and its severity exaggerated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Dartmouth-Hitchcock says it’s experiencing staff shortages during the coronavirus pandemic that range from nursing positions to food service workers. The health care system said Wednesday that it organized a “Managing and Staffing to Capacity” task force to identify solutions to the shortage, especially in the inpatient units and other care areas at its flagship hospital in Lebanon. Dartmouth-Hitchcock also began planning for reallocation of resources and staff. Earlier this year, it increased the starting rate for newly licensed nurses to $30 per hour and made wage adjustments for experienced clinical nurses and nurse supervisors. It plans to provide a 2% wage increase for other staff beginning in October. Joni Menard, task force leader, said that “the overall situation continues to be challenging as clinical demand increases and the supply of traveling staff is depleted across the nation.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Murphy administration officials used an unapproved encryption app at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and deleted correspondence “on at least one occasion,” according to new court records. The alleged use of the encrypted messaging application Telegram by Department of Health officials shows the limits of New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act and the ability to skirt them and other laws and rules, experts said. Lawyers for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy revealed that health officials were communicating on Telegram in the administration’s latest legal filing in the whistleblower lawsuit brought by Christopher Neuwirth, an assistant health commissioner who was fired shortly after first-wave peak of the coronavirus. In a 308-page response countering Neuwirth’s claim that he was improperly fired last May, Murphy’s lawyers said Neuwirth required employees who reported to him “use a non-state-approved messaging application – Telegram – furthering burdening those state employees.” The Open Public Records Act does not specifically address encrypted messages but does include emails and text messages used for official business in its definition of government records. Such records are subject to public access unless they fall under one of more than two dozen exemptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta officials say they’re canceling some parts of the event and will require guests to wear masks to enter the grounds and while in indoor areas and crowded outdoor settings to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said Wednesday he didn’t believe that face mask requirements and other safety practices would affect attendance numbers for the Oct. 2-10 event. “Masks have been a way of life that we’ve all been experiencing for the past year or more, so I think it’s one of those things that people are used to,” he said. The music fiesta is being canceled this year due to close proximity of guests, and the discovery center is being shelved because of its indoor nature featuring activities with multiple touchpoints, officials said. Other steps being taken include providing cashless options to buy tickets, moving hospitality seating outdoors and increasing spacing between popular special-shape balloons inside the park, officials said. The changes track federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and the current public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The Democratic-led Legislature voted Wednesday to extend an eviction and foreclosure moratorium for commercial and residential tenants who fell behind on their rent because of hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, had called the Legislature to return for an “extraordinary session” to pass the legislation, which will put evictions on hold until Jan. 15. New York’s previous eviction moratorium, which included foreclosure protections for property owners, expired Tuesday. In an Aug. 12 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court nixed part of the moratorium that allowed tenants to pause eviction proceedings simply by filing a form declaring they’d had a COVID-19-related financial hardship or that moving in a pandemic would prove a health risk. The court said landlords should have the ability to challenge those hardships in court. New York is poised to change how the moratorium works in light of that ruling. Landlords will be able to challenge hardship declarations and direct judges to require tenants with hardships to apply for rental assistance. Hochul said the legislation will stand up to legal scrutiny. But the leader of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest organization of landlords in New York, vowed Wednesday to sue to block the moratorium in federal court.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The majority of public school students taking standardized state exams in reading, math and science last school year failed them, data shows. State education leaders cautioned against making year-over-year comparisons with the tests taken during a school year marked by limited in-person instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 45.4% of K-12 students passed the exams for the 2020-21 school year, according to results released at a State Board of Education meeting Wednesday. Two years ago – the last time testing was required – nearly 59% of K-12 students passed state exams. The U.S. Education Department did not require states to test students in the 2019-20 school year but required it this past year to assess pandemic learning loss. Because of coronavirus safety concerns, some high school students this past year took exams months after completing the course on which they were being tested. Some tests were revised, and a lower-than-normal share of students took them, news outlets report. “While the 2018-19 data is included as a way to provide context, comparison of the two years should only be made with a recognition that multiple anomalies occurred during the 2020-21 school year and during test administration,” state board member Jill Camnitz said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A lawmaker who heads the state’s anti-abortion legislative caucus said Thursday that it’s likely the Republican-led Legislature will seek to pass a measure mirroring a new Texas law that virtually bans all abortions and that the Supreme Court has allowed to remain in force. GOP Sen. Janne Myrdal, one of the Legislature’s most ardent anti-abortion lawmakers, said she “assumes” legislation will be crafted eventually that uses the Texas law as a template. “I hear people talking about it,” Myrdal said. About a third of the Legislature’s 141 members are active in the caucus, which already has successfully pushed some of the nation’s toughest abortion laws. If it is drafted, it’s unclear when it would be introduced, though it could happen when the Legislature meets later this year in a reconvened or special session meant to deal with legislative redistricting. North Dakota is one of several states that have so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its landmark 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Myrdal said the high court’s action – or lack thereof – offers “a glimmer of hope” the court might eventually overturn Roe v. Wade because of its shift to the right following the appointment of three conservative justices by former President Donald Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief this week launched an effort to purge inactive voters from state rolls, while using the announcement to push for passage of a bill making several changes to Ohio’s election process. The four-year process for purging inactive voters targets those who have not voted for two years and whose addresses may have changed and whose voter registration must be updated to reflect the move, according to Wednesday’s directive by GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose to Ohio’s 88 county elections boards. Inactive voters can keep themselves on the rolls by voting in any election in the next four years, submitting an absentee ballot application, registering to vote or taking other election-related steps. Earlier this year, LaRose said 97,795 inactive voter files were removed in scheduled post-2020 election voter roll maintenance, a lower number than predicted after thousands of voters avoided the purge by voting and undertaking other election activities. In his announcement Wednesday, LaRose also urged for the passage of a Republican voting bill introduced this spring that prohibits the placement of ballot drop boxes anywhere but at local elections offices, eliminates a day of early voting, shortens the window for requesting mail-in ballots and tightens voter ID requirements.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge on Wednesday said she will temporarily block a state law banning public school mask mandates, but students or their parents can opt out of the requirement if they choose. Judge Natalie Mai said she will issue a temporary injunction that will go into effect next week when she issues a written order detailing her ruling. Mai said she is blocking the law because it applies only to public, not private, schools, and schools adopting a mask mandate must provide an option for parents or students to opt out of the requirement. The ruling drew praise from Gov. Kevin Stitt, who signed the law and opposes mask mandates without exemptions, and Dr. Mary Clarke, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, which joined the lawsuit brought by four parents who oppose the law. “This is a victory for parental choice, personal responsibility and the rule of law,” Stitt said in a statement. Clarke said she was also pleased with the ruling. “This is just a first step in ensuring our schools maintain local control and can choose the best path for their students, faculty and staff,” Clarke said in a statement.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Slugs and snails love bread dough, finds recent research from the Oregon State University Extension Service and other universities, suggesting a cheap, easy-to-make, nontoxic and widely available solution for gardeners and farmers alike. The state’s grass seed industry loses roughly $100 million a year to the slimy pests, according to the Oregon Seed Council. “Slugs and snails have a big impact on seed crops,” said Roger Beyer, the council’s executive director. “Our guys will work with anything, be it biological, pesticides or chemicals – whatever it takes to protect their crops, but it has to be economical.” The Oregon Seed Council provides $60,000 to $70,000 a year to fund slug and snail research at OSU, including for the work of gastropod specialist Rory McDonnell, who participated in the multi-university study that discovered bread dough attracts the pests. McDonnell and his fellow researchers ran simple experiments comparing how slugs and snails are attracted to different foods, essentially pitting foods in head-to-head contests until one was determined the most attractive. Cucumber was an early front-runner, and beer and strawberries did well, but bread dough was what really called the mollusks to dinner. McDonnell said it might be deployed in the creation of molluscicides, but dough should work for now.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change passed its last regulatory hurdle Wednesday, in a hard-fought bid to make Pennsylvania the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. The plan to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants won a 3-2 party-line vote from the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, a five-member panel of gubernatorial and legislative appointees. The commission voted after almost six hours of testimony and nearly two years of Wolf’s administration working on the regulation and shepherding it through the long regulatory process. The vote allows Pennsylvania, through regulation, to join a multistate consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By joining the consortium, “Pennsylvania is taking a historic, proactive and progressive approach that will have significant positive environmental, public health and economic impacts,” Wolf said in a statement after the vote. Mark Szybist, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it the “most important climate action that Pennsylvania has taken in more than a decade.” At 34%, Pennsylvania’s energy sector is its largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: Some residents will be paying more for their health insurance next year, but not as much as insurers wanted them to pay, the state Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner said Thursday. The rate increases for 2022 approved by Commissioner Patrick Tigue were lower than insurers has requested. “As Rhode Islanders confront significant threats to their health and financial well-being due to the spread of COVID-19, my responsibility is to limit the burden of the cost of health insurance within the standards for review and approval set forth by law,” Tigue said in a statement. “Given the strong reserve positions of health insurers operating in the state, I did not believe that charges for profit and contributions to reserves for 2022 were consistent with the proper conduct of the insurers’ business or consistent with the public interest.” Rhode Islanders will save almost $42 million in 2022 compared to what the commercial health insurers requested, his office said. For Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which has 40,255 members in its small group plan and requested an average rate increase of 2.9%, Tigue approved a 0.3% decrease. Gail Carvelli, a spokesperson for BCBSRI, told The Boston Globe the company accepted the modifications and recognized the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s highest court on Thursday tossed out a school mask mandate in the capital city, saying it contradicts a state budget measure aimed at preventing face covering requirements. State Attorney General Alan Wilson had sued Columbia after the City Council passed the ordinance requiring masks at elementary and middle schools. City leaders said the mask requirement, which carries a $100 violation fine, was meant to protect children too young to be approved for COVID-19 vaccines. But Wilson argued the city’s mask rule conflicts with the budget requirement that went into effect July 1 and bans school districts from using appropriated funds to require face coverings. On Thursday, the state Supreme Court sided unanimously with the attorney general. The Columbia ordinance is written so that the burden of enforcing the mask rule falls on school employees, “all of whom have an obvious connection to state-appropriated funds,” wrote Justice John Kittredge. That means school employees have to choose between violating state or city laws, the opinion said. “The City has made clear that every school employee is in the crosshairs,” Kittredge wrote.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers looking to remake the state’s voter-passed medical marijuana law previewed a coming battle in the Legislature on Wednesday as they recommended outlawing growing the plant in homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. A legislative subcommittee approved a spate of recommended changes to a ballot measure approved by 70% of voters last year. The law is set to take full effect in the coming months as the state government faces deadlines to issue medical marijuana identification cards and provide for the licensure of dispensaries. However, the law will continue to be in flux. Republicans, who dominate the Legislature, are currently debating just how far to go in changing the law. The subcommittee on Wednesday recommended changes that could potentially make it more difficult for people in rural areas to access the drug – most significantly by striking all provisions allowing medical marijuana ID-card holders to grow cannabis plants in their homes and allowing local governments to prohibit dispensaries. The recommendations will next face approval by the Marijuana Interim Study Committee before they can be passed to the full Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state Department of Education video celebrating the return to school drew sharp criticism across social media. The 41-second video released Tuesday features Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who shares her own memories of excitedly starting school as a kindergartner. “All of our students – 1 million of them – across the state of Tennessee are starting the school year right now,” Schwinn says. “The smell of new books, clean hallways, the energy and feeling of being back in classrooms with their friends and their teachers. It’s such a special time, and I am so excited for our state.” She then asks parents to share stories about why they are excited for the new school year in the comments. The video received swift feedback from parents and teachers experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, quarantines and a growing number of schools already closing as the coronavirus spreads. As of Wednesday, Tennessee was averaging a record-setting 2,330 infections per day among school-age children, ages 5 to 18, according to state data. “How tone deaf do you have to be to ask parents to ‘share their stories’?” commenter Joshua Allen said on Facebook. Several commenters said they sent kids back to school after 18 months of avoiding the virus only to have their children exposed or infected within a few weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The state on Wednesday became the 20th and largest in the nation to allow some form of the unregulated carry of a firearm. Under the new law, most people 21 or older who haven’t been convicted of a felony can carry a holstered handgun – concealed or otherwise – in public without undergoing any training or getting a permit. Supporters of the law, including Gov. Greg Abbott and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature, laud it as a necessary expansion of the so-called constitutional carry movement that will allow people to more easily defend themselves without government interference. But critics, including some law enforcement groups and others, say this further loosening of firearms restrictions in a state that has had more than its share of mass shootings is reckless. Until Wednesday, Texans needed a license to carry a handgun outside their homes and vehicles. To get one, they had to submit fingerprints, go through several hours of training on gun laws and gun safety, and pass a shooting proficiency test. Now, they can still take an online training course that the law requires the state to provide, but it is not necessary. While recent mass shootings have put many on edge, Texas has cultivated a strong culture of gun ownership with echoes of the Wild West, and many residents support the loosened restrictions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A suspect charged with setting fire to three churches in the city and then leading police on a high-speed chase across Washington County that didn’t end until he crashed his minivan inside Zion National Park told police he was a “type of deity” who was acting in “righteous anger.” The man was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on seven separate charges, including two second-degree felony counts of arson and a third-degree felony count of failing to stop for a police officer, according to a report filed in 5th District Court. Local fire officials and federal agents had been investigating the string of fires as a possible hate crime, as all three happened at houses of worship of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. The suspect, a 36-year-old identified as Benjamin Johnson, was being held without bail. The police report suggests investigators worried that he could be a danger to the community and that his mental health was a consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A refugee resettlement organization is offering to accept about 100 Afghan refugees over the next several weeks if its proposal is approved by the U.S. State Department. Amila Merdzanovic of the Vermont chapter of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants said that if the request is approved, the state’s well-publicized housing crisis will prompt her organization to look for families to host at least some of the new arrivals. It would not be the first time refugees arriving in Vermont lived with host families. “In the 1970s and 1980s when Laotians and Cambodians were coming into the state, there was no refugee resettlement program, so people were being hosted by Vermonters,” said Merdzanovic, who came to Vermont in 1995 as a refugee from Bosnia and Herzegovina and lived with a host family when she first arrived. “That’s the model we are looking to implement.” She said Thursday that since word of the proposal first became public Wednesday, she has already received dozens of messages of support. Historically, Vermont has not been a location where refugees with the types of visas granted to the Afghans have been resettled. Merdzanovic said last week she was not expecting any Afghans, but she learned Aug. 25 that refugee resettlement agencies had two days to submit proposals.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the state can remove an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a prominent spot in its capital city, saying that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The 7-0 decision cited testimony from historians that the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the Southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. More than a century later, its continued display “communicates principles that many believe to be inconsistent with the values the Commonwealth currently wishes to express,” the justices ruled. The high court’s decision came in two lawsuits filed by residents who attempted to block Gov. Ralph Northam’s order to remove the bronze equestrian sculpture, which shows Lee in military attire atop a massive stone pedestal. Virginia promised to forever maintain the statue in the 1887 and 1890 deeds that transferred its ownership to the state. But the justices said that obligation no longer applies. “Those restrictive covenants are unenforceable as contrary to public policy and for being unreasonable because their effect is to compel government speech, by forcing the Commonwealth to express, in perpetuity, a message with which it now disagrees,” the justices wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, the state’s most populous county is reinstating outdoor mask mandates for large events and strongly encouraging people to wear masks in other outdoor settings when they can’t remain 6 feet apart. In a statement Thursday, Public Health – Seattle & King County said as of Tuesday there will be a requirement for face masks for outdoor events of 500 or more people. The directive applies to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people over age 5. The recommendation for outdoor masks when people are unable to socially distance from non-household members is also for people 5 and up regardless of vaccination status. “With high rates of disease spread, and our health care system straining to keep up, it is time to take additional steps to keep ourselves and our communities safe,” the health agency said. King County, which includes Seattle, is home to about 2.2 million people. Just last week County Executive Dow Constantine had boasted that King County had one of the highest vaccination rates of any large county in the U.S. As of last week, more than 70% of people 12 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal mine officials have instructed state environmental regulators to propose a change to West Virginia’s mine cleanup program. The federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is giving the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection 60 days to submit an amendment to its reclamation program, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. An Aug. 23 letter from federal officials to state officials said a review found that the program “has not taken sufficient steps” to make sure reclamation obligations are estimated correctly. Such a failure can lead to unfunded environmental liabilities, the letter said. “The WVDEP recognizes the concerns raised in OSMRE’s notice related to reporting and disclosure and those issues will be addressed,” Environmental Protection Department Secretary Harold Ward said in a statement Wednesday, without specifying what kind of amendment the agency plans to submit. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s review of the state’s reclamation program follows lawsuits filed by environmentalist groups.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Calling the situation horrific and inexcusable, city, county and state leaders said this week that they are committed to doing what it takes to improve conditions that leave Black renters in Milwaukee far more vulnerable to electrical fires than anybody else in the city. “These people paid for a place that ultimately took their lives,” said State Sen. LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, who represents part of the city most affected by suspected electrical fires. “That’s inexcusable. ... I have no choice but to find a way to get this addressed. I honestly didn’t know that people were literally losing their lives and everything they own like this.” Johnson said she plans to reach out to Gov. Tony Evers’ office and work with colleagues in the Legislature to consider changes that could help tackle the problem. The reaction follows a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that uncovered how suspected electrical fires disproportionately harm Black renters in the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and how systems at all levels of government fail to address the underlying issues. “It’s gut-wrenching,” Evers said. “It’s very disheartening.” Evers said he already has spoken to staff members about potential ways to address the problem, which he blamed largely on legislative changes in the last decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city expects to face labor shortages across all industries as school-related coronavirus cases spike, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Quarantines and illnesses among children are forcing parents to stay home with their kids, according to the paper, and the problem has already caused issues at day cares.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/08/gingerbread-destruction-raffle-toilet-paper-pyramid-tiehms-buckwheat-news-around-states/40960031/", "title": "Gingerbread destruction raffle, toilet paper pyramid: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHayneville: A teenager admitted to fatally shooting a sheriff who was attempting to disperse loiterers at a gas station, a state investigator testified Monday. Lt. Shawn Loughridge of the State Bureau of Investigation testified in a preliminary hearing that 18-year-old William Chase Johnson admitted after being arrested that he shot Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams Sr. Johnson is charged with capital murder in the sheriff’s death. Store security video showed the sheriff arriving at a gas station and attempting to disperse a noisy crowd that was blocking gas pumps, the investigator said. He said witnesses indicated Johnson first approached Williams in an “aggressive” manner, and the sheriff told him to return to his vehicle. The sheriff was shot after approaching Johnson’s black Silverado truck, Loughridge testified.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: One of the longest-serving members on the state Supreme Court plans to retire later this year. The Alaska Judicial Council is accepting applications for the seat held by Justice Craig Stowers, who plans to retire effective June 1, according to Mara Rabinowitz with the state court system. Stowers, a former Superior Court judge, was appointed to the Alaska Supreme Court in 2009 and later served as a chief justice. Of the current justices, only Daniel Winfree has served on the Supreme Court longer. Winfree was appointed in 2007. The judicial council plans to meet in May to interview applicants. The names of finalists advanced by the council will be sent to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will make the appointment.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Like many city libraries, the one in downtown Tucson is a refuge for homeless people looking for a bathroom, a computer or just a respite. But staff at the Valdez Main Library want to be even more of a resource for men and women having a hard time. For more than a year now, the librarians here have been holding monthly meetings as part of the On the Streets program. Those experiencing homelessness can once a month get a meal and connect with services. The program has helped temper friction that can develop when library staffers have to approach people who are sleeping, bathing or bringing in multiple items. An average of 50 people show up for the monthly sessions. They receive a meal prepared by a local food bank and can choose to stay for the meeting. They get to shape the topics of discussion, too.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials announced Monday that the closure of a hog farm near the Buffalo River has been completed, months after striking a deal with the facility’s owners. Arkansas Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst announced that the terms of the state’s agreement with the owners of C&H Hog Farms Inc. are complete. The shuttered hog farm’s owners have received $6.2 million in state and private funds that was held in escrow since last August, and the state in return now holds a conservation easement for the property. Under the agreement, the state will be responsible for the closure of the waste ponds at the property. Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the settlement with the 6,500-hog farm in Vendor, about 95 miles northwest of Little Rock, which had been the source of controversy since it was permitted several years ago. The Nature Conservancy provided $1 million of the funding.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A team of eye experts has operated on an unusual patient – a gorilla. A cataract was removed Dec. 10 from the left eye of a 3-year-old western lowland gorilla who lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the park announced Monday. The gorilla, named Leslie, was given a muscle blocker to keep her still while a team that included vets along with anesthesiologists and an ophthalmology team from UC San Diego Health removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with an artificial lens that should last for life. The operation was performed at the San Diego Zoo Global’s Paul Harter Veterinary Medical Center. Cataract surgeon Chris Heichel, who led the team and has performed thousands of operations, said it was his first on a gorilla.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An initiative to reintroduce gray wolves to the state has qualified for the November ballot. The secretary of state’s office said Monday that backers of the proposal turned in sufficient valid voter signatures to qualify the measure. The gray wolf has been successfully reintroduced to a number of U.S. states. It was eradicated in Colorado in the 1940s. Colorado ranchers and other interests strongly oppose the initiative, saying it would threaten livestock as well as elk, moose, deer and other animals. The Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund is campaigning for the plan. It says voters have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to introduce the wolf, whereas efforts in other states are directed by federal wildlife officials. If passed, the initiative would direct the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission to devise a plan to introduce wolves on public land west of the Continental Divide before 2024.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestport: Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to appear at a public meeting this weekend to discuss his proposed transportation plan, which could include highway tolls. The town hall-style meeting is planned for Sunday at a school in Westport, where the Democratic governor is expected to be joined by Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti. It will be hosted by state Sen. Will Haskell and state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, both Democrats. A transportation forum that originally was planned for Tuesday evening in Westport had been postponed. “Improving our infrastructure is a top concern for my district. That’s why I’m so excited to host Gov. Lamont and leaders from his administration to hear directly from my constituents at this town hall meeting,” Haskell said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: An 18-year-old man has been charged with throwing an incendiary device at a Planned Parenthood location in the state, a federal prosecutor’s office announced. Samuel James Gulick, of Middletown, was charged Monday in federal court. Security video recorded Gulick spray-painting the phrase “Deus Vult,” a Latin expression meaning “God wills it,” in red letters across the Newark building’s exterior Friday, the U.S. attorney’s release said. Gulick then stepped away, lit an object and threw it at the front window before running for cover. The object exploded, and a fire burned for a minute before going out, the court documents said. Gulick was arrested by the FBI on Saturday after investigators identified his car through the security video and found social media posts under his name containing the same phrase he scrawled on the building, as well as several anti-abortion messages.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The viral art phenomenon known as “Infinity Mirrors” is returning to the Hirshhorn Museum on April 4. The Hirshhorn announced Monday that a mini exhibit of Yayoi Kusama’s work, “One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection,” will be on display through Sept. 20, WUSA-TV reports. The exhibit includes two “Infinity Mirror” rooms, including Kusama’s 1965 installation “Phalli’s Field” and a new room that will be announced soon. An early painting, photographs of Kusama and the 1964 sculpture “Flower Overcoat” will also be part of “One with Eternity.” The Japanese artist has created more than 20 of the mesmeric mirror rooms, allowing visitors to physically partake in the infinite repetition for which her paintings are known.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state’s environmental cops fine polluters today less than half as much as they did a decade ago, before former Gov. Rick Scott took office and shifted state regulators to a more pro-business posture, state data shows. Through the first week of December, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection assessed 352 penalties in 2019, totaling $4.4 million in fines for violating air, water, sewer, petroleum tank and other state environmental regulations. By comparison, in 2010 DEP assessed 1,249 environmental penalties in Florida, totaling $10.2 million – more than 3 1/ 2 times as many penalties and double the fines assessed this year. DEP holds that the lower figures prove the success of the agency’s mission to help businesses, utilities and other polluters to clean up their acts. But the agency’s critics say the steep drop in fines reflects an ever-softening stance.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s police chief has ordered a halt to all police car chases after crashes that killed or injured people. “I don’t want to see us cost someone their life in pursuit of an auto theft person or burglar when the courts aren’t even going to hold them accountable. I mean, how can we justify that?” Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Two men were killed last month in Atlanta when their car was hit by a stolen car evading authorities, police said. The chief said the order will stay in effect while she reviews a chase policy that has been in place since 2018. Changes might include allowing only highly trained officers to take part in chases, Shields said. “I have not heard of any department totally restricting pursuits without some exception” for extreme situations such as active shooters or terrorists, said Jack Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Titusville, Florida.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Road crews are working to repair a section of highway that collapsed into the ocean as some residents question the state’s actions to fight road deterioration. Repair crews began working Sunday on Kamehameha Highway in Hauula after coastal erosion caused the collapse of the shoulder and part of a lane. An area north of Pokiwai Bridge will remain closed until further notice, the Hawaii Department of Transportation said. Ed Sniffen, the state deputy director for highways, estimated the repairs would cost about $120,000 and take about a week to complete. The collapsed area of road is 12 feet long and 6 feet above the beach. Inspectors found the shoulder had been undercut for approximately 20 feet in both directions, the department said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says education funding will be his top priority for the state budget, continuing a theme from his just-completed first year in office. The 65-year-old Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address to lawmakers Monday in what is considered the kickoff to the legislative session. “I am committed to working with you to invest in education, continue reducing regulatory burdens, and increase all Idahoans’ prosperity and quality of life,” Little declared. His budget limits general fund spending growth to 3.75%, a reduction from recent years. His budget leaves a surplus of $60 million and increases the state’s rainy-day funds by $102 million as protection against a possible economic slowdown. The state spends about half its budget on K-12 education, or about $2 billion annually. Little’s budget increases that by about 4%. In particular, Little is keen on increasing the reading ability of young students.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Several recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state were closed Monday, with some owners saying strong demand has caused a shortage in supplies and staff exhaustion. The legal sale of recreational cannabis began Jan. 1 in Illinois, with customers spending about $3.2 million on the first day and more than $10.8 million over five days. By comparison, Michigan, which made recreational marijuana legal Dec. 1, generated $3.1 million in the first two weeks of sales. Neal McQueeney of Midway Dispensary in Chicago said the shop stopped selling recreational product Sunday and doesn’t expect to resume sales until Friday. Jason Erkes said Cresco Labs shut its Sunnyside shops in Chicago, Rockford and Champaign to all customers to “reset” and give his staff a break after working five consecutive 14-hour days.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A recently retired University of Southern Indiana professor already has a new job, as the state’s newest poet laureate. The Indiana Arts Commission says Matthew Graham of Evansville began his two-year term as state poet laureate last week. He succeeds Adrian Matejka, an Indiana University professor. Graham’s duties will include making public appearances at poetry readings or literary events and promoting poetry. Graham is the author of four books of poetry, including “The Geography of Home,” released in 2018. He’s received a number of national, regional and local awards, including a Pushcart Prize, an Academy of American Poets Award and two grants from the Indiana Arts Commission. Graham co-founded and co-directed “The Ropewalk Writers’ Retreat” in the historic southwestern Indiana town of New Harmony.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: To keep up with a sharp increase in passengers, Des Moines International Airport is adding gates to its planned new terminal years before construction even begins. Planned with 14 gates when it opens in 2028, the terminal will instead need 18 to handle the additional load, airport officials said Monday. The extra four gates hadn’t been slated to be built until 2040. The airport will have a combined $60 million in additional capacity-boosting projects, including the $40 million cost of the extra gates. But because the growth in passenger traffic has generated additional revenue, the shortfall in funding for the $500 million project remains at $194 million – similar to two years ago, when airport leaders were looking at scaling back the project to cut costs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly proposed Monday that the state give itself more breathing room in its budget by slashing annual payments to its pension system for teachers and government workers, offering a new version of a plan that the Republican-controlled Legislature spiked last year. Kelly’s proposal would give the state an extra 10 years to close a long-term gap in funding for the state pension system. The move would free up tens of millions of dollars each year for more than a decade, money that could be used for schools and social services. But it’s not clear if her new plan will fare any better than last year’s proposal – which was dead from almost the moment she presented it to lawmakers. The Kansas Public Employee Retirement System projects Kelly’s proposal would increase the cost of closing the gap by a total of $4.4 billion – comparing it to extending the length of a home mortgage.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Humane Society had its largest adoption year on record with about 6,902 animal adoptions in 2019. The Humane Society said it was the first year that cat adoptions outnumbered dogs. In total, 3,424 cats found new homes compared to 3,398 dogs. Adoption officials said cat adoptions have been increasing over the past few years. Humane Society spokeswoman Andrea Blair said cats are popular with seniors, busy families, renters and people who travel for work. Blair said 1,583 cat adoptions took place at Purrfect Day Café, which opened in August 2018. The cafe serves coffee, snacks and cocktails while patrons interact with adoptable kittens and cats. Total adoptions were up 816 from 2018.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Residents who had real Christmas trees to celebrate the holidays are being asked to help the state’s fisheries. Jefferson Parish is seeking volunteers to help with its annual Christmas tree recycling program. It’s the parish’s 30th year doing the project. Volunteers, especially people with shallow draft boats, are needed Feb. 1 to help move the trees out to Goose Bayou, according to Seamus Riley with the parish’s Coastal Management Department. The staging area is at Cochiara’s Marina in Lafitte and begins at 9 a.m. The parish collects trees from residents and uses them to protect Louisiana’s coastline. The trees are used to build wave-reducing fences and to fill in man-made canals, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. In 2019, more than 6,000 Christmas trees were collected in Orleans Parish and airlifted by the Louisiana National Guard into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Biologists with the state Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife are getting ready to round up some moose. Starting this week, biologists will be capturing and collaring 130 moose as Maine’s moose survival study enters its sixth year and focuses on a new study area. The study began in the winter of 2014 in western Maine, and a second study area in northern Maine was added in 2016. Over five years, 475 moose were captured by helicopter-launched nets and fitted with a GPS collar. This year, the program will include a new area north of Moosehead Lake. The collars enable staff to remotely track moose locations and movements over time and to be notified if a moose dies. Adult cows are monitored each spring and summer to determine birth rates and survival rates of calves. For each collared moose, biologists collect detailed health information, including a blood sample, parasite loads, body condition and winter tick loads.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A newspaper’s review of state court records has found an apparent loophole that allows documents filed electronically to be kept from the public. The Capital reports court documents filed through the state’s electronic record-keeping system can be made secret by attorneys, judges and clerks and their staffers without a court order or public notice. In contrast, attorneys who want a record kept secret must obtain an order from a judge when filing by paper. That process requires notice and an opportunity for any interested party to intervene. The newspaper reports it’s unclear how many records have been so easily sealed across the state. In the case of the man accused of opening fire in the Annapolis newsroom in 2018, killing five employees, the newspaper learned through a public records request that almost 70% of the documents were designated “confidential,” keeping them from public view.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The City Council swore in the most diverse group in its history Monday. The council made up more than half by women and people of color was ushered in by Mayor Martin Walsh during a ceremony at Faneuil Hall, the Boston Herald reports. The mayor swore in 13 members who included four new faces, which is an unusual amount of turnover for the council. Voters in November also elected the council’s first Latina member, Julian Mejia, as well as district councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Kenzie Bok and Liz Breadon, the first openly gay woman to serve on the council. City Councilor Kim Janey will also make history as the third woman of color to serve as the body’s president. The council was a white male bastion for decades, but Boston is now a “majority minority” city where whites comprise roughly 47% of the population.\n\nMichigan\n\nMidland: It’s not what the Egyptians had in mind, but it worked: A group of high school students made a pyramid out of toilet paper – 27,434 rolls. It took 16 hours for students to assemble the pyramid at Bullock Creek High School in Midland County. They are hoping to be recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records and sell the toilet paper as a fundraiser for the 20-member robotics team. “There was a lot of excitement when we got to the last few layers, but the final roll at the top was actually pretty anti-climactic,” Maxton Herst told MLive.com. “Every single roll you place, you want it to be in the correct spot. It was just kind of mind-numbing work.” Herst got the idea three years ago after seeing a similar pyramid on YouTube. The students built the pyramid during holiday break. Rolls of the two-ply toilet paper have since been placed into 96-count boxes for purchase.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWinona: An employee has been fired after tweeting criticism of his firm’s holiday gift to its workers. A branch manager for Fastenal in Canada was fired just before New Year’s Day after he posted a tweet chiding the company about its gift choice of barbecue sauce and a wooden grill scraper. Fastenal says the tweet violated the company’s policy on social media posts. CEO Dan Florness said the policy about acceptable standards of conduct is given to every employee and posted on the company website. News of the firing has been widely shared on social media and prompted a backlash, including several website posts and phone messages that were deleted immediately because they were “vulgar” or “threatening,” Florness told the Star Tribune. Fastena’l, based in Winona, says it’s the largest fastener distributor in North America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prisoner advocates are calling on the federal government to investigate the state’s prison system for possible civil rights violations, saying the violence of recent days highlights deliberate violations of inmates’ constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups said they were sending the letter Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Justice. The letter warns that “it is no exaggeration to say more lives will be lost absent immediate intervention.” U.S. Rep Bennie Thompson, Mississippi’s only Democrat in Congress, called Sunday for a federal investigation after inmates were killed by fellow prisoners across three prisons and an unknown number of inmates were injured in disturbances. Mississippi prison officials, who called in state troopers and a special team of prison guards from Tennessee to help regain control of the situation, have said four of the deaths are related to violence between gangs.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Gov. Mike Parson says he’s not convinced that unregulated and untaxed video gambling terminals in the state are illegal, even as investigators in his administration work to halt their spread. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Parson, the former Polk County sheriff, said he is monitoring a Platte County court case that could provide legal guidance to the state’s prosecutors on what constitutes a game of chance versus a game of skill. The video gambling terminals, which work in a fashion similar to slot machines, have been rolled out in truck stops, gas stations and convenience stores across the state. Opponents argue that slot machines are only allowed in casinos. But backers say the machines give players the option of viewing the outcome of a wager before placing a bet. The governor’s stance is in contrast to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, whose leaders have made a decision.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A Native American tribe has planned a celebration after recently gaining federal recognition. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana has announced plans to host a celebration Jan. 25 in Great Falls. The celebration comes about a month after President Donald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act containing an amendment giving the Little Shell Tribe federal recognition, officials said. The free celebration will be held at the Holiday Inn from 5 to 10 p.m. and is open to the public, tribal council members said. The celebration includes dinner, traditional music played by fiddlers, and speeches by dignitaries and council members. Other tribes are expected to be represented at the event, councilmembers said. The public is also invited to attend a pipe ceremony the same day at 1 p.m. at the Shawn Gilbert Event Center, tribal members said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The City Council is cracking down on illegal dumping at recycling collection sites. The council voted unanimously Monday to make it illegal to put recyclables anywhere but in the proper containers at the 19 collection sites available to residents. The new ordinance also bans dumping at the sites or in the recycling containers anything that can’t be recycled. People have left garbage and other objects at the sites, including hot tubs, tires, beds, televisions, wood pallets and pianos – all items that can’t be recycled. Cleaning up the resulting messes fell to the businesses hosting the sites, Lincoln transportation and utilities assistant director of utilities Donna Garden told the council last month. The ordinance also applies to recycling processing centers, salvage operations and commercial composting operations. Violators face fines of up to $500 for the misdemeanor offense.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An Australian mining company has agreed to a moratorium on new activities at a planned lithium mine in the state in exchange for conservationists dropping a lawsuit to protect a rare desert wildflower they say doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. The Center for Biological Diversity filed notice in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas that it was voluntarily withdrawing its lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking a ban on all drilling and road building at the site on federal land as a result of the newly reached agreement with Ioneer USA Corp. The center filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October to list Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species. The lawsuit filed weeks later accused the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations for any land disturbances larger than 5 acres.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Monks at a Catholic college faced off in court Monday against the school’s board of trustees in a dispute over an effort to limit the the monks’ power – a move some worry could lead to increased secularization. A judge heard motions in Hillsborough Superior Court related to a lawsuit filed against the Saint Anselm College board last year. The unusual clash was set in motion when the board moved to take away the monks’ ability to amend the school’s bylaws. Michael Tierney, representing the monks, said the school’s charter dictated that they retain the power to amend laws governing the school. The school was set up and run by Benedictine monks for 130 years. The board has argued that it has the authority under state law on nonprofit organizations to amend the bylaws. It argues the move is necessary to ensure it has the required independence for reaccreditation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state could see a significant increase in the number of electric cars traveling on local roads under a bill gaining momentum that would expand the state’s network of charging stations and give motorists a sizable rebate on a purchase or lease. The measure is seen as a cornerstone of efforts to reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, in a state that continually receives failing grades for smog. The bill was approved by two Assembly committees Monday as lawmakers push to pass it before the legislative session comes to a close next week. To achieve those clean air reductions, motorists will be given one of the best incentive packages in the nation to buy an electric car. At the center of the bill is a rebate of up to $5,000 intended to lower an electric vehicle’s sticker price to make the sector more competitive with gasoline-powered cars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature’s lead budget-writing committee on Tuesday recommended a 6.5% increase in state general fund spending and endorsed plans to stash away a portion of New Mexico’s windfall from oil production in trust funds to ensure future financial stability. The Legislative Finance Committee that operates a year-round policy and accountability office recommended a $464 million increase in sustained spending to about $7.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Another $325 million would be set aside in an investment trust to underwrite early childhood schooling and services, alongside smaller trusts dedicated to college affordability and rural libraries. Legislators expect the state will receive an $800 million surplus in general fund income next year, in excess of the $7 billion in current spending obligations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The country’s busiest train station would get new tracks, expanded terminals and better access for commuters under a plan announced by the governor Monday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will propose acquiring the block south of Penn Station to add at least eight new underground tracks, which he said will create new, larger terminals and boost track and train capacity by 40%. More than 600,000 people pass through Penn Station daily on trains run by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operator of the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City subway system. The station has 21 tracks and operates at full capacity during peak periods, leading to rippling delays when trains or infrastructure break down. The more than century-old station was considered an architectural masterpiece in its day, and its demolition and repurposing in the 1960s provoked a public outcry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A popular ferry route has closed for three months to allow crews to perform repairs. The StarNews reports the N.C. Department of Transportation closed the Southport-Fort Fisher ferry beginning Monday to update ramp equipment at both ferry terminals. The department’s ferry division said contractors expect work on the approximately $3 million project should be done by early April. The work comes after a failure of the ramp system on the Southport side of the ferry shut down the route for five weeks in August and September. The ferry closure will be a headache for tourists and commuters. What was a 30-minute trip over the water could take an hour-plus by road. Nearly 200,000 vehicles make the Southport-Fort Fisher crossing each year, the StarNews reports, citing state statistics.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A county commission that recently voted to limit how many refugees it would accept voted Monday not to put the issue before voters in a nonbinding straw poll. The Bismarck Tribune reports the five-member Burleigh County Commission voted 3-2 against a potential ballot question relating to future refugee resettlement. The vote breakdown was the same as the commission vote last month not to accept more than 25 refugees in 2020. That vote came after a four-hour meeting where several refugees, in often emotional testimony, urged the commission to continue accepting new arrivals. Had the commission voted a total ban on refugee resettlement in Burleigh County, home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck, refugee resettlement groups said they believe it would have been be the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump gave states and counties that power.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the state’s Medicaid official to look into what can be done in response to the recent increase in the number of children without health insurance. The governor’s directive came after a recent report showed Ohio’s uninsured rate for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is now the third-highest in the nation, with nearly 12,000 more children without coverage in 2018 than in 2016, the Columbus Dispatch reports. DeWine said he asked Medicaid Director Maureen Corcoran “to see what steps that we can take to deal with this” and to see if there is a way to “make re-enrollment easier” so that it is not a hurdle for those looking to get insured. The number of children without health insurance coverage climbed to 5% in 2018 from 3.6% in 2016, according to report released in December by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Two days of meetings and new searches are planned this week for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for more than two decades, authorities said Monday. Investigators with the Craig County District Attorney’s Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will be joined by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement for Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman in and around the former town of Picher, about 85 miles northeast of Tulsa, said district attorney spokeswoman Michelle Lowry. Lowry said a request from Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma late last year prompted the federal agency’s involvement. The OSMRE will use an underground camera and, if needed, lighting to examine the floors and walls of mine shafts in the area. Picher, which no longer exists as a town, was included in a federally funded buyout after a 2006 Army Corps of Engineers study revealed abandoned lead and zinc mines beneath the area had a high risk of caving in.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lagging snowfall early in the season could mean a tough, dry summer for farmers and ranchers around the state. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Resources Conservation Service says the amount of water from snow that’s fallen in Oregon right now is just 45% of normal statewide, the Capitol Press reports. Water from melting snow is crucial for replenishing streams and reservoirs for farms and fish, particularly in eastern Oregon where the climate is drier. Every water basin is measuring below average for snow except for the Owyhee Basin in southeastern Oregon, which stands at 117% of normal. The lowest totals are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins at 25% of normal and the Willamette Basin at 26%. The water year, as defined by hydrologists, begins Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30 of the following calendar year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday. A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices. The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer; Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks; and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland. Nesbit and Walsh were elected to become county judges, and DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner. Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nonprofits in the state have been awarded grants totaling nearly $300,000 for outreach to boost participation in the 2020 census. The Rhode Island Foundation announced the grants Monday from the Rhode Island Census 2020 Fund, a statewide, collaborative funding initiative. The goal is to protect the $3.8 billion a year Rhode Island receives in federal funding for education, health care, transportation and housing based on census data, the foundation said. Twenty-six organizations received funding for programs to reach hard-to-count communities, including the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education in Providence, Progreso Latino in Central Falls, and Meals on Wheels in Providence. Nonprofits, municipalities, houses of worship, and public agencies including libraries and schools can apply for grants in the second round of funding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Citadel is evaluating the college’s existing buildings, infrastructure and landscapes to create a long-term plan that will guide future building projects and campus renovations. The campus master plan will create a vision of what the public military college could look like 15 years from now, The Post and Courier reports. “Once we have a plan in place, it will guide all of our facility decisions going forward,” said Jeff Lamberson, vice president of facilities and engineering. The college finalized a $450,000 contract with Ayers Saint Gross, an architectural design firm spearheading the project, in October. College officials have talked with hundreds of students, faculty and staff in more than 35 focus-group meetings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislators have invited the Crow Creek Sioux tribal chairman to deliver the annual State of the Tribes address after some tribal leaders threatened to boycott a planned address by a member of Gov. Kristi Noem’s Cabinet. Lawmakers on Monday invited Lester Thompson Jr. to deliver the address next week. The move is a switch from plans to have Secretary of Tribal Relations Dave Flute give it. The annual speech is supposed to promote cooperation between the state government and the tribes but instead became a point of friction when tribal leaders objected to having a state employee give the speech. Last week, some tribal leaders said they would hold their own event called the Great Sioux Nation Tribal address. That event will still happen in Fort Pierre across the Missouri River from the Capitol but has been rescheduled for after the State of the Tribes address.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: One of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park’s most popular sites has been closed to all vehicles until repairs to a main access road tunnel are finished. The Cades Cove closure started Sunday night and is expected to last until March. Major repairs are needed for the internal drainage system in the 121-foot long Bote Mountain Tunnel on Laurel Creek Road, according to the National Park Service. The tunnel hasn’t undergone significant work since it was built in 1948. The cove’s campground also will be closed until March. The nearby Elkmont Campground and the Smokemont Campground in North Carolina will remain open year-round to accommodate displaced cove campers, according to WATE-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A contempt of court charge has been dropped against the Dallas County district attorney over a television interview he gave on the eve of a high-profile murder trial involving a police officer. Both sides filed a motion to drop the contempt charge against Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, who gave an interview before the start of former officer Amber Guyger’s murder trial despite a gag order by Judge Tammy Kemp. The white officer was convicted of murder for the shooting death of her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his own apartment. Kemp said in an order that the interview, in which Creuzot explained why he thought Guyger was correctly charged with murder rather than manslaughter, was a “direct violation” of the gag order she’d issued in the case.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Department of Transportation has started making safety improvements near a homeless resource center where cars killed three men, officials said. The department has installed electronic message signs to urge drivers to be cautious and alert for pedestrians near the South Salt Lake center, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake City leaders called for immediate pedestrian safety improvements after three men were fatally struck while trying to cross the street near the center. Police believe all three men were homeless and seeking shelter at the center. Four crashes, including those involving the fatalities, have occurred in the area since the November opening of the 300-bed men’s resource center, police said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bakery is hosting a raffle to find the lucky person who gets to tear down a gingerbread village. In a first for Birchgrove Baking, the sweet treat establishment is selling customers tickets “for the chance to win the right to destroy the village.” Initially, after the holiday season was over, the bakery struggled to find a creative way to raze its gingerbread village. Birchgrove co-owner John Belding says the owners have in the past resorted to destroying it themselves, getting out their own tension from the hectic year. Sales from this year’s raffle will go toward the Central Vermont Humane Society, an ongoing collaborator with Birchgrove Baking. Winners will be announced Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More people earned bachelor’s degrees in the state last year than ever before. Data from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia shows that a record number of degrees were awarded in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health fields. During the 2018-19 school year, public and private nonprofit colleges and universities awarded 122,168 degrees and certificates – an increase of nearly 50% from a decade ago. In-state students accounted for 86,325, or more than 70%, of those awards. Bachelor’s degrees accounted for 46% of the total, while graduate degrees made up 25%. Associate degrees made up 16%, and certificates made up 13%. The three most popular bachelor’s degree programs remained unchanged from previous years: business administration and management; psychology; and biology/biological sciences. Those three majors accounted for 19% of all bachelor’s degrees.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court on Monday swore in a new chief justice, as well as its first-ever Native American justice. The Spokesman-Review reports Justice Debra Stephens became the court’s 57th chief justice. A former Appeals Court judge and adjunct professor of law at Gonzaga University, she called it “the greatest privilege I can imagine.” Raquel Montoya-Lewis, a former Whatcom County Superior Court judge who is a member of the Pueblo Iselta tribe of New Mexico, was sworn in at the same ceremony. Montoya-Lewis is the first Native American to serve on Washington’s highest court and only the second to serve on any state supreme court in the nation. Stephens called it a historic day. Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday was a day when “a daughter of Spokane ascends to chief justice,” and the court gets Lewis-Montoya, a “judicial superstar” who is a good listener, decisive, caring and compassionate.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Department of Natural Resources says anglers should expect trout stocked in state waterways during the winter months to be smaller than usual. A long dry spell across the state from late summer through fall is thought to have affected the average “catchable” size of the fish, Jim Hedrick, the division’s hatchery supervisor, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. When the drought broke in October, the hatcheries’ water supplies were replenished and allowed workers to begin feeding trout at the normal rate. But winter weather soon slowed the growth rate again, Hedrick said. The growth rate is expected to return to normal as the weather gets warmer, he said. The division is also adding feed to try to increase trout size. Hedrick said each of the 31 streams and 30 lakes designated for January stockings will receive as many pounds of fish as last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans decided Tuesday to place only President Donald Trump’s name on the state’s primary ballot this spring, setting up obstacles for any long-shot candidates to challenge him in the state. A committee made up of Republicans and Democrats met with state election officials in the Capitol to decide which candidates will be placed on the April 7 primary ballot. The Republican committee members submitted only Trump’s name; he was approved on a unanimous voice vote. The Democratic committee members submitted 14 candidates. The Republican move will make it more difficult but not impossible for other GOP hopefuls such as former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh to get on the GOP primary ballot. They could still be included if they each collect 8,000 signatures by Jan. 28.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A school district has paid off more than $4,000 in student lunch debt after a crowd-sourced check bounced. The Casper Police Department has opened an investigation into the “Feed Casper Students” fundraising campaign on GoFundMe aimed at paying off the Natrona County School District’s student lunch debt, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The district accepted about $19,000 in fundraising donations in April, the same month the check bounced, school officials said. The district paid off the lunch debt for about 250 students out of its general fund, rather than reopen the outstanding debt for the students, officials said. A school district administrator made several attempts to reach the woman who started the fundraiser, Brittny French, authorities said. Multiple attempts by the Star-Tribune to contact French were unsuccessful last week, including through GoFundMe. Police asked anyone who had donated to the campaign to get in touch with police.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/03/10/letters-to-the-editor-for-sunday-march-10-2024/72851669007/", "title": "Letters to the editor for Sunday, March 10, 2024", "text": "Letter writers\n\nGannett\n\nLetters to the editor should be 250 words or less.

Consider the digital divide, for starters. A recent client reached out for help because she does not have a smartphone. She is unable to register in her doctor’s portal. She cannot pay her bills online. She struggles to connect with a person when she calls for help. Which is why this 91-year-old woman called the Collier Resource Center (CRC), where actual case managers do answer phone calls!\n\nNavigating the maze of available health and human services across the county can be especially daunting for our older population. So many senior-serving agencies offer so much; we are more effective when we collaborate for the sake of our seniors in need.\n\nThis month CRC hired a community-based Interagency Senior Services Liaison, thanks to support from the Collier Community Foundation. Rose Labarge is fully prepared to enhance collaboration between agencies to solve problems more effectively and better serve our seniors, no matter their income level, no matter their need.\n\nWe know that the quality of life for our seniors will be significantly enhanced with someone dedicated to identifying gaps in senior services and collaborating with other agencies to fill them. If you are a senior in need, do not hesitate to call the Collier Resource Center at (239) 434-2030. We look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKari Lefort, CEO, Collier Resource Center, Naples\n\nDrainage ditches for Lake O\n\nIt doesn’t take a biologist or hydrologist to see the change in water color from brown to blue as you travel the shore from Fort Myers to Naples. This is because the farther you get from the Caloosahatchee River the cleaner the ocean is. The Caloosahatchee (and the St. Lucie River to the east) are the drainage ditches for the South Florida cesspool, Lake Okeechobee. When we have high rains that require excessive releases from Lake O, we experience high fish mortality and toxic algae, as we did a few years ago when thousands of pounds of dead fish washed up on our shore daily.\n\nThe solution − we are now building a bigger cesspool − excavating the south shore of Lake O to increase our holding capacity. Don’t expect anything to change until Big Ag (sugar, citrus & beef) are required to adopt better practices.\n\nThis won’t occur until either 1) a much broader legislative understanding occurs way beyond our local representatives or 2) The Supreme Court overturns it’s Citizens United decision, which allows corporations to contribute unlimited amounts to PACs and campaigns. #2 is unlikely, so spread the word to your friends throughout Florida.\n\nGary Fields, Fort Myers Beach\n\nSave Jaycee Park\n\nI was at Jaycee Park Sunday, March 3, and saw with joy and satisfaction that the park was full of people at 10 a.m. All the parking places were taken. The city plans to install a Bar/Bistro in the park where most of the people were walking and enjoying the river view. Where will these people park when the bar is open? Where will people who do not live on a canal or by the river come to relax with the only river view they have? There is an unsolicited bid to pay for city planned commercialization of the park, and a public records request to find out the identity of the bidder has been rebuffed by the city. Bids were closed January 26. The expensive plans for this park are at 30% completion and the public was promised a public input meeting at this percentage as stated in the city's Question and Answer handout of 8/31/23. We await a date and location. Please sign a petition to keep the park as is or sign the Referendum to Save the Park on the November ballot by coming to Jaycee Park any Saturday, 10:30 to noon, by the north shelter to pick up petitions.\n\nSally Flash, Cape Coral\n\nFort Myers tunnel vision\n\nThe current city administration in Fort Myers is on a power trip that almost seems to be a war on the local residents and small businesses. From making the limited free parking downtown paid, which directly and negatively impacted small businesses, to now removing free parking along W First Street and adjacent side streets. Yet pedestrians aren’t safe on sidewalks or crossing the streets due to the failure to provide meaningful traffic enforcement where it’s really needed, in regards to speed limits, stop sign and stoplight enforcement, and golf carts and ebikes running those same pedestrians off the sidewalks.It's obvious to this resident that the city administration is demonstrating a degree of narrow-mindedness or tunnel vision with regards to the needs of the populace of this city. While the Municipal Yacht Basin molders, becoming more and more of an embarrassment by the day, the city is pouring resources into stealing available parking from the same small business owners and residents that provide the tax base that pays their salaries.I, for one, believe that the current city administration is out of control and should be reined in. They were not elected to turn the city into a ghost town, or punish the residents who live, work, spend year-round. Their actions with regards to the changes in parking regulations, while ignoring real issues, to me demonstrates that there is more going on here – Follow the money, where is the parking revenue going? Clearly not into anything benefitting the residents of Fort Myers.\n\nRobert Waldrop, Fort Myers\n\nReject Marco Island proposal\n\nIn 2010, after a year long effort involving significant public and political input, a Marco Island Charter Revision commission put forward a number of proposed revisions to our City Charter. Residents voted on these proposals during a general election, the preferred process under state law. One of the changes, with approval by 76% of voters, created our current City Council term limits. Another proposal tried to increase City Council salaries with a cumulative 13 year inflation adjustment from 1997, and then added automatic annual COLA increases going forward. It was soundly rejected by over 86% of voters.\n\nDespite the clear message from the 2010 vote, our City Council for unknown reasons recently dusted off that old rejected pay proposal and expanded the inflation adjustment to now cover the 26 years since 1997. If approved, the new base salary will be almost doubled for these less than part-time positions and will increase every year going forward. There was no Charter Revision commission this time around, nor any public input or proper vetting and analysis. And rather than allowing us to vote on this proposal in a general election, when voter interest and turnout is at its highest, it is embedded in the upcoming and now unnecessary Republican presidential preference primary, where voter turnout will be extremely low.This proposal as structured should be rejected. Instead, the next City Council should create a new Charter Revision committee to look at all potentially needed updates to our city charter.\n\nJohn Conroy, Marco Island\n\nUnpopular education policies\n\nThe Republican-dominated Florida Legislature is determined future generations of children will learn at school that the Civil War was not really about slavery; they’ll learn that slaves were not mistreated; they learned trades and were actually paid for their work on some occasions. The history curriculum will establish the idea that ours has never been a racist country. Lynchings and events such as the Tulsa massacre were isolated incidents in no way indicative of racial bias throughout the country. The Civil Rights Movement was not about racial injustice, MLK and other Black leaders were simply exhorting their people to be better citizens.\n\nThe Legislature couldn’t have gotten away with this outrageous rewriting of history until recently. But they have carefully laid the groundwork for this effort by relentlessly attacking the credibility of public-school educators. In their view, teachers are “indoctrinators” who teach our children lies, make them uncomfortable with the history of their country and even encourage them to question their sexual identity. Since teachers can’t be trusted to teach the truth, politicians will have to write the curriculum, and parents can step up and get books banned they consider “pornographic” or deal with LGBT+ themes.\n\nA recent survey maintains that 90% of adult Floridians want public school curriculum created by educational professionals, “not elected officials looking to push unpopular policies that censor classroom discussion on race, gender identity and expression.” Unfortunately, our state Legislature doesn’t care what the majority of Floridians want.\n\nRay Clasen, North Fort Myers\n\nColorado and the Court\n\nThe current U.S. Supreme Court argued that Colorado did not have the right to enforce the Constitution.\n\nOf course it does.\n\nHarold A Maio, Fort Myers\n\nSupreme Court plays politics\n\nThe Colorado Supreme Court, in Trump v. Anderson, upheld Donald Trump’s disqualification under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that: “Because the Constitution makes Congress, rather than the States, responsible for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates, we reverse.”\n\nSection 3 does not call for Congress to enforce disqualification for participating or aiding in an insurrection. It merely gives Congress the power to remove that disqualification by a two-thirds majority of each house. To hold that the “States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency” is agreeing that the states have no power to uphold the Constitution. The Court refused to recognize that the constitutional disqualification of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is self-executing.Nine justices wrongly concluded that upholding the Colorado decision would allow each state to go their own way. Upholding the 14th Amendment disqualification in the Colorado case would have meant Trump’s removal from the presidential ballots of all states.The conservative justices recognized that the findings by the Colorado trial court could not be overturned because there was no error in reaching them. Those findings would have had national impact. Trump would be nationally disqualified. Then Congress could remove that disqualification with a two-thirds majority of each house.Bottom line: Our current Supreme Court has rewritten the Constitution without consulting “we the people.”\n\nJoe Haack, Naples\n\nBiden and student loans\n\nWhat a crying shame! Claiming schools mislead borrowers is a joke. How smart can these students be to fall for such lame excuses? Plain and simple, it‘s another Biden ploy to buy votes! Cancer patients could claim similar promises and their medical bills remain.\n\nDick Jones, Naples and Ocean City, NJ\n\nIn service of Trump\n\nI guess the GOP members in the USA Congress forgot that citizens elected them and not Donald Trump. Hopefully one of these days they will wake up.\n\nHerb Taylor, Fort Myers\n\nHamas started conflict\n\nI must admit I am having trouble understanding the free Palestine movement. I do feel for the carnage and famine. However I believe many forgot how this all began.\n\nOn a peaceful morning Hamas the governing force of Palestine came in and slaughtered. Tortured. Raped. Killed and took hostages. Israel attacked back. Should they not have?\n\nWhen Japan bombed Pearl Harbor we attacked back and killed and maimed many of their citizens.\n\nRussia is invading and destroying innocents in Ukraine. I do not see the same pushback there.\n\nI am a humanitarian. I hate war. I hate innocents being collateral damage.\n\nThe Hamas soldiers seem to have enough resources for food and arms. Could they help end this war by returning the innocent hostages and putting down their weapons. Could they not help their own citizens with food and water. Instead of using them as human shields.\n\nI think we need to remember how this began. And who really has the power to end it.\n\nJeri Heap, Fort Myers\n\nTrump proposals ironic\n\nHow ironic that former President Trump is beating the drum for America’s NATO allies to pay their fair share, not a bad idea, or the United States will abandon them, and that foreign aid should be converted to loan packages to be repaid by the recipient countries, not a bad idea, either.\n\nIn his pre-presidential business career he stiffed innumerable vendors, suppliers, workers, and others; ran up huge debts; and had his companies file bankruptcies at least five times, along with many other failed enterprises from an airline to steaks.\n\nNow, he’s facing more than $500 million in judgments in the defamation and business fraud cases in New York with bleak prospects of satisfying those debts.\n\nIf he were to be elected again and his NATO proposals materialize, it’s hoped that he’s a better creditor than he has been as a debtor.\n\nMarshall H. Tanick, Naples\n\nReject Trump\n\nIf there is truth in the statement you are known by the company you keep we know who Trump admires. Dictators like Putin, Xi and Kim Jong Un. Can we doubt if he becomes president he will try to emulate these people he admires?Do we want to forfeit all the hard work and sacrifice of our ancestors for this megalomaniac? Don’t believe him when he says only on day one. If he invokes the insurrection act on day one it would continue long beyond day one. People who love this country should reject him totally.\n\nBenjamin Glick, Naples\n\nScience over religious doctrine\n\nThe Founding Fathers created the Constitution to safeguard the Great Experiment from repeating the errors of European theocratic policies and practices. Separation of Church and State is the guardrail whereby well-meaning (and other motivated) religious zealots could not impose their particular theological views upon the public citizenry. Constitutional authors were not opposed to religion per se but they were deeply concerned about religious authority replacing freedom from religion. Unfortunately, recent court decisions, e.g., reversal of Roe, Alabama's ban of in vitro fertilization (IVF), pose serious threats to said separation.\n\nI would argue that those cherished ideals embedded in the Constitution (justice, liberty, freedom) are far more aligned with Christ's teachings than the angry, oft-cited hateful rhetoric of \"Christian\" Nationalists seeking to impose their wrongheaded interpretations of selected biblical phrases upon the nation. When elected or appointed government officials inject themselves in peoples' personal lives, i.e., reproductive decision-making, based solely upon theological beliefs, the republic has entered the political quagmire that had flummoxed our European neighbors for centuries (Copernicus' heliocentric theory, Catholic-Protestant wars).\n\nIn my opinion, science offers the better approach in addressing complex social issues with biological, chemical and/or environmental ramifications. Do scientists always get it right? No, but when new data presents itself that refutes earlier research/policy, the scientific community is far quicker to admit its error than other institutions and publicly share those findings. Research science aims to refute existing theory more so than merely confirm it − a practice that is often eschewed by many in the nonsecular and political realms.\n\nIn recent years, many of our Republican leaders have banned face coverings and derided the efficacy of vaccinations as deterrents to the spread of infectious disease. Today these same folks are banning IVF. If this trend continues, birth control measures (prophylactics, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, vasectomies, tubal ligation) will be deemed illegal in Republican-dominated states (and if the Trump-dominated SCOTUS weighs in). But why stop with the eradication of reproductive rights? Is the next step, removal of all dams, levees and seawalls that restrict the natural waterways? Do not lightning rods divert the natural flow of lightning strikes? Will spaying and neutering of animals be the (il)logical next step?\n\nFar right legislators have created a slippery slope by rushing into medical health fields that they are ill equipped to address without the guidance of science. Congressional briefings are the very mechanism whereby experts share their information with statesmen/women affording the latter the opportunity to make informed decisions. Unfortunately, too many Republican seats are filled with ideologues unmoved by data challenging their entrenched doctrine. Hopefully, the November election will replace ideologues with members committed to justice, liberty and freedom.\n\nJames L. DeBoy, Fort Myers\n\nDon't enable Trump\n\nHave you MAGAs considered what a Trump presidency will be like? I hope you care because he is openly telling you his plans, which are not to benefit the country, but only himself when he becomes a dictator.\n\nWhy do you think he never spoke at the Republican debates? Because he has no plans for America, only for himself. All of you foolishly supporting his legal costs, and buying gold sneakers, will be forgotten as soon as you pay.\n\nYou don’t seem to understand the deplorable conditions he will institute here. As dictator he will cancel the Constitution. He will condemn all news agencies, the CIA, the FBI, all medical programs (he’s already started this with the abortion dictates and personal frozen embryos). Anything we enjoy in our freedoms now will be removed. Environmentally he will remove all that protects the planet. He will drill for oil and encourage global warming. Anything that doesn’t show a benefit for Trump. He will have spies to report if you're not showing enough honor for him. Just like Hitler!\n\nMy father fought Nazi Germany in WWII. He was in the British Army. People were thrown out of their homes with 20 minutes to grab what they could, then shipped to concentration camps. Dad released Bergen Belsen camp where hundreds starved, and those still alive were “walking skeletons.” Is this what you want in a Trump dictatorship?\n\nTrump has had his way his whole life, lying and cheating like a spoiled brat with no accountability. Don’t let him succeed with this madness.\n\nPam Cannon, Naples\n\nIsrael-U.S. ties run deep\n\nThe friendship between the United States of America and the State of Israel runs deep.Americans know many of our modern medical and technical innovations have their origins in Israel’s universities and startups.Faith based Holyland tours, historical and archaeological study and joint business ventures bring Americans to Israel in droves!In addition to soccer, Israelis playing baseball, softball, football, even ice hockey to tennis grows year after year.

Trustees of the historically Black school in east Alabama elected Morris to the position, which takes effect Sunday, officials said in a statement. Morris’ time as interim president began with the departure of Lily McNair, who began in 2018 and and left earlier this year. With more than 30 years at the school, Morris’ previous roles at Tuskegee included chief of staff and secretary to the board. Her inauguration as the school’s ninth president is planned for April to coincide with Founder’s Day. “She understands the needs of this university today – putting the students first – and is the right leader for tomorrow and beyond,” board chair Norma Clayton said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A small airplane reported overdue Monday was found crashed, with the two people on board dead, according to Alaska State Troopers. Austin McDaniel, a troopers spokesperson, said there were two adults on board. He said the plane left from Anchorage, but he did not have immediate details on the purpose of the flight or when it took off. He said by email that the wreckage was found in Chugach State Park. The troopers, in an online log, said authorities were notified about 8 p.m. Monday of an overdue aircraft that had taken off from an Anchorage airport. The statement said the aircraft was believed to have gone up the Knik River Valley toward Knik Glacier and Lake George before heading toward Chugach State Park. A good Samaritan found the wreckage about 10:45 p.m. Monday and was able to land nearby. Recovery efforts were expected to start Tuesday, the troopers’ statement said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A dust cloud that triggered a dust advisory in Maricopa, Casa Grande and Florence on Tuesday night moved north along Interstate 10 to hit the southern edge of Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix issued a dust advisory affecting parts of Maricopa County, including the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert and Queen Creek until 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. Visibility was below 1 mile in some areas, including parts of I-10, Interstate 8, highway 347, and Highway 85 south of Gila Bend, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Just before 7:30 p.m., the weather service said the dust cloud was blowing into the Phoenix area and would cause visibility to drop to 1 to 3 miles, “enough to notice but not low enough to cause significant concerns.” At 7:45 p.m., the weather service said isolated storms across central Arizona would wind down in the next hour or two although dust clouds, heavy rain and gusty winds were possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The leader of the University of Arkansas system proposed keeping a statue of the late U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus but add “contextualization” about his legacy, despite calls to remove the monument because of Fulbright’s support of segregation. System President Donald Bobbitt cited a new state law preventing the removal of historical monuments without state approval in his proposal, which was scheduled to go before the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday. Bobbitt’s proposal also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’ college of arts and sciences. The proposal called for adding “a contextualization to the statue that affirms the university’s commitment to racial equality and acknowledges Senator Fulbright’s complex legacy, including his record on international affairs, civil rights legislation, and racial integration.” Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known worldwide for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The San Francisco school board violated state law when it voted to cover up a 1930s mural that critics said is racist and degrading in its depiction of Black and Native American people, a judge ruled Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo said the board failed to conduct an environmental impact review before it voted in 2019 to cover up the sprawling mural at George Washington High School that depicts the life of George Washington, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The 1936 mural was painted by Victor Arnautoff, one of the foremost muralists in the San Francisco area during the Depression. In addition to depicting Washington as a soldier, surveyor and statesman, the 13-panel, 1,600-square-foot mural contains images of white pioneers standing over the body of a Native American and slaves working at Washington’s Mount Vernon estate in Virginia. New Deal scholars have argued that Arnautoff, a Russian-born communist and social critic, critically depicts unsavory aspects of American history in his work. But as early as the 1960s, some students at George Washington High School have argued that the mural’s imagery is offensive and racist. District officials told the Chronicle that they were reviewing the decision. Members can’t take any further action until at least September.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A U.S. appeals court has ruled against a web designer who didn’t want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples and sued to challenge Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver denied Lorie Smith’s attempt to overturn a lower court ruling throwing out her legal challenge. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith, argued that the law forced her to violate her Christian beliefs. In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said Colorado had a compelling interest in protecting the “dignity interests” of members of marginalized groups through its law. The anti-discrimination law is the same one at issue in the case of Colorado baker Jack Phillips that was decided in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court decided the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people. The Alliance Defending Freedom said it would appeal the ruling. “The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is embarking on a plan to dedicate Medicaid funds to help address the problem of gun violence and other violent crimes. Under new legislation, financially challenged community-based violence prevention services will be able to receive state and federal Medicaid funds. These programs, which are growing across the U.S., typically involve intervention at the hospital after someone has been shot and intensive case management in the months following the injury to try and break the cycle of violence .Connecticut’s new law requires the state Department of Social Services commissioner by July 1, 2022, to amend the state’s Medicaid plan so it will cover the cost of community violence prevention services for beneficiaries who have received medical treatment for an injury “sustained from an act of community violence,” such as a shooting, and have been referred for services by a licensed health care or social services provider.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro:The Mountaire Farms chicken processing plant has been issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control after a contractor digging a ditch for a new pipeline damaged an existing one, causing treated wastewater to spill into Swan Creek. Ironically, the digging was taking place as part of construction of the poultry plant’s new wastewater treatment system, according to the notice. When the pipe broke, the treated effluent filled up the excavated area and ultimately made its way into the new, unfinished pipeline that discharges into Swan Creek. The incident occurred April 24 and Mountaire reported it to DNREC that day, the notice said. An estimated 15,000 gallons of effluent flowed into Swan Creek for about 10 minutes before the source was shut off. DNREC issued the notice of violation to Mountaire on June 15, charging them with unauthorized discharge to surface water. The only action required of Mountaire is that it provide DNREC with documentation of repairs. No fines were levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents of the 600 block of Irving Street Northwest said D.C.’s urban foresters missed obvious signs that an aging oak tree on the street was ready to topple, WUSA-TV reported. “It was a ticking time bomb,” said Tommy Duren, whose home was badly damaged when the tree came down during storms Monday night. “I don’t know how an arborist gets this wrong.” Two other homes were damaged in the incident. Duren said pruning crews and inspectors should have known the tree was a threat. A spokesman for D.C.’s Department of Transportation, which oversees the Urban Forestry Division, said the last time the tree had been pruned by a city crew was in January. The spokesman described the situation as “force majeure”, a legal term meaning an unforeseeable circumstance. The Urban Forestry Division is responsible for more than 175,000 public trees in the district, according to the agency’s website, which reported the city removed nearly 2,700 trees in the last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Gov. Ron DeSantis held a private meeting Monday with doctors to oppose mask mandates in public schools. DeSantis said he fears that the federal government might try to force mask mandates in schools, saying children would suffer. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status. “Our view is that this should absolutely not be imposed. It should not be mandated. And I know our Legislature feels strongly about it,” said DeSantis. He predicted lawmakers would hold a special session “to be able to provide protections for parents and kids who just want to breathe freely and don’t want to be suffering under these masks during the school year.” DeSantis didn’t invite media to the discussion, but his office provided a video and transcript of the meeting in the state Capitol. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new coronavirus infections last week, more than any other state, according to the CDC. But DeSantis has been firmly opposed to lockdown restrictions, mask mandates and vaccine passports, signing a bill into law that prevents businesses to ask for proof of vaccination and local governments from imposing COVID restrictions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Delta Air Lines is loosening restrictions on basic economy tickets to reduce the deluge of frustrated travelers facing hourslong waits on customer service phone lines. Basic economy tickets usually do not allow any changes to the itinerary, even for a change fee. The airline temporarily allowed more flexibility during the pandemic, but that policy ended earlier this year. Starting Wednesday, however, Delta will temporarily allow changes to basic economy tickets for travel through Dec. 31, 2021, “to help address call wait times as we increase staffing,” CEO Ed Bastian wrote in an update to customers. The changes can be made online without paying a change fee. Delta cut about 18,000 of its 90,000 employees last year through buyouts and early retirements to cut costs amid the pandemic, leaving it short-staffed when travelers rapidly returned to the skies. “The unexpected pace of the return of our customers has resulted in some unforeseen challenges as we ramp up to meet demand and handle a record-breaking level of calls,” Bastian told customers Tuesday. He acknowledged that “the last thing you want is to experience long hold times when you call reservations or receive a notification that your flight schedule has changed.” To alleviate the problem, the Atlanta-based airline also is hiring more than 5,000 people, including 1,300 reservations specialists who will be trained by September and 3,000 in airport customer service and other areas. Delta has hired more than 2,200 people in Georgia this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s Department of Health has updated its guidance to schools a week before the start of another school year during the pandemic. The department’s guidance includes recommendations for wearing masks in all indoor settings and maintaining at least 3 feet of physical distance between students in classrooms, when possible. Masks are recommended outdoors when there’s crowding or prolonged close contact, said acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble. The department said schools should consider screening testing for all teachers and staff who have not been fully vaccinated regardless of the level of community transmission. The guidance also includes screening testing for those who are not fully vaccinated to facilitate participation in sports and other activities with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Promoting vaccines against COVID-19 for all eligible children and adults is the top strategy for safe in-person learning, Kemble said. Hawaii’s public school students return to classes Aug. 3.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: About 89% of Idaho residents live in communities where officials said masks should be worn again. The Post Register reported Wednesday that 27 of Idaho’s 44 counties have substantial to high transmission of COVID-19. Central District Health also said it supports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated recommendation for masks. Central District Health oversees Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties. The city of Boise on Wednesday started requiring masks indoors at its city-owned facilities. In a statement, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said they were concerned about rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Idaho has the sixth-lowest vaccination rate, with only about 46% of all eligible residents being fully vaccinated, compared to 56% of all eligible Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Michigan-based cannabis company on Tuesday ended its challenge of Illinois’ plan to authorize new marijuana business. Sozo Illinois Inc.’s decision to drop its lawsuit will allow Illinois to proceed with awarding licenses to operate marijuana dispensaries. The state on Thursday is to hold the first of three lotteries to award 55 licenses to applicants that scored 85% or better on their applications for recreational cannabis stores. The licenses have been delayed for more than a year, initially because of COVID-19-related issues. Problems with scoring the applications added to the delay. Sozo Illinois Inc. claimed Illinois law unfairly lowered its chances of getting a license. The lawsuit noted part of the law gives bonus points in scoring applications from Illinois-based companies, and another removed a bonus for hiring 10 people from areas hurt by the war on drugs. The lawsuit sought a court order to stop the lotteries. The Chicago Tribune reported Gov. J.B. Pritzker spokeswoman Charity Greene responded to Sozo Illinois’ actions with a statement saying it has a priority of his administration to establish a legal cannabis industry in Illinois that is equitable and reflects the diversity of the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:Elementary students in South Bend will be required to wear masks when the school year begins next month under the district’s new coronavirus response plan. The plan approved Monday night by the South Bend Community School Corp. board outlines the coronavirus measures that will be in place when the school year begins for students Aug. 11. Students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade will be required to wear masks indoors, but face coverings will not be required but strongly encouraged among unvaccinated staff and middle and high school students, the South Bend Tribune reported. Staff and middle- and high-school students who are vaccinated can go mask-free, but all visitors to any district school building will be required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status. Administrators said their decision comes in consultation with health officials and follows similar moves in large school districts, such as Indianapolis Public Schools and Wayne Township, in Indianapolis’ west suburbs. Unlike Indianapolis, which will collect voluntary proof of vaccination for those opting not to wear masks, South Bend’s policy will largely be based on an honor system.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected new federal government recommendations about wearing masks to help slow the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant in the U.S.. Reynolds signed a law in May that prohibits local officials from requiring masks to be worn in schools or businesses. Iowa ranks 21st in the nation when it comes to vaccinations, with 49.4% of the population, or 1.56 million people, fully vaccinated. Like many states, vaccination interest has stagnated in recent weeks. Iowa’s seven-day moving average of daily cases was 241 on Monday, the highest level since May 14.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A central Kansas school district is requiring masks in its buildings, and public health officials in one of the state’s most populous counties are recommending that nearly every resident wear masks in indoor public spaces. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature ended Kansas’ state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic in mid-June, citing a decline in new cases. The Salina district’s board of education voted 5-2 during a special Tuesday night meeting to impose its mask requirement, the Salina Journal reported. The district, which has about 6,900 students, appears to be the first outside the Kansas City area to impose a new mask mandate. It joined the Kansas City, Kansas, district and the neighboring Shawnee Mission district in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, to require at least some students to wear masks. Meanwhile, the Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health department on Tuesday began recommending that anyone age 2 or older wear masks in schools and other indoor spaces, even though the county has among the highest vaccination rates and the lowest total number of COVID-19 cases per capita among the state’s 105 counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nGeorgetown: A public workshop is planned to discuss options for an aging dam on the north fork of Elkhorn Creek, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said. The agency said it will lead a discussion on Aug. 3 about the Great Crossing Dam near Georgetown. A study commissioned by Scott County officials found the low-head dam needs repair but isn’t in danger of immediate failure. Fish and Wildlife said it is considering options that include removing the structure from the waterway, which would improve safety for boaters and swimmers and also improve water quality. The meeting will be held at Great Crossing High School in Georgetown. Those attending will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to department officials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As COID-19 vaccine interest plummeted in Louisiana, the state saw a spike in the number of wasted shots, with more than 79,000 doses trashed largely because health providers couldn’t find enough arms quickly enough. Wasted doses of the vaccines numbered fewer than 1,500 only four months ago. But data provided to the Associated Press by the Louisiana Department of Health showed the unused, discarded shots surged to more than 50 times that number by July 23. Meanwhile, another 161,000 doses of the three COVID-19 vaccines available across the state are scheduled to expire within 14 days – a waste the Health Department hopes to avoid either through a possible federal decision to extend the expiration dates or through increased vaccine interest. Waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, and the doses trashed in Louisiana so far represent less than 1% of the nearly 3.5 million vaccines that reached arms. Louisiana already is only drawing down a sliver of the vaccine doses made available by the federal government each week, despite an all-out push to get people interested in the shots that includes offering $2.3 million in cash prizes and scholarships.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Boothbay: A Maine marine science lab has received $5 million to further research into whether seaweed-based food can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cows. Bigelow Laboratory has been working in recent years on whether the feed supplements can help cut emissions of methane at cattle operations. Methane emissions, which happen when cows belch, allegedly contribute to climate change. The laboratory said the grant is from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and it will build on a project that began in 2019. Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory and the project leader, said the funding will help scientists apply their work in a way that is feasible on a global scale. The lab said it has had success in feed trials with individual herds. One of the biggest questions is how the supplement can be produced in large enough quantities and at a reasonable enough cost to make a dent in worldwide farming operations. Price said new parts of the project will “complement our existing search for the right seaweed solution and enable us to look into some creative ways that we can use what we’re learning to actually solve this global problem.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:The Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating three incidents of houses being set on fire on Nokomis Avenue in Salisbury. The first broke out on July 21. A social media post from the Salisbury Fire Department showed crews responded to the blaze just before 6 a.m. and were able to extinguish the fire and clear the scene before 7:30 a.m. Two other fires were reported simultaneously on July 23, just before 10 p.m., according to a news release from the fire marshal’s office. The homes are owned by Milford Twilley Rentals, the fire marshal’s office said, and were left with moderate fire, heat and smoke damage. There were no injuries, but the fire marshal’s office estimated the blazes totaled about $110,000 in damages. Smoke alarms were present for two of the fires but did not activate because the fires were set outside at the back of the homes. The fire marshal’s office said neighbors noticed all three blazes and reported them to the fire department. No arrests have been made. Deputy state fire marshals are asking anyone with information to call (410) 713-3780. Callers can remain anonymous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An Army officer from Massachusetts who was reported missing in action during the Korean War has been accounted for and is coming home for burial, military officials said. The remains of 1st Lt. Thomas J. Redgate, are scheduled to buried at the veterans’ cemetery in Bourne on Sept. 17, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a statement. Redgate, a member of Battery A, 48th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division, was reported missing Dec. 11, 1950, when his unit was attacked during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, according to the Army. The exact details surrounding his loss were not known, and his remains could not be recovered at the time. He was 24. In July 2018, following a summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea turned over 55 boxes that purportedly contained the remains of American service members killed during the war. The remains were examined at the DPAA’s laboratory in Hawaii, and based on anthropological analysis, as well as DNA and circumstantial evidence, one set was determined to be Redgate’s. Redgate, whose hometown was listed as Boston’s Brighton neighborhood, was accounted for in April 2020, but the announcement was made Wednesday because his family only recently received a full briefing of his identification, the Army said. Redgate’s name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarysville:City leaders have enacted a new law banning chickens, pheasants, badgers, kangaroos, coyotes and even cougars and tigers, the Times Herald of Port Huron reported. The new domestic animals and fowl ordinance that goes into effect in mid-August was crafted after some residents complained about neighbors who owned chickens and crowing roosters, according to Marysville City Manager Randy Fernandez. Marysville’s current ordinance bans “animals or domestic fowl within the city except dogs, cats, birds, fowl, or animals commonly classified as pets,” the newspaper reported. “So, what this basically does is tighten the limit on … no more chickens and some other animals that we would consider livestock, that do not belong in the limits of Marysville or any other city,” Fernandez told city council members Monday. Marysville has about 9,600 residents and is located along the St. Clair River, which separates that part of Michigan from Canada. The new ordinance allows Fernandez to deal with addressing future animal complaints “case-by-case if that’s the way that administration wants to,” City Attorney Al Francis said. However, the inclusion of animals such as chinchillas, doves and ferrets on the banned list might have been a little too much, according to Councilman Dave Barber, who said he knows people who keep such animals. “I get the rest of it, and I feel for the folks who have chickens,” Barber said. “But I question those three.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials said they are investigating a COVID-19 outbreak at a camp for teenagers in the northwestern part of the state. Communications specialist Erin McHenry said state health officials are investigating “a cluster of cases” at the Castaway Club Young Life Camp on Pelican Lake, about 45 miles east of Fargo, North Dakota. The facility typically hosts teenagers from about 10 states, camp manager Greg Johnson said. Johnson said he’s aware of 10 virus cases involving staff members over the past two weeks, with no new infections in the last week. The number of infected guests wasn’t immediately known because cases might have been reported in other states, KVRR-TV reported. Johnson said when the outbreak began, special protocols were put into place that included an indoor mask mandate and in some circumstances an outdoor mask requirement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves does not plan to issue a mask mandate for schools, even as COVID-19 cases are proliferating in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. “Governor Reeves has no intention of requiring students and staff to wear masks when they’re in school this fall,” his spokeswoman, Bailey Martin, said Tuesday. A few Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others are starting by mid-August. Some parents have raised concerns about the virus spreading among children too young to be vaccinated, and many school districts have said they will not require students or employees to wear masks because the governor has not set a mask mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Garth Brooks fans will have a chance to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when the country music star performs at Arrowhead Stadium on Aug. 7. Chiefs president Mark Donovan said the team plans to take every opportunity to offer vaccinations at Arrowhead, The Kansas City Star reported. Donovan said the organization isn’t sure if it will be able to use Arrowhead Stadium as a vaccination site on Chiefs game days this fall but “we’re trying to work through that as well.” A vaccination clinic was held at Arrowhead Stadium in the spring.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Health officials have issued a safety advisory for a lake just outside Yellowstone National Park after harmful algal blooms toxic to humans and animals were detected. The bloom of algae was in Hebgen Lake, a reservoir in southwestern Montana near the borders of Idaho and Wyoming, officials said. NorthWestern Energy monitors six locations across the reservoir weekly, said company spokesperson Jo Dee Black. Warmer water temperatures and a lower-than-usual water level is causing more algae growth earlier in the season than in a typical year, Black told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Blue-green algae is native to Montana’s freshwater lakes and reservoirs and not all varieties are harmful. But some algal blooms produce toxins that pose a risk to people, pets and livestock when ingested or through prolonged contact, according to NorthWestern Energy and the Gallatin City-County Health Department. Don’t drink, swallow or swim in water that has harmful blooms, officials said. The blooms can look like pea soup, grass clippings or green latex paint and are typically suspended in the water and can appear as floating mats.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have arrested a man accused of attacking and shooting another man in the neck with a BB gun for wearing a mask. The incident happened Tuesday in the vestibule of a midtown grocery store as one man was leaving and another was entering, the Omaha World-Herald reported. One man was not wearing a mask, police said, and ran up to and spit on the other man, who was wearing a mask. A fight ensued, and police said the unmasked man pulled out a BB-gun replica of a pistol and shot the other man. The injured man told officers that when he demanded to know why he was attacked, the unmasked man responded, “You’re on the other team.” The victim suffered injuries to his face, neck and shoulder and had to pull a pellet out of his shoulder, he said. Officers arrested the accused shooter on suspicion of felony terroristic threats and misdemeanor assault.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada print news organization and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to ensure access to what could be the state’s first execution in 15 years. A federal lawsuit invoking First Amendment rights seeks a court order banning state prisons chief Charles Daniels from preventing witnesses, including reporters, from observing the lethal injection of convicted killer Zane Michael Floyd. State and federal judges have put off Floyd’s execution until at least late October to allow time for appeals to be heard. Aides to Gov. Steve Sisolak and state Attorney General Aaron Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by ACLU attorneys Friday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Ford’s office represents state officials in several court challenges of the execution plan. The lawsuit said witnesses should have “uninterrupted viewing” of the condemned man from the time he enters the execution chamber until he is declared dead, with an unfettered ability to hear and see the process. It points to an execution manual released in June, allowing the prisons chief to choose the number and names of media representatives. Floyd, who was a Marine, received the death penalty in 2000 for killing four people and wounding a fifth with a shotgun at a Las Vegas supermarket in 1999. He also was convicted of repeatedly raping a woman the night before the rampage. The last person executed in Nevada was Daryl Mack, who asked to die in 2006 following his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu said New Hampshire will not be issuing new mask guidance following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where COVID-19 transmission is substantial or high. Four of New Hampshire’s 10 counties and the city of Nashua are experiencing moderate transmission, and the rest of the state is seeing minimal transmission, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. “At this point, it isn’t about the government providing that bubble of safety around individuals,” Sununu told WMUR-TV. Instead, he said it’s about the individual taking on personal responsibility. “It is your choice,” Sununu said. “We have all the power to protect ourselves and the community, and that’s getting the vaccine. It’s safe. It’s easy.” More than 53% of the state has been fully vaccinated. Sununu said he’s frustrated that more residents are not vaccinated, given the extensive effort made by the state to get vaccines out to the public, but he said he understands it is a personal choice.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in New Jersey should wear masks indoors when there is an increased risk of spreading the coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Murphy said the state’s coronavirus metrics are going in the wrong direction, and new data suggested the delta variant is more transmissible, “which is why we are making this strong recommendation.” Instances where masks are recommended include: crowded indoor settings, those involving close contact with others who aren’t fully vaccinated and those where someone’s vaccine status is unknown. Murphy made the recommendation in a joint statement with Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. Murphy’s recommendation didn’t address schools. Murphy spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said Wednesday there was no update yet on masks in schools. New Jersey has among the highest percentages of people vaccinated in the country.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A bountiful wildflower bloom at Bandelier National Monument is drawing some early risers who want to avoid the midday crowds, and the visitors center is responding to accommodate them. Starting Sunday, the visitor center will open a half-hour earlier at 8:30 a.m. Acting Superintendent Dennis Milligan said that will give staff more time to hand out information on trails and safety. The Southwest has been inundated with rain during the monsoon season, bolstering wildflowers. Mariposa lilies, harebells and shooting stars are abundant along trails like the Cerro Grande and Alamo Boundary at Bandelier. Monument officials said the massive wildflower bloom should last for several more weeks. They said visitors should feel free to photograph the flowers but don’t pick them so others can enjoy the view. Visitation to the monument that features canyons and ancient cliff dwellings dropped drastically during the pandemic. Officials said they’re now seeing a 157% increase in visitation since 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: A village in the Hamptons will pay its outgoing police chief more than $774,000 for unused sick and vacation time after village officials voted to end his contract. Southampton Village Police Chief Thomas Cummings’ contract contained provisions that allowed for the large payout, Newsday reported Wednesday. The village board voted on July 20 to end his contract on Sept. 10 and approved the payout. The agreement calculated 686 unused days at $1,095 per day, plus almost $23,000 in retroactive per diem pay. The newspaper obtained the information through public records requests. Cummings, 57, has been police chief in the village of the wealthy enclave since 2011, after joining the department in 1987. He had clashed with Mayor Jesse Warren, who won reelection in June, the newspaper reported. Warren criticized the contract that allowed the large payout in a statement Tuesday. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. He and his wife will also get medical and dental benefits without premiums for the rest of their lives, unless his wife were to remarry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health department will require workers, volunteers and others at 14 state-run health care facilities to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Sept. 30 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, according to a memo. The Associated Press obtained a departmental FAQ about the vaccine mandate that said those who don’t get fully vaccinated or exempted by the deadline could face “disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for unacceptable personal conduct.” Republican House Speaker Tim Moore first shed light on the development through a news release Tuesday night. Although he is vaccinated and encourages others to get the shots, he said he believes residents should have the ability to make their own decisions without fear of reprisal. The speaker also noted that none of the available COVID-19 vaccines the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use have thus far received full FDA approval. North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services did not comment on Moore’s criticism, but confirmed it will require many within the Division of State Operated Health Facilities to get vaccinated. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s office has not responded to questions about whether the governor supports a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for state workers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWatford City: The operator of an oil well pad where a fire has been burning since last week in McKenzie County has brought in a specialized emergency response crew to get a handle on the blaze. The well pad is located on federal land just south of Lake Sakakawea northeast of Watford City. Its operator, Petro-Hunt, is working with Texas-based Wild Well Control. “They can come in and know how to analyze or diagnose the problem and get to it,” said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. McKenzie County Emergency Manager Karolin Jappe said authorities have closed roads in the area and are asking people to avoid driving or boating near the fire, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The cause of the fire, which broke out Jan. 22, is unknown. Clouds of black smoke are rising from the blaze, causing state environmental officials to encourage nearby residents to monitor their local air quality at www.airnow.gov. Air quality is already poor in parts of North Dakota because of wildfire smoke from the western U.S. and Canada. Petro-Hunt initially reported to the state that an estimated 100 barrels of oil and 100 barrels of saltwater spilled at the site. The true volume of the spills is not yet known, Glatt said. The fire is contained to the well pad, and it has not resulted in any injuries, according to Petro-Hunt.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:A vandal defaced a large LeBron James-inspired “Space Jam” mural in Akron. A red clown nose was spray painted on James’ face, along with the words “LA FLOP” sometime early Monday morning on the artwork created by Copley artist Chardae Slater on the front of a West Market Street business. The mural is located not far from James’ alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Vincent High School, and the I Promise School he helped found for at-risk Akron children. Akron Police have been alerted to the vandalism and Slater said she’s hopeful businesses near the mural will be willing to share any security camera footage they might have that captured the culprit or culprits. James’ representatives did not return a request for comment Monday about the recent vandalism. Slater said it might take up to two weeks to fix the mural. “It’s fixable,” she said. “It’s just oh my God. I’m trying to keep positive.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: City employees who are unvaccinated for the coronavirus will not receive hazard leave if they contract the illness, Mayor G.T Bynum said. Hazard leave is paid leave that is not counted against sick days or vacation days, city spokesperson Michelle Brooks said. Affected unvaccinated employees could use sick days or vacation if they become ill with the virus. Ascension St. John Hospital in Tulsa announced its employees would be required to become vaccinated by Nov. 12, with exemptions possible for medical or religious regions. “Tens of thousands of Ascension associates have already been vaccinated with the available vaccines, as have millions of people across the country and the world,” Ascension said in a statement. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve.” Ascension joins OU Health, Mercy and SSM Health as hospitals in the state requiring employee vaccinations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A former Oregon lawmaker who was expelled for letting violent protesters into the state Capitol pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of official misconduct. The Statesman Journal reported that Mike Nearman was sentenced to 18 months probation, during which he will need to complete 80 hours of community service and is banned from the Capitol building and grounds. He will also pay $200 in court fees and $2,700 to the Oregon Legislative Administration for damages done during the Dec. 21 riot. As part of the agreement in Marion County Circuit Court, a count of criminal trespass was dismissed. Last month, Nearman, a Republican from Polk County, became the first member of the Oregon House to be expelled in its 160-year history. The House voted 59-1 to remove him from the Legislature for disorderly behavior. Nearman was seen on security video opening a door to protesters on Dec. 21 as lawmakers met in emergency session to deal with economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters barged into the building, which was closed to the public because of pandemic safety protocols, got into shoving matches with police and sprayed officers with bear spray. Some of the protesters had guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering a statewide mask mandate as coronavirus cases surge in Pennsylvania and across the country, and his administration said it is not requiring masks in schools. Wolf, speaking on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, said his strategy to fight the spread of COVID-19 has been the vaccine, and will continue to be. The masking mandate was for when there was no vaccine, Wolf said. “People have the ability, each individual to make the decision to get a vaccine,” Wolf said. “If they do, that’s the protection.” Wolf’s administration also said it is not considering mandating masks in K-12 schools. However, it said it is recommending that Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvania schools follow federal guidance on mask-wearing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s two largest health care systems are requiring all employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The announcements Tuesday by Lifespan and Care New England – which are moving toward a merger – came as the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention issued new face-covering guidelines. “It is our responsibility to keep our patients, and our staff, safe. This program will be based on the best evidence that we have to date about preventing transmission of COVID-19,” Dr. James Fanale, Care New England’s chief executive, said in a statement. Care New England said it would “move toward” requiring vaccinations by first requiring that all managers receive a first dose before Labor Day. More details will be released within the next seven to 10 days. Lifespan announced that its vaccine mandate will go into effect Sept. 1, and it is the system’s goal to have all employees show proof of immunization within 60 days. Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Bradley, Newport, and The Miriam hospitals. Care New England operates Butler, Kent, and Women & Infants hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are looking for people who might have come in contact with a rabid puppy or its missing littermate along the Georgia-South Carolina border. The Department of Health and Environmental Control said the agency recently identified a rabid puppy that was born in Edgefield County, near Lanier Road in the town of Johnston. The small, tan-and-white pit bull puppy was approximately 7 weeks old and weighed about 5 pounds. The dog and a littermate were taken to Augusta, Georgia, between July 14 and July 17. Both puppies were also taken to a gathering in Clearwater, South Carolina, about that time, the agency said. The rabid puppy was also taken to a birthday party in Florence, South Carolina. Health officials have yet to find the littermate or identify its rabies status. The health agency is now searching for people who attended the Clearwater gathering or might have had contact with the littermate puppy. “We are deeply concerned about all persons involved, as rabies is fatal if left untreated after exposure,” said Dr. Gil Potter, Midlands Region Medical Director. People who came in contact with the puppy’s saliva should seek medical attention, as they might have been exposed to rabies, the agency said. Animals can shed the virus for up to two weeks before showing symptoms of rabies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Staff and inmates at South Dakota prisons are no longer required to wear masks following an order from Gov. Kristi Noem lifting the requirement. Among neighboring states, South Dakota is the only one to lift a mask requirement in prisons, the Argus Leader reported. Noem’s move was spurred by a meeting she had with employees at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. They cheered when she told them they could remove their masks during a meeting Friday. The governor was at the prison to respond to an ongoing human resources investigation into complaints of low employee morale, shorthanded prison staff and insufficient tactical gear for corrections officers. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury told the Argus Leader the governor would have made the move even sooner if she was aware of the Department of Corrections policy. He said it was “common sense” given the rate of virus cases and would help boost employee morale. The Department of Corrections said 70% of inmates have received at least one vaccination. It does not track the vaccination rate among staff.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A group of state Senate Republicans are urging the public to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a move that comes as case numbers are beginning to again climb throughout the state. “Unfortunately, efforts to get more people vaccinated have been hampered by politicization of COVID-19,” the group of 17 lawmakers wrote in a letter Tuesday. “This should not be political.” Tennessee has faced increased national scrutiny over its low COVID-19 vaccination rates after the Department of Health fired its top vaccination chief and briefly halted outreach for childhood vaccines. Some GOP leaders have since gone on the defensive, with Gov. Bill Lee urging Tennesseans to get a COVID-19 shot after remaining mum on the subject for several weeks. On Tuesday, Senate Republican leadership reiterated that getting the vaccine was a “personal choice” but encouraged people to talk to their doctor about the vaccination.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Two people are dead and 30 were hospitalized after a chemical leak at a Houston-area plant, officials said. LyondellBasell said that about 100,000 pounds of a mixture that included acetic acid was released in the leak that started Tuesday night at its La Porte Complex. The company said that the “all clear” was given early Wednesday, and that the leak had been isolated and contained. The company said air monitoring was ongoing and hasn’t shown “actionable levels.” Two contractors were killed and 30 workers were taken to local hospitals for evaluation and treatment, the company said. Of those, it said 24 were treated and released. The names of the contractors who died were not immediately released. The cause was under investigation, the company said, adding it was cooperating with authorities. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen said that the chemicals involved can severely burn skin and are toxic if inhaled.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Flash floods caused extensive damage in Cedar City and led Mayor Maile Wilson-Edwards to declare a state of emergency. Residents of the basement apartments at University West Apartments said they lost everything they own after the flood waters reached several feet high, Fox13 news reported. Cheryl Beeston said her daughter and son-in-law, Cheyenne and Kyle Brunson, were at work when the floods hit, but their home is ruined. “It’s worse than I ever expected. They’ve been married – it’ll be five months tomorrow – and they’ve lost everything,” she said. One volunteer did manage to find her daughter’s wedding ring, though. “We’re so grateful for that,” Beeston said. “We’re grateful for all the help that’s here.” Parts of the Southern Utah University campus, including the stadium were also damaged alongside entire neighborhoods, business complexes and roads. A Walmart parking lot became a waist-high pond and drivers waded out to their cars with help from Walmart employees.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:More than a dozen blood donation opportunities are scheduled across Vermont in August as the American Red Cross is reporting a severe blood shortage. The need for donations is higher this summer as more people are seeking treatment after deferring care during the coronavirus pandemic, Northern New England Red Cross spokeswoman Mary Brant told the Burlington Free Press. Organ transplants and elective surgeries have increased. Hospital emergency rooms also are handling more trauma cases, Brant said. The Red Cross has been distributing 12% more blood products to hospitals across the country than it was during the same time last year, the newspaper reported. Vermonters are urged to make an appointment now to give blood by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, visiting redcrossblood.org or downloading the Red Cross Blood Donor app on a smartphone.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam introduced two more spending proposals for the state’s $4.3 billion share of federal coronavirus relief money, calling for investments in clean water projects and more than $860 million to replenish the fund that pays unemployment benefits. The Democratic governor has been incrementally rolling out his spending plans ahead of a special legislative session that begins next week, when lawmakers will vote on how to allocate the money from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said the state will follow federal guidance and recommend that people wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas where there is a worrying rate of COVID-19 - including people who are fully vaccinated. Inslee also said the state will continue to require that all students and employees of K-12 schools wear masks when instruction resumes for the upcoming school year. Inslee’s office said the masking guidance for the general public indoors in places with a substantial or high COVID-19 rate is a recommendation only, but the school masking requirement is state law. Health officials in more than a half-dozen western Washington counties were already recommending mask-wearing in indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status because of a rise in COVID-19 cases and the highly infectious delta variant.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The Clarksburg Water Board has made $416,000 available in its budget to address lead found in some customers’ household drinking water. The board won’t make capital purchases this year and postponed buying items including lab equipment and three trucks, The Exponent Telegram reported. “These items are needed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in the budget,” Jason Myers, the board’s general manager, said at a meeting on Tuesday. “However, with public health in mind … we’re willing to forgo this.” The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said funds are available to help with the problem but asked the board to outline how much of its own money could be used, according to Myers. On top of available aid from the health department and the Environmental Protection Agency, the board plans to request funding from the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council. The region’s planning and development council is also helping to find funding sources. Of the 120 water samples collected for lead testing that were returned as of Tuesday afternoon, only one was above an allowable limit set by the EPA. The lead issue was discovered when drinking water samples were collected from the homes of three children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels. The toxic metal can be particularly harmful to children. Multiple sources of exposure were identified, so the water couldn’t have been the sole cause of the higher levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he is stepping down from the volunteer position he has held since April 2019. Andrew Hitt departure comes just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, where Republicans are trying to retain the U.S. Senate seat held by Ron Johnson and defeat Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Hitt, 43, said he will leave the post upon election of a successor, which will take place by early September. Hitt, from Appleton, is an attorney with the Michael Best and Friedrich law firm and also is a partner in its lobbying arm, Michael Best Strategies. Hitt said he was leaving to focus on his family and private sector career. “It’s bittersweet to step down now with such an exciting election cycle ahead, but I know it is the right thing to do for my family and employer after the sacrifices they made so I could provide steady leadership at a crucial time,” Hitt said in a statement. Hitt was a visible chairman, working closely with party activists, insiders and office holders, raising money and also being the public face for the GOP in the media. During his time as chairman, the state GOP opened its first office in Milwaukee and also suffered a cyberattack where $2.3 million was stolen.\n\nWyoming\n\nDayton: Investigators found a man dead after a boy allegedly told authorities in Montana he killed his father. The 15-year-old allegedly confessed to authorities in the Hardin, Montana, area, leading investigators to find the body at a home in Dayton early Wednesday, Sheridan County sheriff’s officials said in a statement. Sheriff’s officials didn’t identify the boy or dead man. Sheriff’s officials and Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents were investigating, according to the statement. There was no threat to the public and people should keep away from the home to allow a thorough investigation, Undersheriff Levi Dominguez said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/14/year-lake-dives-whale-swallows-lobsterman-hitting-trails-news-around-states/117004800/", "title": "A year of lake dives, whale swallows lobsterman: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Work is beginning on a 120-acre development that’s meant to bring new attractions and visitors to the capital city with whitewater rafting and other activities. Located just west of the downtown area near the Alabama River, the estimated $50 million Montgomery Whitewater is set to open in 2023 with a combination of public contributions and private financing. Officials gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday. Using a system that recirculates water, the project will include whitewater rafting, kayaking, paddle boats and canoeing. It will also have mountain bike trails, climbing areas, zip lines and rope courses. Montgomery got a boost in tourism when a national lynching memorial opened in 2018, and officials hope the whitewater development brings additional people to town while revitalizing an area near Interstate 65. “The whitewater project can be a catalyst to transform our city and this entire region. We are being intentional in our work to attract new opportunities for growth and investment by marketing areas outside of traditional development zones,” Mayor Steven Reed said in a statement. The park is expected to employ about 640 people with an estimated financial impact of more than $35 million annually.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The federal government announced plans Friday to “repeal or replace” a decision by the Trump administration last fall to lift restrictions on logging and road building in a southeast Alaska rainforest that provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon. Conservationists cheered the announcement as a positive step, while Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy criticized it and vowed to use “every tool available to push back.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plans were announced on a federal regulatory site with little detail. They were described as consistent with a January executive order from President Joe Biden that called for reviewing agency actions during the Trump administration that could be at odds with Biden’s environmental priorities. The U.S. Forest Service falls under the USDA. The Tongass National Forest is the country’s largest national forest. In a statement, Matt Herrick, an Agriculture Department spokesperson, said the Trump administration decision “did not align with the overwhelming majority of public opinion across the country and among Alaskans.” The Agriculture Department last October decided to exempt the Tongass from the so-called roadless rule, which prohibited road construction and timber harvests with limited exceptions. That rule, dating to 2001, has long been the subject of litigation.\n\nArizona\n\nSierra Vista: Operators of a new youth community center are hoping it becomes an inviting hangout for the town of Naco – the one in Arizona and the one in Mexico. El Centro Community Center, just a stone’s throw from the Mexican border, opened its doors this month. The facility is in its early stages, with details still being decided, but classes will be offered in person and online. Its founders envision a bicultural refuge where students on both sides could learn about art, music and each other. Co-founders Lori Keyne and Seth Polley said they want teens to celebrate different cultures while gaining valuable skills. “In the aftermath of COVID, it’s good to be with each other,” Polley, a history teacher at Bisbee High School and former reverend, told the Sierra Vista Herald/Bisbee Review. “We would like to have a space where people can come together for various activities, music, language, have a coffee, a place to hang out.” Keyne, a music teacher at Cochise College and the founder of Concerts Without Borders and the Bi-National Arts Institute, said she wants to impart knowledge not only about the arts but also on subjects like job skills and entrepreneurship. The center includes a front room lounge with a bar area where coffee will be served, with teens interested in understanding how a business works helping to run it.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman who says she was injured when a state trooper deliberately bumped into her SUV, causing it to flip, when she didn’t immediately pull over for a traffic stop is suing him and the agency. An attorney for Janice Nicole Harper filed the lawsuit last month in Pulaski County against trooper Rodney Dunn, several of his supervisors and the Arkansas State Police, alleging negligence and excessive use of force. The suit alleges that Harper slowed down, activated her blinker and emergency lights, and was looking for a safe place to pull over after Dunn initiated a traffic stop in July 2020. Dashboard video from Dunn’s cruiser shows the trooper performed a “pursuit intervention technique,” or PIT maneuver, about two minutes after initiating the stop. “There were no exits or shoulder for plaintiff to safely exit the highway, before defendant Dunn negligently executed a PIT maneuver on plaintiff’s vehicle two minutes and seven seconds after defendant Dunn initiated his Arkansas State Police patrol cruiser overhead lights, which caused plaintiff’s vehicle to flip,” the lawsuit says. The state police have not formally responded to the lawsuit, and a spokesman for the agency declined to comment Friday because the lawsuit is pending.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The federal government has reached an agreement to restore nearly $1 billion in funding for California’s troubled bullet train, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced. The U.S. Department of Transportation finalized settlement negotiations to restore the money for the high-speed rail project that was revoked by the Trump administration in 2019, Newsom said Thursday night. The restoration of $929 million in grant funding “will continue to spur job creation, advance the project and move the state one step closer to getting trains running in California as soon as possible,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. California voters in 2008 approved nearly $10 billion in bond money to build a high-speed rail line connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco that was supposed to be running by 2020. But the project was plagued by cost overruns and delays. Officials now hope to have trains running on a segment through the state’s central valley agricultural region by 2029. Critics have derided the segment as a “train to nowhere,” but supporters say it’s a necessary test and precursor to linking more populated areas. The project’s business plan anticipates environmental approval for the 500 miles between Los Angeles and San Francisco by 2023. Completion of the full line depends on funding and other unknowns.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Legislature launched an ambitious path to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating economic and social consequences during the 2021 session, with majority Democrats doling out millions of dollars to dozens of business and health care needs. They also strengthened a state greenhouse gas emissions plan, passed gun measures, and mandated reduced health insurance premiums and costs for individuals and small businesses. A transportation funding plan that eluded lawmakers for years was approved, as were measures addressing racial disparities in health care and criminal justice. And lawmakers followed up on a sweeping 2020 police accountability bill that was passed during protests over the killing of George Floyd. Republicans fought in vain against a hastily prepared, last-minute bill that, in part, requires rural electric cooperatives – and power providers including larger utilities – to prepare clean energy plans for the state. It also directs the Air Quality Control Commission, a panel appointed by the governor, to create fees on greenhouse gas emissions and regulate emissions sources that directly affect lower-income Coloradans and communities of color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSomers: The state has closed the maximum-security prison that once housed the state’s death row. Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that the Northern Correctional Institution, the state’s highest-security prison, was taken out of service three weeks ahead of the target date of July 1. The decision to close the prison was announced in February. Northern is the first of three prisons the Connecticut Department of Correction plans to shutter amid lower crime rates and an inmate population that has declined during the pandemic. The state has yet to name the other two. The state’s inmate population has been hovering around 9,000 in recent weeks, a drop of about 3,400 people over the past 15 months. Northern, which was designed in pods to keep high-security inmates isolated, once housed more than 500 prisoners but has not had more than 100 in more than a year. In February, a lawsuit filed on behalf of prisoners alleged the use of prolonged isolation and in-cell shackling was violating the rights of mentally ill inmates. Last week the General Assembly passed legislation banning the use of solitary confinement in most cases and the use of certain restraints. The last of Northern’s inmates were transferred to other high-security settings last Monday, Lamont’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: A conservation group says about 200,000 juvenile menhaden died in a fish kill off Rehoboth Bay. The Delaware Center for the Inland Bays said a lack of dissolved oxygen in the water was responsible for the kill. Residents discovered the dead fish Thursday in a residential canal. Menhaden are a small, oily bait fish that serve as a food source for other species and a prime source for fish oil supplements. While it may have once been a natural tributary of Rehoboth Bay, the canal was at some point altered to allow boats to travel and dock there, said Chris Bason, executive director of the inland bays center. It features manmade walls as opposed to a natural shoreline. “It’s no longer done that way because it has tremendous environmental impacts,” Bason said. “That’s how we lost a lot of our salt marshes around the inland bays.” Such canals can be heavily polluted by runoff from adjacent properties, and Bason said some homes even pipe stormwater directly into the canals. Because they weren’t created by tides’ natural ebb and flow, they often have poor flushing. “It can create dangerous environmental conditions for the animals,” Bason said. While urban runoff is a major cause of pollution in Rehoboth Bay, Bason said the biggest contributor is likely fertilizer and treated wastewater applied to farmlands.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In what organizers say was a surprise turn of events, the Capital Pride Alliance has hosted its first in-person Pride event since the pandemic hit, WUSA-TV reports. The district fully reopened Friday, allowing for crowds to storm the streets Saturday afternoon, sporting the hallmark rainbows of LGBTQ flags. “We’ve been locked up for so long, and just the feeling of being able to come out and come together as a family as a community is huge,” Capital Pride Alliance President Ashley Smith said. Hundreds marched from DuPont Circle to Freedom Plaza, where Mayor Muriel Bowser spoke. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, met the crowds en route. Harris spoke, walked and waved to Pride supporters. “We understand the importance of this movement and our roles of leadership in this ongoing movement,” Harris said about the Biden administration’s support of the LGBTQ community. She also spoke about securing further rights for those of the transgender community at a time when school districts and legislatures across the country are facing debates about inclusion in sports and the use of pronouns that reflect students’ gender identity.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law Friday that is meant to give relief to a large sector of the state’s insurance industry. Faced with losses from rising claims, the industry welcomed changes that would restrict some practices by contractors. The law would forbid contractors from soliciting homeowners to file roofing claims. It also narrows the time frame in which homeowners can file claims from three years to two years and enacts new rules on litigation. While some insurers say the new measures will help keep costs down, critics say they could raise premiums on homeowners who get coverage from the state’s provider of last resort. The same legislation raised the cap on annual rate increases that the government-backed insurer, Citizens Property Insurance, can charge its customers. That cap will rise from 10% to 15% over the next five years. Insurers had sought much more from lawmakers during this year’s legislative session but had to settle for a scaled-back bill that removed some key provisions – including one that would have allowed insurers to more strictly limit coverage for replacing damaged roofs. The Republican governor signed the bill after holding a brief roundtable in Sarasota.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The pastor of a vandalized church said he doesn’t want to seek criminal charges but instead seeks to reach out to the person who left the graffiti. “My concern was not about the building. It was about the person,” Will Dyer told WJBF-TV on Tuesday after finding “God is dead” and “Christians are the problem” spray-painted on the walls of First Baptist Church. “I know you probably won’t read this post, but if you do, I would love to meet you. I would love to hear your story and share a meal at the table,” Dyer wrote on Facebook. “If you sit down at a table and you share a meal with someone, you might not emerge agreeing on everything, but it’s hard to hate someone that you share a meal with.” The pastor said he wants to use the incident to spread his message. “I had no idea it would go viral, but I thought, ‘What would I want to say to the person who did this?’ ” Dyer said. He said the church “will absolutely not press charges.” “That is not something we are interested in,” Dyer said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKekaha: Researchers have documented a decrease in Kauai’s population of rose-ringed parakeets, an invasive species plaguing local farms. The island had a minimum of 7,300 of the parakeets this year, down from 10,500 last year, said Jane Anderson, assistant professor of research at Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute of Texas A&M University – Kingsville. Tiffani Keanini, manager of Kauai Invasive Species Committee, said her organization launched a campaign to get people to report parakeets roosts, where large numbers of the birds gather to sleep at night. Mango farmer Wally Johnson of Kekaha told The Garden Island newspaper he first saw the parakeets six to seven years ago. He’s had workers scare them away with shotguns. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Wildlife Research Center suggests controlling their numbers by capturing birds with live traps or with long-handled nets at roosting spots. Anderson said Kauai’s parakeets are believed to have descended from pets that were released in the 1960s. They damage crops because they flock in groups of 50 to 100. They’re been known to eat corn, lychee, citrus, mango, longan and papaya. “This is impacting the large cornfields as well as local fruit farms and backyard growers,” Anderson said.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A woman whose visit to China turned into a year-and-a-half exile because of the pandemic finally returned home this month, only to find her home practically unlivable, plundered by a bevy of squatters. “I came back from vacation and found my house in a mess,” Helen Wong, 70, told The Lewiston Tribune. “I cannot do it (clean up by myself). I feel so helpless.” But a deputy from the Nez Perce County Sheriff’s Office rallied the community to help her get things back in order. Jesse Broyles happened upon Wong outside the county jail as she was trying in vain to replace her ID, and the story Wong told floored him. The COVID-19 outbreak slammed the door on her return from a “vacation” to her homeland in late 2019. China eventually eased its travel restrictions, but Wong just recently decided her health would be safe in the tight confines of a jumbo jet. Then she arrived home to find it abused and partially dismantled by squatters, 18 of whom had to be rousted by the Lewiston Police Department, and almost all her belongings were stolen. To make matters worse, her wallet went missing that day, and without her proof of residency, she couldn’t even replace her ID so that she could pay for groceries with a check. Spurred by a Facebook post from Broyles, volunteers and donors have stepped in to get Wong through the crisis.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A bus driver looking for a way to relieve stress during the coronavirus pandemic jumped into Lake Michigan for a 365th straight day Saturday. Dan O’Conor said he started jumping into the lake at Montrose Harbor on the city’s North Side last year to relieve stress. “It was during the pandemic, it was during the protest, it was during an election year … so it was somewhere where I could come down here and block all that noise out and kind of be totally present with me in the lake and find some moments of Zen,” the father of three said. He continued his lake jumps through the fall before the hard part: hacking a hole in the ice on the frozen lake that was big enough for him to jump through during the winter. He said when he got home after one such jump, he found about 20 scrapes and cuts on his body. He was encouraged by the response he got for his undertaking. “People started asking me what this was benefiting and how they could support – and when I say people, I’m talking strangers online, you know. When I started posting the videos on Twitter and Instagram ... I got more wind in my sails there because people started commenting like, ‘This makes my day, it’s nice to see this,’ ” he said. Saturday was special because it was the culmination of doing it for a full year. “I just wanted to celebrate just that drive to dive for 365,” O’Conor said.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Former Vice President Mike Pence is spending his post-vice presidency days in a $1.93million house he and his wife, Karen, purchased in Hamilton County, according to the sales disclosure form. The 10,300-square-foot house, which sits on a 5-acre lot on the northwest side of Carmel, has seven bedrooms, 7.5 bathrooms and an in-ground pool, according to a Realtor.com listing. There’s also a dock overlooking a pond, an indoor basketball court and a lower-level media room. Pictures of the house – built in 2008, according to Realtor.com – show four garages, a spacious basement bar, a workout room and a stone fireplace on the main level. The house has a Zionsville postal address but is within the city limits of Carmel, which voted primarily for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. But Pence – along with former President Donald Trump – won overall in Hamilton County with 52.2% of the vote. Biden received more than 51% of the vote in Carmel and Clay Township in 2020, according to an analysis in November. Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard, a Republican, welcomed Pence to the city and pointed out that Pence would not be the first vice president to settle in Carmel, following in the footsteps of Dan Quayle, a native Hoosier who served as vice president from 1989 to 1993 under George H.W. Bush.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: The bright red Quaker Oats sign that had long lit up the Cedar Rapids skyline before a rare wind storm damaged it last August is back atop the Quaker Oats plant near downtown. The new sign installed June 1 is a near-exact replica of the old sign but sports all LED lights and took hundreds of hours of labor over six months to reconstruct, The Gazette reports. The previous neon sign first lit up in 1947 and was the largest electric sign in the city at the time. Nesper Sign Advertising of Cedar Rapids created the new version, and Nesper president Phil Garland said it uses about one-sixth of the power of the old sign. “It’s not glass, so it’s safer as far as if it ever were to get broken in a storm – falling glass is obviously not a good thing,” Garland said. Nesper Sign also will replace a second sign at the plant, facing the Cedar River.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Psychiatric facilities have enough beds to treat children in need of intensive mental health care in the state, but a worker shortage means that about 100 of those spots remain empty. Kansas News Service reports that in recent years, children have often waited months for openings in specialized facilities that offer long-term psychiatric care. In mid-2018, the average wait was nearly 200 days. The wait time fell in 2019 and 2020, and as of last month, the average wait was 44 days. Yet 146 children remain in line for their turn, even though 104 beds are open. Residential care centers are struggling to fill jobs that are physically and emotionally taxing yet sometimes pay less than $15 an hour. KidsTLC in Olathe is urging the state to help with incentives that could range from college tuition waivers and signing bonuses to subsidies for health insurance or child care. KidsTLC bought land in March 2020 to add another 50 beds for children, and that work was finished in December, nearly doubling KidsTLC’s residential capacity. Forty-five of the new beds remain empty. “We had space; we were licensed and were feeling just exceptional about that and being able to make a significant dent in that waitlist,” CEO Erin Dugan said. “And then it became really hard to hire staff.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday declared his state’s deadly fight against COVID-19 a “success story” as he ended most pandemic restrictions, and he said his state lessened the crisis because Kentuckians ultimately put science ahead of politics. The Democratic governor – who confronted protests, lawsuits and impeachment petitions over his coronavirus-related executive actions – expressed frustration that mask mandates meant to slow the virus’s spread became a “question of liberty.” Bringing the coronavirus under control required collective efforts of Democrats and Republicans, offering a lesson to move beyond the partisan strife that “can just be toxic,” Beshear said in an interview with the Associated Press, the first sit-down interview he had given in person in more than a year. Shortly before announcing he was lifting capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other venues, Beshear said the pandemic was “a test of our humanity” and posed “the single deadliest threat” of his lifetime. Kentucky’s virus-related death toll has surpassed 7,000. Still, “when you look at our response, I think you see a success story, and that’s obviously comparative and based on what could have happened,” Beshear said. “We know that our actions saved thousands, likely tens of thousands of lives,” he said later at his last media briefing on the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For the second year in a row, organizers have canceled a Halloween weekend music festival in the city. Last year’s Voodoo Music and Arts Experience was among many festivals around the world canceled last year because of COVID-19-related restrictions. A brief message posted Thursday on the festival’s website didn’t say why there won’t be one this October. People who have already bought tickets will be emailed about options to use them in 2022 or get refunds, it said. “As our city reopens with an abundance of events to reconnect with, we look forward to holding our reunion when we can fully embrace the Voodoo experience,” the statement said. With Louisiana’s pandemic restrictions over, other festivals are coming back. French Quarter Festivals Inc. announced weeks ago that its Satchmo Summerfest would take place July 31-Aug. 1. On Thursday it released the lineup for the city’s first post-pandemic in-person festival. The Essence Festival of Culture, which was online last year, plans a hybrid festival June 25-27 and July 2-4. Several spring festivals have been moved to the fall. The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival will be Oct. 8-17, bracketed by the French Quarter Festival on Sept. 30-Oct. 3 and Buku: Planet B on Oct. 22-23.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gov. Janet Mills announced Friday that the state of civil emergency she declared at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic will expire at month’s end. The Democrat called the end of the emergency orders put in place 15 months ago “a welcome milestone” that demonstrates the state’s progress in getting people vaccinated and reducing the spread of the virus. “Today, we take another important step forward in our return to normal,” the Democratic governor said. More than 73% of those 12 and older have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and about 65% are fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination tracker. The governor said she extended the civil emergency order, due to expire June 13, a final time through June 30 to ensure an orderly transition out of the emergency. The state’s last remaining mask requirement, which only applies to students from elementary through high school while indoors and to those in child care settings, will also end June 30.\n\nMaryland\n\nSeverna Park: A rededication ceremony is planned for a lynching memorial marker that was damaged in a vehicle accident. The organization Connecting the Dots posted on Facebook that work began Thursday to install the marker at the Severna Park Library. The group posted photos showing volunteers preparing a foundation in the soil for the marker. The group said a rededication ceremony is scheduled for Tuesday evening. A discussion on slavery and its legacy of racism is planned for afterward. The marker was initially installed in 2019 to memorialize five victims of lynching in Anne Arundel County but was damaged by a bus. Connecting the Dots is an organization in the county that works on “connecting the dots between slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and police brutality against the Black community.” The rededication ceremony was first reported by The Capital Gazette.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A commercial lobster diver who got caught in the mouth of a humpback whale off the coast of Cape Cod on Friday morning said he thought he was going to die. Michael Packard, 56, of Wellfleet, was about 10 feet from the bottom of the water off Herring Cove Beach when, in something truly biblical, he was swallowed whole by the whale. “All of a sudden, I felt this huge shove, and the next thing I knew, it was completely black,” Packard recalled Friday afternoon following his release from Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis. “I could sense I was moving, and I could feel the whale squeezing with the muscles in his mouth.” Initially, Packard thought he was inside a great white shark, but he couldn’t feel any teeth and hadn’t suffered any obvious wounds. It quickly dawned on him that he had been swallowed by a whale. “I thought to myself, ‘There’s no way I’m getting out of here. I’m done. I’m dead.’ All I could think of was my boys – they’re 12 and 15 years old.” Outfitted with scuba gear, he struggled, and the whale began shaking its head such that Packard could tell he didn’t like it. He estimated he was in the whale for 30 to 40 seconds before it finally surfaced. “I saw light, and he started throwing his head side to side, and the next thing I knew, I was outside (in the water),” he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Republican-controlled Legislature can repeal a law that was the backbone of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s coronavirus orders, without her interference, after a unanimous decision Friday from the Michigan Supreme Court. The order to certify the ballot measure came after two Democrats on the Board of State Canvassers opposed ratifying it in April, despite a finding from the elections bureau that enough signatures had been collected. The justices said the panel “has a clear legal duty to certify the petition.” The seven-member board’s three Democrats had called for further investigation into alleged wrongdoing by paid circulators. For months, the Democratic governor acted under the 1945 emergency powers law to issue and keep intact restrictions on the economy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional last fall, but the conservative group Unlock Michigan wants to kill it to prevent a future court from deciding differently. Since the decision, Whitmer has turned to the state health department to tighten and ease restrictions. Indoor capacity limits will go away July 1, as will most mask requirements. The canvassers will meet soon to certify the petition. The GOP-controlled Legislature will likely enact the measure rather than let it go to a public vote in 2022.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota State Fair is coming back. The fair was canceled last year amid COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing recommendations. But fair officials announced Friday that the beloved event will return Aug. 26 and run through Labor Day on Sept. 6. Dubbed the “Great Minnesota Get-Back-Together,” a play on the fair’s traditional “Great Minnesota Get Together” moniker, the fair will not limit daily attendance or require masks, although fair officials ask that anyone who isn’t vaccinated against COVID-19 wear them. They did warn that some parts of the fair will look different. For example, the River Raft Ride, Go Karts, Giant Sing Along and Festival of Nations Demonstration Stage will not be offered this year. The llama costume contest will move to the Warner Coliseum, which offers more seating. The fair will feature dozens of newborn animals but no live births. The fairgrounds and most exhibits will close an hour earlier on Labor Day than in years past. Tickets purchased for the 2020 fair before it was canceled will be valid this year, officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Due to lagging demand for shots, the state has not accepted new COVID-19 vaccine doses from the federal government for two weeks and has asked that well over three-quarters of a million doses the U.S. government set aside for the state be transferred elsewhere, officials say. In recent months, Mississippi has transferred 871,950 vaccine doses to Rhode Island, Maine and a nationwide vaccine pool, said Liz Sharlot, spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Health. Maine is among the states in the U.S. with the highest vaccination rates. “In Mississippi, if people don’t understand how important it is to keep alive, we want to protect other Americans,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a virtual press briefing Friday, speaking about the decision to limit the number of doses accepted. Officials with the state Department of Health review the number of doses made available for Mississippi to order each week and determine whether to order additional doses or send them to the federal pool for other states to use. Mississippi has the lowest vaccination rate in the country, with about 29% of residents fully vaccinated. Just over 930,650 people in the state have received a full series of COVID-19 shots, according to data provided by the state Department of Health.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Police will be barred from enforcing federal gun laws that regulate weapons registration, tracking and possession of firearms by some domestic violence offenders under a bill that Gov. Mike Parson, a former sheriff, said he would sign into law. Passage of what’s dubbed the Second Amendment Preservation Act represents a victory for conservatives who have pushed the legislation for nearly a decade and picked up new momentum this year by responding to the Biden administration’s vows to enact stricter gun control. It’s been met by outrage and alarm from Democrats and gun control advocates, who have slammed the measure as dangerous in a state with such high rates of gun violence. Missouri had the nation’s third-highest per capita rate of gun deaths in 2020. In particular, gun control advocates have focused on what they call the “domestic violence loophole” that the legislation would solidify. Federal law prohibits gun possession for those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors, but when Missouri passed a permitless concealed carry law in 2016, sheriffs were no longer conducting background checks. Under the new bill, that federal limitation is one of many gun laws that would be declared “invalid” in the state. Missouri law only prohibits felons and fugitives from having guns.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of a new law allowing the governor to directly nominate judges to fill vacancies – giving Gov. Greg Gianforte and the Republican-controlled Legislature a win in the first of a series of challenges to laws passed by the 2021 Legislature. In a 6-1 ruling Thursday, the court said the Montana Constitution states that judicial vacancies may be filled in a manner provided by law, and the Legislature created a new law. Under the Senate bill that led to the law, the governor can directly nominate qualified candidates to fill judicial vacancies. Previously, the Judicial Nomination Commission vetted applicants and forwarded three to five names to the governor, who appointed a judge using the list. “The Montana Supreme Court reaffirmed what we’ve known to be true: SB 140 is constitutional, and our Constitution gives the legislature the authority to determine how the governor fills a judicial vacancy,” Gianforte said in a statement. “I will appoint judges who will interpret laws, not make them from the bench, and who are committed to the fair, consistent, and objective application of the law.” Justice Laurie McKinnon dissented, saying delegates to the 1972 Constitutional Convention intended to prevent the direct gubernatorial appointment of judges.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Shooters and representatives of the firearms industry have again descended upon Grand Island to keep the world safe from zombies. About 265 people took part in the Zombies in the Heartland party this month at Heartland Shooting Park, The Grand Island Independent reports. Participants use weapons to engage with “zombie-themed stages and targets,” said Jeremy Millard of Hornady Manufacturing. By taking aim at targets made of steel and paper, people can live out fantasies derived “from watching ‘The Walking Dead’ or ‘Shaun of the Dead’ or ‘World War Z,’ ” Millard told the newspaper. Some of the steel targets collapse when hit by ammunition. Another target, in the shape of a head, is built around a green clay target, so shooters get the feeling of shooting out a zombie’s brains. Zombies in the Heartland, which began in 2012, is one of only two or three zombie-themed shooting matches in the country, Millard said. Participants use three different guns: a shotgun, a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol. Vendors provide products that are given out as awards “for shooting well or as an incentive to come out and have a good time,” Millard said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State prison officials disclosed Thursday that they want to use a never-before-tried combination of drugs for Nevada’s first lethal injection in 15 years, including the powerful opioid fentanyl, the sedative ketamine and a heart-stopping salt, potassium chloride. Deputy federal public defenders representing convicted murderer Zane Michael Floyd promised courtroom challenges of the plan. A just-completed execution manual provided to a federal judge said a similar-acting drug, alfentanil, might substitute for fentanyl, and potassium acetate might substitute for potassium chloride. In an alternate four-drug procedure, the muscle paralytic cisatracurium would also be used to stop the condemned man’s ability to breathe before he receives the heart-stopping agent. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware II said he may issue a stay of execution ahead of a possible late July death date to allow time to review the choice of drugs and the 65-page execution manual. A state judge in Las Vegas on Monday gave the go-ahead for prosecutors and prison officials to plan Floyd’s execution for the week of July 26.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state now has an official spider, thanks to third graders who went from being afraid of arachnids to promoting them as symbols of the state’s strengths. Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill Friday designating the daring jumping spider as the official state spider of New Hampshire. He was joined by students at Hollis Primary School, who drafted the legislation after a weeklong unit designed to reduce fear of spiders. “I started out with a class yelling, ‘Ewwww,’ and by the end of the week … they were literally waiting in line to hold a little black spider with their bare hands,” teacher Tara Happy told a state House committee in January. Students researched various spiders before settling on the daring jumping spider – formal name Phidippus audax. They emphasized the fuzzy, quarter-sized spider’s winter hardiness, described it as “cute and colorful like New Hampshire’s trees in autumn,” and evoked the state’s “Live Free or Die” motto in recounting how the spiders create “parachutes” to fly to new homes. New Hampshire adopted the white potato as the state’s official vegetable in 2013 at the request of Derry Village Elementary School students. Over the years, similar efforts have led to the adoption of other symbols, including a state poultry (the New Hampshire Red) and state fruit (pumpkin).\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will carry a $10.1 billion surplus – about 25% of the total budget – into the new fiscal year that starts July 1, in a stark turnaround from last year, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy sought to borrow almost $10 billion because of a revenue downturn. The $10.1 billion figure is nearly $4 billion higher than the Murphy administration had forecast earlier this year. “Thanks to a remarkable two-month revenue collection surge – an April and May ‘surprise’ like no other – state tax collections in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) are hitting historic highs,” State Treasurer Elizabeth Muoio told lawmakers. The surge in revenue comes just as lawmakers and Murphy face a June 30 deadline to enact a balanced budget. The extra cash confronts lawmakers and the governor with a tantalizing question in an election year: How should they spend the money? The governor will “invest in our public education system, reduce the burden of health care costs, and provide additional tax cuts to New Jersey’s growing middle class,” Murphy’s spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said in an email. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Paul Sarlo said he wants to use the funds to pay down state debt, increase the state’s payment for the public pension and make longer-term investments.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum have announced plans to build a facility large enough to fill an entire city block. The new 54,000-square-foot museum will be built on the site of a former Safeway grocery store, which is currently occupied by the museum’s Education Center and Prima Title, The Santa Fe New Mexican reports. It is estimated to cost $60 million. The expansion project has been in the works since the museum opened in 1997, but the expansion evolved into relocation in recent years. Museum Director Cody Hartley said the existing museum will become an annex, but officials could later decide not to use the current building. “The organization has grown and grown and grown, and our facility has not kept up,” he said. “This future building will sustain us for years.” Hartley said he hopes to pull demolition permits by the end of the year, with design work taking up most of 2022. Construction is expected to begin shortly after, with a possible opening date in 2024. The museum opened in 1997 with 40 O’Keeffe paintings. It obtained additional paintings in 2006 from the Georgia O’Keeffe Foundation. “This little museum had to prove itself so that museums could trust us with their works,” said Hartley, who joined the museum in 2013 and became its director in 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state cannot require internet providers to offer broadband service for low-income customers for as little as $15 a month starting this week, a federal judge ruled Friday. The low-income broadband consumers law passed in the state budget in April, which was supposed to come into effect Tuesday. It allowed the state’s attorney general to issue penalties up to $1,000 per violation from providers. USTelecom, CTIA, the New York State Telecommunications Association and other industry groups representing internet providers had sued in April, arguing that the law meant they could either face penalties for not complying or be forced to provide the services “at a loss.” U.S. District Court Senior District Judge Denis R. Hurley, of the Eastern District of New York, said in a preliminary injunction that “the internet’s promise of access” hinges on whether people can afford it. But the judge said the internet providers have shown that they could suffer “imminent irreparable injury” because of the law’s potential impact on their bottom line. Three of the internet companies told the court that the law would reduce annual net income by at least $1 million each. “While a telecommunications giant like Verizon may be able to absorb such a loss, others may not,” the judge wrote.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The constitutional right of children to have access to a good public school education also applies to individual students who aren’t getting help to stop classroom bullying and harassment against them, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. The justices’ unanimous ruling in part addresses the declaration in a landmark 1997 ruling by the court that the combination of two portions of the state constitution guarantees every child of this state an “opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools.” That and another 2004 ruling in what’s known as the “Leandro” case created the basis for a separate public policy debate over how to address inequitable school funding and services not considered in Friday’s opinion. But the right to that opportunity also must be offered as grounds for reasonable legal claims by individual students who say that their rights were violated and that there is no other way to seek redress, Chief Justice Paul Newby wrote. “The right to a sound basic education rings hollow if the structural right exists but in a setting that is so intimidating and threatening to students that they lack a meaningful opportunity to learn,” Newby said in the opinion, which reverses a ruling by the state Court of Appeals to dismiss the case.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican legislative leaders are in no hurry to spend an additional $1 billion in federal coronavirus aid, despite grumbling from some lawmakers that the funds should be distributed sooner rather than later. Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and Ray Holmberg, who heads the powerful Senate appropriations committee, say they’re awaiting federal guidance on how the money can be used. The federal funds were transferred to the state-owned Bank of North Dakota this month and represent the single-largest deposit into state coffers in history, state Treasurer Thomas Beadle said. Other massive deposits, including the previous appropriation of $1.25 billion in coronavirus aid last year, were made in increments, Beadle said. The latest deposit is parked in short-term CDs, earning less than 1% interest, he said. North Dakota’s share of the federal funds is part of a pandemic relief package signed by President Joe Biden that includes $350 billion for state and local governments. Around the Capitol, some members of the GOP-led Legislature jokingly refer to the aid as “Biden Bucks.” Some lawmakers have been pushing to identify projects and begin doling the money out, Wardner said. “I don’t know why there is such a hurry,” he said. “How can we spend it when we’re not sure what the rules are?”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The City Council on Monday is expected to vote on legislation that would pay residents $100 each for getting their COVID-19 vaccines, an incentive that members hope will spur more to get the jab. Only those who receive their vaccines after Monday will be eligible, and they must be Columbus residents. There are no income restrictions, but only $275,000 is available for payments, which means a total of 2,750 people will be able to get the money. Council President Pro-Tem Elizabeth Brown said the Vaccine Green program is an extension of the Right to Recover program the City Council adopted in 2020. In that program, approved in October, the council approved $1.21 million in federal coronavirus relief for low-wage workers who needed to take time off to recover from COVID-19. Many low-wage workers don’t receive sick pay. Through March, more than 80% of the recipients were people of color, Brown said. That program was administered by the Columbus Urban League and Catholic Social Services, and the vaccine incentive program will also be administered by the Urban League, Brown said. A website will go live for residents to register once City Council approves the legislation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission announced Thursday that it is expanding the eligibility for cash incentives to those who leave unemployment rolls and return to work. Anyone working two part-time jobs totaling 32 or more hours per week will qualify for the $1,200 stipend, the OESC said. The incentive announced in May by Gov. Kevin Stitt was to be available only to those working full time for 32 or more hours weekly. The OESC is offering virtual job fairs through the end of June and will host in-person job fairs in Tulsa on June 23 and Oklahoma City on June 25, according to Director Shelley Zumwalt. “The agency is continuing to focus on providing benefits to those in need, while also focusing on connecting job-seekers with employment opportunities through our reemployment services and upcoming career fairs,” Zumwalt said. Stitt announced the program last month, along with a June 26 end to $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefits to push workers back to employers who have said that some jobless workers were paid more in benefits than they would have received in wages.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As the state nears its vaccination target to reopen the economy, Gov. Kate Brown announced Friday that she is extending the state’s mortgage foreclosure moratorium through September. However, the governor was unable to extend the state’s eviction moratorium, which began in April 2020 as tenants financially struggled during the pandemic. That is set to expire at the end of June. “This means that renters must pay their July rent, or their landlords can evict them for nonpayment,” Brown said. Last month, the Democratic governor signed a bill that reinstated Oregon’s moratorium on foreclosures, which allow homeowners to put their mortgage in forbearance at least through June 30. The law also gave Brown the authority to extend the end date, which she announced she was doing Friday. “This is vital protection that the Legislature has provided to Oregon’s homeowners as we continue to rebound from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” Brown said. However, the governor was unable to extend state’s rent moratorium. Brown urged those who will struggle to pay rent in July apply for rental assistance. Brown is working with lawmakers to pass a bill that would give tenants who apply for rental assistance “safe harbor from eviction.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday signed legislation to extend hundreds of waivers of regulations that his administration approved over the past 15 months under the authority of his pandemic disaster emergency declaration that lawmakers voted to end. The bill allows the waivers to last through Sept. 30, unless Wolf’s administration ends them sooner. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the bill unanimously, at Wolf’s urging, as a companion to the Republican-penned resolution to end the disaster emergency declaration that passed nearly along partisan lines. Republicans characterized their move to end the declaration as carrying out the will of the people in last month’s statewide referendum, in which voters approved a GOP-backed constitutional amendment to give lawmakers broad new power over extending and ending disaster emergencies. The suspended regulations cover a wide swath of government requirements, including licensing, inspections and training. The Wolf administration maintains that dissolving the disaster emergency does not affect a health secretary’s disease-prevention authority to issue mask-wearing and stay-at-home orders or to shut down schools and nonessential businesses. Wolf, in any case, has ended those measures as vaccinations rise.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are being encouraged to get out and go for a walk. The RIWalks Challenge, coordinated by the Rhode Island Land Trust, is designed to entice people to get outside and explore nature while enjoying land trust trails, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve health. Thirty different woodland “creatures” have been installed on trails around the state. The creatures are inspired by the plant life found in nature, the trust announced in a statement. Each has a QR code to snap to get more information about the creature. Executive Director Rupert Friday said he hopes people share a photo on social media and inspire others. A newly designed website, riwalks.org/challenge.php, will help walkers track the creatures they find. “Our goal in the design was to elicit a sense of wonder, surprise, and mystery,” Greg Rebis, who designed the creatures, said in a statement. “The resulting designs are whimsical characters – an anthropomorphization that dances between fantasy and reality – to appeal to the imagination and let people relate to our native flora while out in nature.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster’s decision to end the COVID-19 state of emergency in South Carolina means it’s back to being illegal to buy beer or wine outside a store. During the pandemic, McMaster’s emergency order allowed grocery and other stores to deliver beer and wine to people picking up their purchases in a parking lot or a drive-thru window. Lawmakers tried to pass bills changing the law permanently, but proposals couldn’t get through both the House and Senate this session. So when McMaster let his final of 30 state-of-emergency declarations expire June 6, curbside beer and wine delivery went with it. But the ban may just last a few weeks. The House put into its budget plan a temporary renewal so that people would not have to go inside a store to get beer and wine. If a conference committee agrees, then curbside delivery could return when the new budget begins July 1.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBaltic: The next mayor could be decided by the drawing of lots after an election officially ended in a tie. Election officials from the southeastern South Dakota city, which has a population of just over 1,000, said their canvas of votes Thursday confirmed that the two mayoral candidates – Deborah McIsaac and Tracy Peterson – were tied with 117 votes apiece. The Dell Rapids Tribune reports that if the election remains tied after a potential recount, state law calls for the election to be decided by “a drawing of lots.” The candidates have until the end of the day Thursday to initiate a recount. But if they don’t request the recount or if the vote count remains tied, City Administrator Rebecca Wulf would then meet with the candidates to decide the election in a game of chance. “It’s pretty incredible,” Wulf said. “When they flipped the last vote over, and it was a tie, I just sat on the ground and said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me.’ ”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations voted Wednesday to begin a comprehensive study of litter pollution in the state. The Tennessee Wildlife Federation, which advocated for the study, said in a news release that $15 million in taxpayer money is spent to clean up litter each year. In spite of that effort, the Tennessee River contains more microplastics per gallon than any other studied river in the world, according to the group. Other impacts to the economy include negative tourist perception and $60 million a year in agricultural damage, according to the group. The new study will include the sources and composition of litter, financial and environmental costs, and the economic opportunities of recovering waste. “If we want to see reductions in litter pollution, we need a comprehensive and statewide approach,” Wildlife Federation CEO Michael Butler said in a news release. “Our water, wildlife and wild places are drowning in litter.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has offered no details on his plans to construct new barriers along the border with Mexico while also launching an aggressive campaign to arrest migrants – moves that set up another clash with the Biden administration over immigration. Abbott did not say how much new barrier Texas would erect, where it would be installed along the state’s 1,200 miles of international border or what it would look like when he made the announcement Thursday in a room full of sheriffs in the border city of Del Rio. He promised more would be revealed this week. A top official in one of Texas’ largest border counties, Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez, said Friday that he sees the goal as putting in place new barriers that would give state troopers grounds to arrest migrants who go around or damage it – and then put them in jail for six months. “I understand why he wants to do it. It’s a tool that gets him to a Class B misdemeanor,” Cortez said. He was skeptical of whether jail would deter migrants who travel hundreds of miles and risk death to get to the U.S. Legal experts said the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the power to enforce immigration law is in the hands of the federal government, including striking down efforts by Arizona Republicans a decade ago.\n\nUtah\n\nBryce Canyon National Park: Dozens gathered to look up at the stars rather than down to the hoodoos in recent days at the park’s annual astronomy festival. For more than 50 years, Bryce Canyon has held ranger-led astronomy programs, though the park only gained its International Dark Sky designation in 2019. This year’s celebration was the first Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival held since the designation, as last year’s event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also marked a return to large events after the pandemic for all Utah national parks, though Bryce Canyon has held some events with COVID-19 restrictions through the past year. “There’s no place quite like Bryce Canyon by day, and no time like a new moon in June to enjoy it by night,” a press release said. Day programs included family-friendly arts and crafts with opportunities to make sundials and paper constellations and to contribute artwork unveiled Saturday. At twilight, park rangers held presentations at the Sunrise Point Amphitheater exploring space, covering everything from planets to black holes to birds. “We want to, for what we are doing here at this park, encourage stewardship of our night skies,” Ranger Ben Taylor said in his evening program entitled “Looking Back at Bryce, Looking Back at Home.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is seeing a large infestation of gypsy moth caterpillars this year that are defoliating trees, the Agency of Agriculture said. Vermont has not seen a large outbreak since 1991, but the insects have been present in smaller numbers. Gypsy moths are invasive insects that first arrived in the United States more than 100 years ago, and they have been expanding their range ever since. The moths prefer oak trees, but when populations are high, they will eat many types of leaves, including maple and pine. Although gypsy moth caterpillars are damaging, otherwise healthy trees can often survive a few years of successive defoliation. At the time of the last major outbreak, a fungus significantly decreased the gypsy moth population. The fungus is most abundant after periods of wet weather, but due to the droughts and dry weather the state has experienced over the past few years, the fungus has been limited. Due to this combination of drought and defoliation, Vermont may see another year or two of high levels of gypsy moth activity unless the state sees some rainy seasons to increase the population of the gypsy moth-killing fungus.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Singer Pharrell Williams’ nonprofit plans to open a group of small private schools for students from low-income families, starting in Norfolk. The first school will open this fall in the Ghent neighborhood for students in the city in grades three through five, with the goal of expanding on the equity-focused nonprofit’s decade of experience running summer programs for students, The Virginian-Pilot reports. “If the system is fixed and unfair, then it needs to be broken,” Williams said in a news release. “We don’t want lockstep learning where so many kids fall behind; we want bespoke learning designed for each child, where the things that make a child different are the same things that will make a child rise up and take flight.” Called Yellowhab, yellow after Williams’ nonprofit and “hab” after the name of the Mars habitat in the movie “The Martian,” the school will be tuition-free for at least the first year. The costs of attendance will be covered by philanthropic support. Williams’ nonprofit has offered summer programs and other educational opportunities throughout Hampton Roads for years but settled on Norfolk for the site of the first school because of its deeply entrenched housing segregation and the city’s plans to redevelop three public housing communities through its billion-dollar St. Paul’s redevelopment.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Gonzaga University is joining the list of schools that will require students to prove they are vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to participate in campus activities this fall. Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh made the announcement Thursday in a message to the university community, The Spokesman-Review reports. The requirement includes students in programs split between in-person and online activities but not those in graduate programs offered exclusively online. Exemptions will be permitted for medical and religious reasons. As far as personal or philosophical objections, McCulloh said the university “cannot determine how those would be evaluated, and so (we) are not including them.” McCulloh said he expects the university’s COVID-19 vaccination reporting website to be online later this month. Gonzaga is only requiring staff to attest whether they are vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, McCulloh said, with the policy based on a directive from the state Department of Labor and Industries. “The virus is a known hazard,” he said. “Our obligation is to do everything we can to keep people safe.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Greenbrier River Trail has been designated as a national recreation trail, federal officials said. The trail adds more 78 miles to the National Trails System, a network of more than 1,300 existing trails across the U.S., a statement from the Interior Department said. “As COVID-19 vaccination rates increase and our nation takes a collective and cautious sigh of relief, we need recreational resources now more than ever to strengthen physical, social and mental health across our country,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said. The Greenbrier River Trail is a former railroad that’s now used for hiking, biking and horseback riding. The longest trail of its kind in West Virginia, it goes through several small towns and some of the state’s most remote areas, and it includes 35 bridges and two tunnels. “The addition of the Greenbrier River Trail to our National Trails System is fantastic news for our entire state,” U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-Va., said in a statement. “These and all of the other magnificent parks and trails within our borders truly connect our communities and create endless opportunities for both residents and visitors alike while also contributing to local economies.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that local health departments do not have the authority to close schools due to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic, delivering a win to private and religious schools that challenged a Dane County order. The conservative majority of the court, in a 4-3 decision, also ruled that a school closure order issued last year by Public Health Madison & Dane County infringed on constitutional religious rights. The ruling is another victory for conservatives who challenged state and local orders issued during the pandemic to close businesses and schools; limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other buildings; and require masks to be worn. All of those restrictions have either expired or been rescinded by courts. Friday’s ruling will have no immediate impact because the 2020-21 school year has ended, but it will limit the powers of health departments in the future by preventing them from ordering school closures. Dane County Health Director Janel Heinrich said the ruling “hinders the ability of local health officers in Wisconsin to prevent and contain public health threats for decades to come.”\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park recorded its busiest May ever as tourism continued to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. The park had more than 483,000 recreational visits last month, up 11% from May 2019, park officials said Friday. So far, Yellowstone is seeing its busiest year in recent memory. The park recorded more than 658,000 visits from January through May, the most since 594,000 visits during that time in 2016. Usually the park opens to vehicles between mid-April and mid-May, but last year ir was closed from late March through most of May because of the pandemic. The park’s two Wyoming entrances opened for the summer season May 18, and its three Montana entrances opened June 1. Tourism rebounded, and the park posted its second-busiest August and busiest September and October on record. The park finished 2020 with 3.8 million recreational visits, down 5% from 2019.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/19/pandemic-memes-giant-rubber-ducky-tattoo-boom-news-around-states/118449546/", "title": "Pandemic memes, giant rubber ducky: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A major state employer, the University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System, said Tuesday that it would require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as communities large and small canceled events and as more schools ordered face masks to confront the worsening surge of the coronavirus. The city of Montgomery announced Monday that band shows and other events connected with back-to-back football games planned next month between historically Black colleges were being called off because of the pandemic. Mule Day, the biggest annual event in the 4,500-person town of Winfield, also was called off for the second year straight because of rising cases of COVID-19 in northwest Alabama. In Cullman, where the Rock the South country music festival held last week drew thousands, health officials were concerned about a rise in COVID-19 cases linked to the gathering. Judy Smith, area administrator of the state health department, said 41% of recent COVID-19 cases were in people between the ages of 21 and 49. “That’s probably the majority of what went to Rock the South,” she told the Decatur Daily. Other large events are pushing ahead. The National Shrimp Festival, which can attract as many as 250,000 people to Gulf Shores, remains scheduled for October, a city spokesperson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A ship that sank off Kodiak Island more than three decades ago has started to leak diesel fuel, and a state official suspects ground shaking from last month’s massive magnitude 8.2 earthquake might be the reason. The vessel sank in 1989 in Womens Bay, “and it’s been resting there since,” Jade Gamble, the state’s on-scene spill coordinator, told CoastAlaska. The first reports of an oil sheen came in a week after the July 28 earthquake, the largest in the U.S. in the past half-century. It’s not clear how much diesel fuel or other contaminants remain on the Saint Patrick. The 138-foot former scallop boat was hit by a rogue wave in November 1981 near Marmot Island. The crew of 12 abandoned ship; only two survived. The vessel eventually was towed to Womens Bay, where it later sank. “They’ve been able to minimize the leak,” Gamble said. “Our main goal is to ensure we don’t have some type of catastrophic release.” An official at the Alaska Earthquake Center said it’s not clear if the quake is responsible for the ship’s leak, however. The epicenter was about 260 miles southwest of Womens Bay. Despite its size, the quake didn’t cause serious damage or produce a major tsunami.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Conservative groups and Republican lawmakers said Tuesday that they will ask voters to approve an ID requirement for mail-in ballots, potentially creating a significant new voting requirement in a crucial battleground state. The measure is the latest GOP effort to impose new restrictions following Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of fraud. “There’s a confidence crisis among many people,” said Republican Sen. J.D. Mesnard, one of the lawmakers supporting the initiative. “How it came to be is somewhat immaterial to the fact that it exists and, by virtue of it existing, is a threat to democracy.” Nearly 90% of Arizona voters cast ballots they receive in the mail. Voting-rights advocates say imposing new requirements on those citizens is inevitably going to lead some votes to be left uncounted. The proposed initiative is backed by influential and deep-pocketed groups, including the Free Enterprise Club and Heritage Action. Doubts about the integrity of the election are fueled by groups on the right pushing conspiracy theories about what happened in 2020, said Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director for All Voting is Local, a voting-rights group. “Its beyond nonsensical that you create a problem and then you now have to create a solution to the problem you created,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Department of Health on Tuesday reported 41 more COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 6,539. Arkansas’ COVID-19 hospitalizations decreased by 49 to 1,410, a day after the state reached a new record for people in the hospital due to the coronavirus. The state reported 2,203 new virus cases, bringing its total to 422,866. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have skyrocketed in recent weeks because of the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. There are only 17 intensive care unit beds available in the state, the department said. There are 542 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state and 328 on ventilators. Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted Tuesday that COVID patients make up about 47% of the state’s adult ICU beds. Nearly 39% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The department reported more than 12,000 doses of vaccine were given Monday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County on Tuesday ordered people to wear masks at all outdoor mass events such as concerts and sports games, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The county health officer mandated masks at all times for any event with a crowd greater than 10,000 except when people are actively eating and drinking. The order will take effect at 11:59 p.m. Thursday. SoFi Stadium announced it would implement the new mask mandate at L.A. Rams and Chargers games this weekend. Other sports venues were expected to follow suit. The county previously required masks to be worn in most indoor public places, such as restaurants and gyms. The revised order now also covers “mega events” ranging from marathons to car shows and food festivals. Delta, a much more contagious variant of the coronavirus, is fueling a surge of new cases across the country. California is averaging about 10,000 new infections a day. LA County, which has 10 million residents, on Tuesday announced nearly 3,000 new cases of COVID-19, with about 1,700 people hospitalized. There also were 30 new deaths reported. Most of those infections are among the unvaccinated, authorities said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis on Tuesday rescinded a 19th-century proclamation that called for citizens to kill Native Americans and take their property, in what he hopes can begin to make amends for “sins of the past.” The 1864 order by Colorado’s second territorial governor, John Evans, would eventually lead to the Sand Creek massacre, one of Colorado’s darkest and most fraught historic moments. The brutal assault left more than 200 Arapaho and Cheyenne people – mostly women, children and elderly – dead. Evans’ proclamation was never lawful because it established treaty rights and federal Indian law, Polis said at the signing of his executive order on the Capitol steps. “It also directly contradicted the Colorado Constitution, the United States Constitution and Colorado criminal codes at the time,” the Democratic governor said to whoops from the crowd. Polis stood alongside citizens of the Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, many dressed in traditional regalia. Some held signs reading “Recognize Indigenous knowledge, people, land” and “Decolonize to survive.” Evans governed the territory of Colorado during three years of the Civil War, from 1862 to 1865. He resigned after the Sand Creek massacre happened under his order.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The earthquake that killed hundreds of people in Haiti on Saturday has had an unforeseen emotional effect on a local parish and the Rev. Dukens Boliere. Boliere is the pastor of Shekinah Free Methodist Worship Center in Bridgeport. He also oversees a sister parish with the same name in Corail, Haiti, that was destroyed by the 7.2 magnitude quake over the weekend, the New Haven Register reports. Boliere said one member of the parish was killed, and the church caretaker is in critical condition after his house, located next to the church, collapsed on him. “The church is completely destroyed,” Boliere said. “We will be in the rebuilding mode after we assess the situation.” Corail is in a remote, mountainous area in the country’s southern peninsula, making it difficult to contact the church even in the best of times, according to the newspaper. The Bridgeport parish will hold a meeting Sunday, “gather some money and send some survival kits,” Boliere said. “It’s going to be an endeavor, but we are determined that we are going to help them as much as we can,” he said. “It’s going to be very difficult. We are going to need logistical help from Haiti to get it to them.”\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: A small downtown church is one of the first in the state to disaffiliate from the United Methodist Church in defense of LGTBQ rights and same-sex marriage. Historic Groome Church, formerly known as Groome United Methodist Church, announced its disaffiliation this month. Groome’s pastor, the Rev. S. Willard Crossan III, said the United Methodist Church has wrestled with these issues for a half-century and has “repeatedly failed to come to a meaningful resolution.” “The LGBTQ community is an important and vital part of the greater Lewes/Rehoboth community in which we live, its members are part of our daily life,” Crossan said in a news release. “They are our friends, neighbors, family members, the people we worship with, choose to love, to marry, to do business and play sports with. ... How can we reconcile the posture of the denomination with our conscience, the calling of our congregation, our ministry and the commandment of love we believe to be the heart of the Gospel?” he said. “We can’t.” Groome’s exit was finalized in a disaffiliation agreement negotiated over a two-year period with the Peninsula-Delaware Conference, which includes churches in Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: All Metro employees will be required to get COVID-19 vaccines or upload coronavirus test results weekly to the WMATA employee portal starting Sept. 7, WUSA-TV reports. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority officials said in a statement released Tuesday that if employees choose to remain unvaccinated, they can either fill out a medical or religious accommodation form or take a weekly virus test, the expense and responsibility for which will fall on the employee. New hires with Metro will have to show proof of vaccination before starting to work at Metro, WMATA said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An oceanfront park is emerging as the leading site for a memorial to the victims of a deadly condominium building collapse, a judge said Wednesday. The city of Miami Beach recently offered a portion of the 28-acre North Beach Oceanside Park as the potential location to remember the June 24 collapse of the Champlain Towers South building, which killed 98 people. Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman said at a remote hearing Wednesday that it was unrealistic to pursue any plan for a memorial where the 12-story condo once stood, as some family members wish. That nearly 2-acre location in Surfside, he said, must be sold to compensate victims of the tragedy. At least one bidder has offered up to $120 million for the property. “It has to be used for the benefit of all the victims collectively,” Hanzman said. The park, he added, is “a remarkable and extremely valuable piece of real estate. I understand this is a beautiful site that is within walking distance.” Still, some family members of collapse victims say they would prefer a fitting memorial at the exact location. “I believe the memorial should be at Surfside, and not Miami Beach, at the site of the tragedy,” said Pablo Langenfeld, whose daughter and son-in-law died in the collapse. The park is about 100 feet from the collapse site.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The State Election Board on Wednesday took a step toward a possible eventual takeover of elections in Georgia’s most populous county under a process outlined in the state’s sweeping new voting law. The board voted unanimously Wednesday to approve a bipartisan, three-person review panel to investigate the handling of elections in Fulton County, a Democratic bastion that includes most of the city of Atlanta. The county has long been a target for Republicans. Their attacks increased after former President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that fraud in the county contributed to his narrow loss in the state. An independent monitor appointed by the State Election Board found no evidence of fraud or malfeasance. GOP lawmakers last month asked the state board to appoint the performance review panel, initiating the process that could allow the Republican-controlled state board to replace the county’s board of registration and elections with an administrator it chooses. Fulton County accounts for about 11% of the state’s electorate, and President Joe Biden won nearly 73% of votes cast there in the November election. The county is about 45.5% white, 44.5% Black and 7.6% people of Asian descent, according to U.S. census data.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Intensive care units in the state’s largest private hospital system are functioning at or near capacity this week amid an alarming surge of coronavirus cases on the islands, a hospital official said. Some ICU beds were open at The Queen’s Health Systems hospitals Tuesday, but the units were “completely full” Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The hospitals were looking at canceling elective surgeries and procedures and diverting emergency patients to other hospitals. “Queen’s is accepting patients who need emergency care for treatment such as traumas, heart attacks and strokes,” said Jason Chang, The Queen’s Health systems chief operating officer and The Queen’s Medical Center president. “We remain committed to providing care by constantly evaluating our operations to ensure our doors remain open to those in need of emergency care.” But Chang said Monday that the staff is being stretched thin. “They are tired, and there is a level of frustration when you know the COVID patient you are caring for was not vaccinated, and it was largely preventable,” he said. Chang said there is no indication that the surge in new COVID-19 patients will come to an end soon. “So in two weeks the situation actually may be worse,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Hospitals are reporting record numbers of COVID-19 patients on ventilators, public health officials have reactivated a “crisis standards of care” task force, and epidemiologists are warning that based on the current rate of spread, the state could see as many as 30,000 new cases a week by mid-October. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials made the announcements during an online news conference Tuesday afternoon. Public health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said they were “extremely alarmed” by the surge. “Hospitals are completely stressed and overwhelmed and in many cases seeking assistance,” she said. There are 65 COVID-19 patients on ventilators statewide, just over last winter’s record of 63 patients. Idaho hospitals are struggling to maintain adequate staff levels, as employees get sick or decide to find work elsewhere. Based on the current infection rate of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, hospitals could have to implement crisis standards of care in as soon as two weeks, Shaw-Tulloch said. Crisis standards are intended to help hospitals direct scarce resources to the patients most likely to survive. One northern Idaho hospital is struggling to fill 500 jobs, Shaw-Tulloch said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s southern suburbs will receive a new area code in the coming months to meet the demand for new telephone numbers. The 464 area code will overlay the 708 area code, the Illinois Commerce Commission said Monday. It will be available only when all assignable prefixes in the 708 code have been exhausted, the panel said. That’s not expected to occur until January. The 708 area code serves most of western and southern Cook County and eastern and southern Will County including Alsip, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Lansing and Oak Lawn. With an overlay, an additional area code is added to the same geographic area as the existing area code, with all current phone customers retaining the original area code. The 464 area code will be assigned to new customers requesting local phone service, cellular and paging services, and alarms, the commission said. Current 708 area customers will keep their numbers. Consumers seeking additional telephone lines will, in most cases, continue to be able to receive 708 telephone numbers, even after the 464 area code is in service, the commission said. Local calls will remain local calls.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will continue paying out an extra $300 in weekly federal unemployment payments despite a Tuesday court ruling that the Republican governor had the authority to cut off the benefit. Those payments will continue because the state must give recipients a 30-day notice that they will stop, which extends past the scheduled Sept. 6 end of the federal pandemic unemployment programs, Indiana Department of Workforce Development spokesman Scott Olson said. Gov. Eric Holcomb decided in May to withdraw Indiana from the programs effective in mid-June, but a Marion County judge ruled that Indiana law requires the state to procure all available federal unemployment benefits for residents. The state resumed making the payments in July after an Indiana Court of Appeals panel turned down the state’s request to immediately block the order. A different appeals court panel, however, overturned that judge’s decision in a 3-0 ruling released Tuesday, finding that the federal pandemic unemployment programs were intended to be temporary and differed from the already existing unemployment benefits system.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa has revised its guidance for faculty on how to handle discussions of masks and COVID-19 vaccines in the classroom this fall, walking back earlier guidelines that restricted when and how those conversations could take place. Original FAQ-style guidance for faculty was posted online Aug. 10 and removed for revision two days later. It said faculty could only make statements in the classroom related to the use of masks or vaccinations “in the context of course material discussions of health-related issues,” and faculty could not ask students or colleagues about their vaccination status. University leadership quickly met with faculty leaders after some raised issue with the guidance. The revised, far looser guidance was published Tuesday and stresses that the university strongly encourages masks and vaccinations, although neither are required. The new guidance for faculty includes a pre-written statement they can choose to include on syllabi, reinforcing that the university encourages the use of masks and vaccines. Faculty also have the option of including a personal statement outlining why they are choosing to wear a mask indoors on syllabi.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A mountain lion remembered as the best painter among all the Topeka Zoo’s animals has been euthanized. The aging male cat, Dakota, used his paws to paint, said the zoo’s animal curator, Shanna Simpson. “He loved painting and was intentional about it,” she recalled Wednesday. “He would look at the canvas and place his paw where he thought it should go. It was adorable.” Dakota also loved his keepers, eating fish and playing with balls, Simpson said. Dakota was euthanized Monday after being found to have a perforation in his gastrointestinal tract, said Jared Bednar, the zoo’s director of administration and creative. “At nearly 14 years old, Dakota lived a full life, as male mountain lions typically live to approximately 13.6 years,” Bednar said Tuesday. Dakota had lived at the Topeka Zoo since the opening in 2009 of its Kansas Carnivores exhibit, which features mountain lions and river otters in displays designed to recreate the Kansas prairie. Dakota shared his habitat with a female mountain lion, Cassy, who survives. Both had been orphaned in the wild and lived at the Denver Zoo before being transferred to Topeka, Bednar said. He said that after 10 days of declining appetite and health, Dakota stopped eating and on Monday received a computed tomography scan, which revealed air within his abdomen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Association of Health Plans will give away a free unlimited ride wristband and a $20 gift card, while supplies last, to attendees 12 and older who receive free COVID-19 vaccines at the West Wing Health Pavilion during the Kentucky State Fair. A choice of vaccines will be offered at the State Fair, which opens Thursday and runs through Aug. 29 at the Kentucky Exposition Center. In addition to the giveaway, the “Shots Across the Bluegrass Tour” campaign will offer Medicaid members an incentive offered by their health plan. The state’s vaccine dashboard shows 2,419,442 Kentuckians have received at least one dose of a vaccine. That is 54% of the state’s population and 66% of its adult population. Children 12 to 15 years old were the most recent group to become eligible to receive a vaccine. Kentucky is requiring facial coverings in state government buildings. That means that in compliance with the policy, masks will be mandated indoors at the fair but are not required outdoors. There will be 89 hand sanitizer stations added throughout the fairgrounds for this summer’s event.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAngola: For the second year in a row, the annual rodeo of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola has been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state corrections department announced the decision Wednesday. The rodeo and an accompanying arts and crafts fair had been slated for each weekend in October. The department news release said the rodeo has grown in popularity since it first started in 1965. The arena for the rodeo now can hold as many as 10,000 people. The department said it was canceling the rodeo for the health and safety of prisoners and staff as a fourth surge of COVID-19 grips the state. The release said the penitentiary staff will contact those who had already bought tickets to issue refunds.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: The sudden appearance of a giant rubber duck in a harbor is a whimsical whodunit that’s defied sleuths so far. The yellow waterfowl emblazoned with the word “joy” appeared in Belfast Harbor over the weekend, and it’s a mystery who put it there. Harbor Master Katherine Given told the Bangor Daily News that the 25-foot-tall duck doesn’t pose a navigational hazard, so there’s no rush to shoo it away. “Everybody loves it,” Given said. “I have no idea who owns it, but it kind of fits Belfast. A lot of people want to keep it here.” Judy Herman, of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, stopped to snap photos Tuesday. “It’s wonderful,” she told New England Cable News. “Who would expect to see a duck in the middle of the water here?”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city wanted to meet people where they were to provide COVID-19 vaccination information, so officials turned to social media and used memes to debunk myths. And in the past few weeks, the city’s messages have gone viral with a positive outcome, said Adam Abadir, director of communications for the Baltimore City Health Department. “We can be authentic, we can be funny, and we can reach people who we wouldn’t have been able to reach otherwise,” he said. At the beginning of the pandemic, the health department used more standard communications to get information out about COVID-19, vaccines and harm-reduction principles. After social media users reached out with questions on how to communicate safety principles with friends and family, members of the health agency were scratching their heads – until a viral moment set off the light bulb. In January, Mayor Brandon Scott garnered media attention when he told a man, “Shorty, pull your mask up, man.” Video of the incident set social media ablaze. “I remember walking around the city and hearing people say, ‘Shorty, pull your mask up,’ ” Abadir said. And when an online detractor said a keto diet full of kale salads was keeping them coronavirus-free, the department turned it into a meme, too: “Salad doesn’t cure COVID, Connor.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker on Wednesday filed a nearly $1.6 billion supplemental budget, most of which would be used to provide unemployment insurance relief for employers, which he said is critical to help businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation relies on a roughly $5 billion budget surplus based on better-than-expected tax revenues. “Thanks to careful management of the commonwealth’s tax revenues and strong economic activity, Massachusetts has an unprecedented surplus at the close of fiscal year 2021, and this legislation ensures those resources are put to work to support local economies and small businesses,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Driven by pandemic-related claims, the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, funded by a payroll tax on employers, is expected to be $4 billion in the red by the end of next year, according to state figures. The governor’s proposal to provide $1 billion to the fund would relieve employers’ future obligations. Business groups have been lobbying for the help. The supplemental budget bill would also finally implement the income tax charitable deduction first approved by voters nearly 20 years ago, helping charities and nonprofits who supported vulnerable populations through the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nRockland: An invasive bug that could threaten the Christmas tree industry has been discovered in the western part of the state. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Monday that it had confirmed the presence of the balsam woolly adelgid near Rockford in Kent County. A homeowner noticed several Fraser firs declining and contacted an arborist, who spotted the infestation and alerted the state, the agency said. It’s unclear how the bug reached Michigan or how long it’s been in the state. “Human movement is one of the most common ways non-native species spread. When traveling, remember to leave firewood at home and buy it locally at your destination,” said Rob Miller, an invasive species prevention and specialist for MDARD. The Balsam woolly adelgid has been on Michigan’s invasive species watchlist for years. The sap-sucking insect damages trees, weakening or killing them over the course of many years. The balsam woolly adelgid favors true fir trees, including balsam, Fraser and concolor (white) fir. “This invasive insect is a threat to the nearly 1.9 billion balsam fir trees in Michigan’s forests,” Miller said in a news release. “As the third largest Christmas tree-growing state in the country, Michigan produces nearly 13.5 million fir trees each year.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Pollution control and natural resources officials on Wednesday released a $700 million plan to improve the drinking water for 14 Twin Cities communities whose groundwater was contaminated due to decades­long chemical disposal by 3M Co. The long-term plan, which is expected to help 174,000 residents, aims to build or improve six water treatment plants and treat 33 municipal wells while connecting nearly 300 homes to municipal water systems and providing home filtration systems to residents with private wells to remove a persistent family of chemicals known as PFAS. “This plan protects drinking water now and into the future,” said Kirk Koudelka, assistant commissioner for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. “The result is a plan that is comprehensive, safe and sustainable, resilient, and flexible to address the growing communities’ needs and an ever-changing PFAS world.” Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances – chemicals developed by Maplewood-based 3M designed to make products resistant to heat, oil, stains, grease and water – made their way into the groundwater in the Twin Cities’ eastern metropolitan area following decades of dumping into the area’s landfills by the company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Amid the worst pandemic in a century, the state is leading the nation in increased diabetes deaths per capita, according to a just-released Diabetes Care study. “It’s a perfect storm,” said Tim Moore, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association. “We already have an unhealthy population in Mississippi because of poverty and lower access to health care, and now we have a population that’s getting very sick.” Mississippi has seen more than 7,880 deaths from COVID-19 as of Tuesday. According to the state Department of Health, diabetes was an underlying condition in 1,347 of those deaths. Researchers found that between Jan. 1 and Nov. 3 of 2020, Mississippi – which has a 14.8% adult diabetes rate that trails only West Virginia – saw diabetes deaths rise 1.43 times higher than the historical level. That is the nation’s highest. This revelation comes as Mississippi faces its fiercest battle in the COVID-19 pandemic, with the coronavirus’ delta variant causing hospitals to be flooded with people in critical condition, including “young people, expectant mothers and newborns,” Moore said. The state’s largest hospital, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has within just a week been forced to set up two field hospitals, one of them in a parking garage.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Leaders of the state’s two urban areas have a message for refugees from Afghanistan: You are welcome here. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page released a joint statement Tuesday saying they are “ready, willing, and prepared” to welcome at least 1,000 Afghanistan citizens through the Special Immigrant Visa program. “This plan is consistent with our collective goal to build a more welcoming and inclusive St. Louis region, no matter where they come from or any identity they hold,” the statement said. On Monday, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas wrote on Twitter that his city “would proudly accept refugees from Afghanistan who have served bravely by our side over the past generation.” Jones, Page and Lucas are all Democrats. Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the U.S. military is coordinating with the Taliban while accelerating the airlift of Americans and Afghan allies from the Kabul airport. The Taliban swept to power after 20 years of war against the U.S.-supported Kabul government.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Little Shell Tribal Health Department has announced that the tribe will postpone its 10th annual powwow amid the spike in COVID-19 cases. Chairman Gerald Gray said the health department, powwow committee and tribal council were involved in the decision to postpone. “We felt it was best not to take a chance with the new variant and our elders and youth,” he said in an email. “Being an indoor powwow, we felt that it could possibly turn into a super-spreader event. We believe this is the best decision to protect our communities, our families and ourselves.” The event, which was set for Aug. 27-29, would have been the tribe’s first powwow celebration since gaining federal recognition in 2019.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Labor shortages that have plagued businesses across the country have also put the squeeze on state parks, leading officials to make the unprecedented move to cut hours and services at parks across the state. Nebraska’s state parks were already short-staffed this summer, operating with only an estimated 70% of their normal workforce, state parks administrator Jim Swenson told the Lincoln Journal Star. Now, with many seasonal workers headed back to school, parks are more short-staffed than ever. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission recently released a list of hour and service reductions at many of its properties, including scaling back hours at the Family Aquatic Center and John Wayne Stables at Mahoney State Park at Ashland. Trail rides and swimming pools at Ponca and Niobrara state parks are now operating on weekends only. Opening hours for visitor centers and offices have also been cut at Wildcat Hills State Recreation Area and Nature Center, Ash Hollow State Historical Park, Fort Kearny and Lake McConaughy, among others.\n\nNevada\n\nCarlin: A monument memorializing the mining town’s first Chinese pioneers will be unveiled next month. Three years ago, the remains of 13 Chinese men were buried in the Carlin Cemetery after they were discovered in 1996 during an excavation behind a house. The dedication ceremony for the new Carlin 13 monument is planned Sept. 6 at the cemetery, followed by a visit to the Carlin Chinese Garden and museum tours, the Elko Daily Free Press reports. A local viewing also is planned of the short film “Going Home” documenting the immigrants’ journey. The bodies were exhumed and studied by archaeologists from the Nevada State Museum, U.S. Forest Service, Elko County Chapter of the Nevada Archaeological Association and anthropologists from the Smithsonian Institution. The remains were eventually moved to UNLV in Las Vegas. Research on the men was published in the 2005 book “Chinese American Death Rituals: Respecting the Ancestors.” Lijuchin “Lee” Chin, owner of Chin’s Cafe, led a campaign to bring back “the oldest citizens of Carlin” and presided over a traditional Chinese ceremony at the 2018 reburial. A year later, the Carlin 13 were recognized with a cemetery plaque in conjunction with the 150th Golden Spike Anniversary of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Justice wants nearly $1 million to continue investigating and prosecuting those accused of physically and sexually abusing children at the state’s youth detention center. The current two-year budget includes $350,000 for the cost of prosecuting crimes and defending the state against civil lawsuits, but the department estimates it will need an additional $2.7 million through June 30, 2022. Of that total, more than $950,000 would go to the Criminal Justice Bureau, mostly for the investigation into abuse allegations at the Sununu Youth Services Center, previously known as the Youth Development Center, in Manchester. “Over the last 26 months, this has evolved into a complex and multi-faceted investigation,” Attorney General John Formella wrote in a recent letter to Gov. Chris Sununu, the Executive Council and lawmakers. “This case involves a very large volume of documents, involving decades of records.” Ten men were charged in April with either sexually assaulting or acting as accomplices to the assault of more than a dozen teenagers from 1994 to 2007, while an 11th man faces charges related to a pretrial facility in Concord. More than 300 men and women have come forward with allegations involving 150 staffers from 1963 to 2018.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers continue to return to the city’s casinos this summer, even as a contagious new variant of the coronavirus continues to spread, yet it was internet gambling that set a new monthly record in July. Figures released Monday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the nine casinos collectively won $118.6 million online in July, the best month ever for a state that was an early adopter of internet betting. The previous record was $113.7 million in March of this year. July’s figure was an increase of almost 36% from July 2020, when casinos had just begun to reopen after a 31/ 2 -month virus-related shutdown. “This could show that patrons have not lost their appetite for internet gaming products even as they return to the in-person gaming experience, or that more people overall are participating in different gaming options,” said Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the gambling industry. When in-person casino gambling and sports betting revenue is included, the casinos and three horse tracks that offer sports betting won over $450 million in July, an increase of more than 70% from a year ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico has retained its title as the nation’s most heavily Hispanic state, with 47.7% of respondents to the 2020 census identifying ancestry linked to Latin America and other Spanish-speaking areas. California and Texas were neck and neck as runners up, with about 39% of residents claiming Latino or Hispanic heritage. Nearly 31% of Arizona residents describe themselves as Hispanic. In New Mexico, Latino pride runs deep within a region of the U.S. where Spanish conquerors arrived in the late 1500s and Mexico governed for decades during the 19th century. The state is currently led by its third consecutive Hispanic governor. The share of New Mexico residents who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry was 12.4%. Alaska was the most predominantly Native American state, followed by Oklahoma and then New Mexico. An earlier set of data released in April showed New Mexico’s population grew by 2.8% over the past decade, making it one of the slowest-growing states in the U.S. West, adding about 58,000 residents to a population of just over 2.1 million.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A wood stork typically seen in tropical and subtropical regions migrated to New York City but died 10 days after it was first spotted on Staten Island, apparently after eating a large piece of hardened foam, researchers said. The juvenile wood stork was first seen by bird researcher Anthony Ciancimino on July 31 in a saltwater marsh near an Amazon warehouse, the Staten Island Advance reports. Lawrence Pugliares, a nature photographer and administrator of a Staten Island wildlife Facebook group, received a call Aug. 9 from a group member who said the stork appeared to be choking, the newspaper reports. The bird died soon after Pugliares arrived to check on it. Jose Ramirez-Garofalo and Shannon Curley, two adjunct biology professors at the College of Staten Island, brought the stork to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, where a necropsy revealed a piece of insular foam more than 3 feet long in the bird’s stomach. “It was in the gut of the animal, so it presumably ate it thinking it was a prey item like an eel or a snake,” Curley told the Advance. Wood storks typically breed in Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The species was put on the federal endangered species list in 1984 but downgraded to threatened in 2014.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lawmakers on Tuesday finalized legislation to raise the minimum age to get married in the state from 14 to 16, a decision that would end the state’s status as an outlier compared to surrounding states. The Senate voted unanimously to accept House changes to the measure, which now goes to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper for his expected signature. Children who are 16 or 17 would still be required to receive parental permission or a judge’s approval to get married, and the age difference between the youth and their spouse now could be no more than four years. Current law has no minimum age gap between the spouses, and children as young as 14 can get married if they become pregnant and if a judge allows it. Parental permission has otherwise been required beginning at 16. House and Senate legislators joined women’s rights advocates and child protection groups this year to raise the marriage age. They had tried to raise it to 18 with no exceptions, but some lawmakers remained comfortable keeping certain marriages involving a child or two youths as an option. Still, marriage reform advocates and Cooper were pleased with the agreed-to higher threshold.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Active cases of COVID-19 soared above 1,000 for the first time since spring, state health officials reported Tuesday. The state’s coronavirus dashboard showed 267 new coronavirus cases. The Bismarck Tribune reports it’s the highest daily total since 303 cases on Jan. 8. Active cases statewide rose to 1,101, up 112 from Monday and more than double the total just two weeks ago. Cases are spiking nationwide due primarily to the highly contagious and fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus. Health officials also confirmed three more virus-related deaths Tuesday, raising North Dakota’s pandemic death toll to 1,548. Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, North Dakota has had 113,673 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 111,024 recoveries and 4,487 hospitalizations. Forty-four COVID-19 patients remained in hospitals Tuesday, down three from Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine strongly urged Tuesday that schoolchildren continue wearing masks in school at least for the beginning of the academic year to avert more drastic coronavirus measures, such as quarantines or a return to online learning. DeWine said the state doesn’t have experience with children in classes without masks, and kids can’t afford another year without in-person schooling. “The best way to make sure a child can stay in school and not have his or her classes interrupted is for that child to be vaccinated,” DeWine said during a news conference. “If that child cannot be vaccinated, the best way to ensure a good school year for that child is for that child to wear a mask while in class. ... Or having everybody in class wear a mask, that’s how we slow this down. That’s how we keep kids in the classroom.” The Republican governor noted that the 3,235 coronavirus cases reported Tuesday, along with 1,571 hospitalizations, were the most since February. School mask mandates vary widely across Ohio. But Columbus, the largest district with about 50,000 students, is requiring them, as are Cincinnati and Cleveland schools, at least for the beginning of the year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Indian gaming industry paid $167million in exclusivity fees to the state last fiscal year, a record amount that signals the industry’s rebound. The coronavirus pandemic prompted all of Oklahoma’s tribally operated casinos to shutter within days of each other in March 2020. Most remained closed for two months or longer. The shutdown cut off a key revenue source for tribal governments, as well as the state. One year later, business is back, according to executives gathered Tuesday for the annual Indian gaming conference in Oklahoma City. State revenues from gaming increased more than 35% between the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, which end in June, according to figures provided by Matthew Morgan, who chairs the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association. The growth reflects pent-up demand and limited options to get out elsewhere, said Jessica Feil, vice president of the American Gaming Association. Operators now are grappling with how to maintain the success and continue to expand. Morgan credited a unified pandemic response among tribal leaders as the reason most casinos were able to reopen by the end of June 2020. The group put together safety recommendations, such as requiring face masks, that can be adjusted in response to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nOregon\n\nSeaside: Scores of live sand dollars began washing ashore on the Oregon coast Sunday, mystifying locals. The Seaside Aquarium posted photos of the sand dollars to Facebook, reporting that thousands washed up with the afternoon high tides on the south end of Seaside Beach, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. “At this time, we do not know what has caused this, and these types of incidents usually have several contributing factors,” the aquarium wrote on Facebook. The post received hundreds of comments, many from concerned people who urged locals to rush out and throw the creatures back into the water. However, sand dollars can only live a few minutes out of the ocean, the aquarium said. Sand dollars are a species of sea urchin covered in tube feet and spines that they use to move and eat. In rough waters they lie flat partially buried in the sand, but in calmer waters they stand upright like wheels. The creatures feed on algae and other small bits of organic material.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has ruled that a statue of Christopher Columbus can remain in south Philadelphia, reversing the city’s decision to remove it after the explorer became a focus of protesters amid nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice. Common Pleas Court Judge Paula Patrick said last year’s decision to remove the now-boarded-up statue from Marconi Plaza was unsupported by law and based on insufficient evidence. “It is baffling to this court as to how the city of Philadelphia wants to remove the statue without any legal basis. The city’s entire argument and case is devoid of any legal foundation,” Patrick wrote. The ruling Tuesday overturns a decision in September by a city licensing board that upheld a July 2020 decision by the city historical commission to remove the 144-year-old statue. The judge wrote that the city failed to provide an adequate opportunity for public input about its future. A city representative expressed disappointment and said officials were exploring all options “including a possible appeal.” Attorney George Bochetto, who represents the Friends of Marconi Plaza, said the plaintiffs were “ecstatic.” He said he would immediately seek an order to remove a wooden box constructed by city crews around the statue after clashes between protesters and residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s education council has voted to reject any district’s back-to-school plans that don’t include mask mandates, essentially requiring face coverings for all K-12 students this fall, despite being told by a state Education Department lawyer that it did not have the authority to do so. After the Rhode Island Council on Elementary and Secondary Education made its unanimous decision during a meeting Tuesday night, Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green said she will follow the directive, WPRI-TV reports. “They’re my bosses; yes, I have to follow the council’s direction,” she said. “Basically, what was said tonight is we will take our chances with any lawsuits that may happen.” The decision comes as the delta variant is being blamed for another wave of coronavirus cases across the state. Department of Education lawyer Anthony Cottone told the council before the vote that it does not have the authority to mandate masks in school districts statewide. Only the Legislature by statute or the governor through executive order can do so, he said. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee has recommended masks for schoolchildren but has resisted issuing a mask mandate, saying the issue should be left up to school districts, many of which have already issued mask requirements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Anyone with a permit to carry a concealed weapon in the state no longer has to keep their weapon hidden under clothing. Gov. Henry McMaster held a ceremonial signing last week for a new state law allowing people to carry pistols in the open. The law still requires a permit obtained in a training class to carry a pistol in public, but it eliminates the need to keep a holster hidden under a pant leg or jacket. The legislation passed this spring also eliminates a $50 permit fee to get a concealed weapons permit and lowers the number of bullets that someone must fire at a target in an accuracy test to get a permit from 50 to 25 shots. Requirements remain that a permit holder be 21 or over, take eight hours of training and pass a background check that includes fingerprinting. “This is a good day for South Carolina. It is a happy day for law-abiding citizens,” McMaster said Friday at the Palmetto State Armory in Greenville, joined by Second Amendment advocates. The South Carolina House this year passed a bill allowing anyone who can legally own a gun to carry one openly. That proposal is now in the Senate. The law was opposed by State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel as well as police chiefs and sheriffs in some of the state’s largest population centers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Tattoo shops are booming, with waits up to six months long for an appointment, as the economic reopening has customers looking to get the ink they’ve delayed. On the most recent Friday the 13th – traditionally a busy day for tattoo studios, as they draw walk-in clients seeking a quick “flash” tattoo preset design that’s on sale – Siouxperior Ink was busy filling walk-ins and completing hours­long work for clients who had booked appointments months ahead of time. It was a stark contrast to the lack of traffic the shop had in its scheduling book last year. During the slow pandemic months, owner and tattoo artist Andrew Thomas created extra Halloween masks, and artist Mike Adaver painted metal striping on cars for side income. “A lot of people, they would cancel appointments because it’s like, ‘Now I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m laid off from work,’ ” Thomas said. “It’s like, ‘Hey we understand. It was rough on everybody.’ ” Now the shop is booked, a sentiment echoed across Sioux Falls as many tattoo studios have seen a rush of people booking appointments into the end of the year. Some studios have even closed their books to new clients.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials say five counties will no longer require emissions testing of vehicles early next year under new federal approval, though the capital city area won’t be among them. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation said the Environmental Protection Agency has approved a revision to the state’s air quality plan that allows for Hamilton, Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson and Wilson counties to eliminate their testing. The requirement will end Jan. 14, 2022. Nashville-Davidson County is forging ahead under a state law that offers an option for local agencies with their own air pollution control program to continue vehicle emission testing. The Republican-supermajority General Assembly passed legislation in 2018 to seek federal approval to eliminate vehicle emissions testing.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: As COVID-19 cases rise, businesses could be at risk of being punished by the state if they try to require customers to show proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. In its recent regular session, the Legislature passed a measure that prohibits businesses from requiring proof of immunization. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which regulates alcohol sales, posted on its website this week that it may require compliance with the law as a condition of holding a liquor license or other authorization. The agency said it has not taken action against any businesses to date but has requested to meet with business operators where “potential noncompliance could be taking place.” The agency’s statement came after Austin restaurants Launderette and Fresa’s, which share the same ownership group, announced earlier in the week that they would require anyone dining indoors at their restaurants to provide proof of at least a first round of vaccinations against COVID-19. The restaurants’ social media posts said indoor diners would have to wear masks when not seated at a table, though outdoor diners would not need proof of vaccination, nor would they have to wear masks.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: After a tumultuous year of limited in-person performances, the Utah Symphony has reemerged with the “Forever Mighty” Tour, visiting many of the state’s national parks and landscapes and ending Saturday in Hurricane with hundreds of attendees despite the threat of harsh rains. The symphony previously held the “Mighty 5 Tour” in 2014 and the “Great American Road Trip Tour” in 2017, both with performances in similar settings. This year’s tour aimed to promote responsible recreation amid record visitation and celebrating togetherness after more than a year of limited live entertainment, organizers said. “We have exceptional performers and musicians in Utah, and it’s important for everyone to have the opportunity to experience them live and in-person,” Jill Remington Love, executive director of the Utah Department of Cultural and Community Engagement, said in a May press release. With heavy cloud cover as nearby St. George was hit with monsoon rains Saturday night, hundreds gathered on lawn chairs, blankets or reserved white chairs in the grassy area 25 miles from Zion National Park. Before Hurricane, the tour traveled 500 miles through rural communities, stopping in Cache Valley on Tuesday, Helper on Wednesday, Bryce Canyon National Park on Thursday and Kanab’s Angels Landing on Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Environmental groups allege in a lawsuit that a state agency has failed to protect endangered bats when spraying pesticides to deter mosquitoes. The Vermont Natural Resources Council and Center for Biological Diversity accused the Agency of Natural Resources of endangering five bat species while spraying for bugs – a claim one official said has no legal or scientific merit. “If our scientists had credible scientific evidence that the mosquito control district insecticide use was having an impact on the bat population, we would certainly take action,” said Louis Porter, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. The Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, little brown bat, eastern small-footed bat and tricolored bat are protected by Vermont’s Protection of Endangered Species Act. Mason Overstreet, an attorney at Vermont Law School’s Environmental Advocacy Clinic, said in a statement that “poorly regulated pesticide spraying is putting the state’s threatened and endangered bats at risk.” The environmental groups said the spraying is done at night when bats are hunting for insects. The bats are exposed to the toxins when they inhale or eat insects that have been sprayed. Porter said the state has “done as much or more as any state in the country to protect and restore threatened and endangered bats.”\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: The U.S. Treasury Department is releasing a shipment of tiles that were intended for a northern Virginia mosque but were confiscated at Dulles International Airport after they were determined to have violated sanctions on Iran. Word of the release came through the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which released a letter dated Aug. 16 from the Treasury Department to attorneys representing the Manassas Mosque. “We welcome this decision as a reaffirmation of our nation’s respect for religious freedom and diversity. Americans of all religious backgrounds should have access to the symbols of their faith, whatever the origin of those symbols,” CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said in a news release. The 750 pounds of tiles were a gift from a mosque in the Iranian city of Qom to the Virginia mosque and include verses from the Quran. Imam Abolfazl Nahidian said the custom-made tiles were shipped in June and were to be used in construction of a new mosque a few miles away. Nahidian said he paid no money for them, but a Customs and Border Protection officer at the airport blocked the mosque from claiming the tiles, citing the sanctions. A letter from Customs and Border Protection had initially informed the mosque that the tiles must be shipped back or destroyed.\n\nWashington\n\nFord: Strong winds on Monday led to fire growth in central and eastern Washington that prompted new mandatory evacuations and burned homes, fire officials said. A fire northwest of Spokane that started Sunday near the town of Ford caused residents to scramble to leave their homes Monday, The Spokesman-Review reports. Authorities called for Ford residents and those in nearby communities to immediately evacuate as the Ford Corkscrew Fire threatened hundreds of buildings. Hannah Roach, 18, was with her six other family members as well as pets, including geckos, lizards, dogs and birds packed into their pickup truck, as they stopped for groceries in Loon Lake. Behind her, smoke plumes and glowing orange flames crept over the hillside near where her family lived. “We didn’t actually hear about the fire. We saw it first,” Roach said. “We decided to get ahead of it.” The fire has damaged or destroyed 20 buildings – including eight homes – and has burned through more than 20 square miles, officials said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday authorized the use of federal funds to help with firefighting costs for the Ford Corkscrew fire, officials said. The blaze’s cause is under investigation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia University said Tuesday that it is requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs for the next 30 days, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The university announced the change effective Wednesday, the first day of classes on the Morgantown campus, regardless of a person’s vaccination status. While WVU does not require its students and employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19, the university had set a vaccine verification goal of 80% by Sept. 1. Students, faculty and staff on all campuses are required to provide either vaccine verification or a negative coronavirus test result by Friday. But the rates are well short of that goal. So far just 68.4% of students and 67.5% of faculty and staff on the Morgantown campus have submitted their verification paperwork, with the rates being much lower on the Beckley and Keyser campuses, the school said. In addition, many had not completed a required COVID-19 education module by a Tuesday deadline. WVU also cited the anticipated recommendation of booster shots for long-lasting protection against the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds or even thousands of Afghan refugees could be headed to Fort McCoy for processing, according to Pentagon officials. Afghans are scrambling to find ways to escape after the Taliban overran their country over the past week, initiating the blitz with U.S. troops weeks away from the Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. Garry Reid, director of the Department of Defense’s Afghanistan Crisis Action Group, told reporters Monday that the U.S. Army is working to set up reception centers for Afghan refugees at Fort McCoy in western Wisconsin and Fort Bliss in Texas. He said the Army is preparing to receive as many as 22,000 refugees at the two bases as well as at Fort Lee in Virginia. Fort McCoy spokeswoman Tonya Townsell said Monday that the base, located between Tomah and Sparta, has been notified it will receive refugees and is prepared to house them in soldiers’ barracks as well as provide them with food and medical care. Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement saying the state stands ready to assist Afghans seeking refuge. The last time Fort McCoy served as a refugee center was in 1980, when the base housed 14,000 Cubans who fled from Fidel Castro’s government.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park won’t implement a timed-entry system at least in the next year, but it’s possible eventually, the park’s superintendent said. Yellowstone is among the busiest national parks during the summer. Other busy parks, including Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, have implemented timed entry, which requires visitors to reserve a time when they may enter. The goal is to reduce auto traffic, which at Yellowstone’s busier entrances can stretch up to a mile during summer, the Cody Enterprise reports. Timed entry in Yellowstone would most likely be limited to the South entrance north of Grand Teton National Park and West entrance near West Yellowstone, Montana, Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said Friday. The gate west of Cody and the Montana gates outside Gardiner and Cooke City are less busy. A decision on timed entry would be made far in advance, after consultation with the public and likely coordination with Grand Teton, Sholly said. “I don’t think it needs to be implemented next year or the immediate future,” Sholly said. Yellowstone has been setting tourism records this year after being shut down at the start of the 2020 summer season due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/19"}]}

The surveyor notified a senior geologist and the slab was eventually donated as a semi-public display at Biloela State High School in Queensland, Australia.\n\nThe slab includes tiny to small-sized tracks, and likely belong to ornithischian dinosaurs, the researchers said.\n\nAccording to Romilio, the dinosaurs were very small and when they left the marks on the boulder, they were traveling less than 4 mph. The largest track was left by a dinosaur measuring about 30 inches at the hip, the researchers said.\n\nReferring to past research, Romilio said that similar findings show dinosaurs with similar footprints were plant-eaters. They had long legs, chunky bodies, short arms and a small head with a beak.\n\nThe slab also contains about 100 circles, indicating that there were invertebrates and a fast-moving river.\n\n“These animals were making a meager living out of what was coming through the sediments,” Romilio said in another video.\n\nRocks containing dinosaur footprints used as bookends, parking lot markers\n\nCommunity members contacted Romilio about the specimen containing 66 prints once they found out about his previous work. He said it’s common for fossils of this sort to hide in plain sight.\n\n\"It’s incredible to think that a piece of history this rich was resting in a schoolyard all this time,\" he said, adding that he used advanced 3D imaging and light filters to see \"hidden details\" in the dinosaur footprints.\n\nA second specimen the researchers looked at was found at a mine called Boundary Hill, then transported to the Callide Mine Office, the researchers said. When Romilio looked into it, it was being used at the entrance of a parking lot.\n\nThe rock contains two footprints left by a dinosaur walking on two legs, likely measuring around 31 inches in length, he said on the university’s website.\n\nThe third specimen contains a single print and was being used as a bookend, Romilio said.\n\nPreviously, early Jurassic tracks were found at three sites in Queensland: Mount Morgan, Carnarvon Gorge and Biloela.\n\nThe researchers said this latest discovery is a sign of \"the prevalence of ornithischian dinosaurs across the region\" and gives scientists \"an unprecedented snapshot\" of how dinosaurs moved and behaved in Australia.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry. It is a $1.17 trillion industry, according to IRI.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/florida-red-flag-law/index.html", "title": "Florida's red flag law, championed by Republicans, is taking guns ...", "text": "Tampa, Florida CNN —\n\nTwice a week from her courtroom, Florida 13th Circuit Court Judge Denise Pomponio decides who in Hillsborough County can no longer be trusted with a gun.\n\nIn just the last two months, she has taken away the firearm privileges of dozens of people, including a dad accused of threatening to “shoot everyone” at his son’s school, a woman who police say attempted suicide and then accidentally shot her boyfriend during a struggle for her revolver, a husband who allegedly fired multiple rounds in the street to “blow off steam” after losing a family member, a bullied 13-year-old witnesses overheard saying, “If all of 8th grade is missing tomorrow you will know why,” and a mother arrested for brandishing a handgun at another mom after a school bus incident between their daughters.\n\nThis is Florida’s “red flag” law in action. Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/health/how-to-get-teens-exercising-wellness/index.html", "title": "How to help your teen get moving | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s no secret that exercise is important for your health, whatever your age. And it’s tempting to assume kids have no problem staying active. After all, there is gym class in school, recess for the younger ones and organized sports – lots of organized sports. But children, and especially teenagers, are far less active than you would think.\n\nAdolescents should be getting at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity every day, according to the World Health Organization. Yet a 2019 study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal showed less than 20% of school-going adolescents around the globe are getting this much activity, with girls less active than boys. In the United States, that figure is only slightly higher, with 24% of children ages 6 to 17 being physically active for 60 minutes per day, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhat’s behind these dismal numbers? Many things. The allure of organized sports is fading, mainly due to its increasing costs, time commitment and often-hypercompetitive nature. Just 38% of kids ages 6 to 12 were playing an organized sport in 2018, down from 45% in 2008, according to the Aspen Institute. The Covid-19 pandemic may have further accelerated the downward trend, the Aspen Institute wrote in its State of Play 2021 report.\n\nThen there’s technology. Nearly half of US teens say they are online “almost constantly,” according to a Pew Research Center study, up from just 24% in 2014-2015. And recess and outside playtime are no longer mandatory in most schools, said Carol Harrison, senior clinical exercise physiologist with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In addition, more kids are driven to school today than in the past, when they walked or biked.\n\n“Many children also come home to a house where both parents may not have yet arrived home from work,” Harrison said. “The result, very often, is gaming on computers and watching TV, which are very often accompanied by eating unhealthy snacks.”\n\nThis lack of movement is concerning, experts say, and not just from a weight perspective. In addition to improving your heart, muscle, bone and metabolic health, regular exercise helps improve your coordination and agility, and the resulting increased blood flow is helpful to the brain, too.\n\n“Studies have shown that kids involved in daily physical activity do better overall with attention and focus, which translates into better academic performance,” she said. “It also helps with impulse control and better management of emotions.”\n\nWays to boost physical activity\n\nHow do you get your teen to bust a sweat? While it can often be a challenge, there are many ways to introduce more physical activity into children’s lives.\n\nMake motion a fun, social experience\n\nNo one wants to be told to get out there and start running. Instead, look for activities you can all enjoy together. This can be as simple as a family bike ride, a round of beanbag toss or a trip to the park with friends. On days off, schedule a camping trip, where a daily swim, hike or paddling session is on the agenda.\n\nSkateboarding keeps kids on the move. Exercise also improves youths' focus and attention. Sutthichai Supapornpasupad/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\n“Focus on fun,” Harrison said. “With most kids, fun is a necessary ingredient.” So is the social aspect. “Studies have shown that the No. 1 reason most adults start and continue an exercise program is the social component,” she said. “Kids are the same.”\n\nConsider organized sports\n\nOrganized sports are good at helping teens build social connections and learn perseverance and teamwork. But some programs are more focused on winning and less on nurturing skills. If your teen is eager to master a particular sport, a competitive program might be a great fit. But teens who are in organized sports for the fun and socialization may prefer a less-competitive environment.\n\nAnd be aware coaches play a big role in a team’s activity level, said Jennifer Agans, an assistant professor in the department of recreation, park and tourism management at Penn State in University Park, Pennsylvania. Some run less-active practices, where players might spend a lot of time listening to instructions or waiting in line to take their turn in a basketball shooting drill.\n\nThink outside the box\n\nNot all kids are going to enjoy organized sports, especially if they are not competitive. But maybe they would enjoy rock climbing, skateboarding or the performing arts. “My entry point was youth circus,” Agans said, “and trapeze is a growing youth activity today.”\n\nRock climbing is a great alternative activity for teenagers, especially those not in to organized sports. Dedy Andrianto/E+/Getty Images\n\nThere is also dance, yoga, martial arts, ultimate frisbee, badminton, pickleball and more. Currently trending: virtual reality exercise, something Agans said will likely be prominent in the future. Studies already are showing it has the potential to have a positive effect on physical activity.\n\nSneak it in\n\nExercise doesn’t strictly equate with sports. Chores burn calories, for example, so assign your kids the age-appropriate ones that require the most movement. Think mowing the lawn or vacuuming versus dusting or drying the dishes. Creating a garden is another good option, Harrison said, as gardens involve planting, watering, pulling weeds and more.\n\nChores such as mowing the lawn are a good way for teens to break a sweat and burn some calories. soupstock/Adobe Stock\n\nCompetitions can also promote activity. Challenge your teen to see who can run the fastest, do the most sit-ups or walk the most steps every day or week. Use small gifts as a reward. And don’t overlook volunteer work, which often involves a lot of motion. Perhaps they can participate in a trail-building event or assist someone in packing and moving boxes.\n\nBe tuned in to your teen\n\nIf teens suddenly show no interest in an activity they normally enjoy, sit down for a talk. Maybe their lack of interest in swimming is because they are suddenly embarrassed to be seen in a swimsuit, Agans said. Or perhaps they want to drop out of soccer because a new teammate is making fun of them, or they don’t have a friend on the team this year.\n\n“Interpersonal constraints like these can stop people from doing activities they like to do,” she said, so don’t assume your teen has suddenly lost the motivation to move. Something else could be going on.\n\nWatch, too, for signs of exercise addiction, which involves excessive exercising and is often linked with eating disorders. Signs of compulsive exercise include losing a lot of weight, exercising more after eating a lot or missing a workout, and refusing to skip a workout, even when tired, sick or injured.\n\nPoint out the positives\n\nAs teens are finding activities they enjoy, make sure to note all of the positives resulting from their increased movement, whether that’s stronger muscles, better sleep or higher energy levels. That can help them on the days in which their motivation wanes – something that happens to children and adults alike.\n\n“Kids can learn to be excited to move,” Agans said. “We need to set them on a path where they have a foundation of enjoyment with movement that will get them to seek out activity as young adults.”", "authors": ["Melanie Radzicki Mcmanus"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/08/cat-commentary-life-joe-truskot/77549658/", "title": "My Life with Joe", "text": "Cat Truskot\n\nThe Salinas Californian\n\nColumn 1\n\nRoasted Chicken\n\nSunsets have always been my favorite. I loved to sit on top of the potting shed among the climbing roses and watch the sun go down behind the neighbors' fences. There were plenty of birds to study … but that was business. The sun going down was pure pleasure. It was orange and pretty and meant the grass would be dry, not all wet with the drizzle that happens when the fog flows in. The sun setting also meant Joe would be coming home from work soon and would be eager to see me and feed me. What joy he seemed to get when I rubbed up against his lower leg. Whether I was hungry or not, I always ate a little of the food he put out just in case he got the wrong message and stopped doing it.\n\nYes, for most of my life, I always thought positively of sunsets. That ended suddenly at my last visit to the vet. It was time for my annual poking with needles, which I don't like, and the warm massaging by the vet's hands which I adore. The lady vet used the word \"sunset\" but she applied it to \"me.\" In her opinion I was close to the end of \"my\" day.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt's a fact we all have to face, I suppose, and certainly a moment that was important for me to think about — and I have with considerable effort. I now feel strongly that I shouldn't leave this earth without more people understanding my accomplishments and the obstacles I had to overcome to create the favorable and mostly comfortable home I've enjoyed. Yes, he could have given me more tuna water and more food with gravy in it and laid off a couple of those baths which I clearly didn't need, but those are small and forgivable points.\n\nSo with that preface, I decided through purrs, blank stares, occasional growls and hisses, some head butting, a few meows and much telepathy, to dictate my story to Joe, who has typed it into the computer. I could have done the typing myself as Joe knows perfectly well. Indeed, I have spent more than a few moments showing him I could get letters to appear on the computer screen usually while he was sitting right in front of it and concentrating on some unrelated topic. He never figured out I was trying to write, \"My food bowl is empty.\" But I must agree with him that although I'm good at typing I'm just not very adept at correcting my typos.\n\nI'll tell you all where I actually came from a little later, but for now let's go to that warm Sunday afternoon in July 2002. Joe had roasted a chicken and was busy enjoying it while sitting on a chair on his patio. I'd done some advance work scoping out his yard and noticed that there were no other cats and, thank god, no little barky dogs — which seemed to be everywhere else in the neighborhood. I was quite athletic at that time and could easily escape up and over a fence given the slightest indication of hostility.\n\nJoe was distracted by the smell and taste of that roasted chicken and I must admit its aroma convinced me I needed to make my move.\n\nWith a sort of distant expression on his face, Joe looked up. A piece of chicken was still in his mouth and he just stared at me. I was maybe 10 feet away. He froze in that position and I figured that a few feet closer would still provide plenty of escape paths. I lifted my head, pointed my nose in his direction and gave my nostrils an exaggerated wiggle — as if sampling the air. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, now that I'm thinking about it, but I hadn't eaten anything substantial in nearly two days and I really wanted some of that warm chicken. I sniffed again.\n\nYep, it worked. Up Joe went, grabbed a little clean sheet of paper, tore some chicken up and put it on the ground between us. I'd backed away a few steps just to make sure there was no funny business attached to his charity. But sure enough, he returned to his chair and it was obvious I was free to go taste le poule en papier. It was good. He's a decent cook. I tried to remember my manners, though, and ate slowly, savoring every morsel.\n\nHe looked down saw the empty paper and then gave me more — thigh meat this time. What heaven!\n\nIt turns out Joe at 52 had never owned a pet. That's why, in large part, I'm writing this commentary. So you might understand how much training I had to do with this fellow.\n\nSo that was the start. After I'd finished a second helping that was much more generous than the first, I walked a little closer to Joe, sat down — still facing him because you never know about humans — and started washing. I always begin with front paws to my face, then my chin, my chest, my sides, my back paws, hips and rump. It's then I noticed that Joe was staring at me with his mouth open again.\n\nHe looked at my backside carefully and came to the conclusion that I must be a Salinas street cat that got its tail whacked off. This caused a rush of sympathy from him to me and I did nothing to stop it. (I actually was born with a bit of a tail that he hadn't yet noticed, but we'll get to that in a little bit.)\n\nJoe put away the chicken and decided to work in his rose garden for the rest of this fateful afternoon. I just hung around and watched him. Then, opportunity struck. I am indeed lucky.\n\nAs he was dead-heading a rose bush near the patio, I noticed a little motion over by the back fence. I suspected something like this when I was surveying the landscape but wasn't sure. With Joe watching I darted as fast as I could across the lawn into the back garden and BANG — got that mouse. I paraded with it just long enough for Joe to see what I'd done, watched him smile and then I jumped back over the fence into a neighbor's yard to enjoy the snack and not to be too much in Joe's face on the first day.\n\nThis little evidence of my usefulness made a profound impression on Joe. How was I supposed to know that he'd had to throw out all of his wooden spoons and bleach all of his utensils because a mouse had gotten into his kitchen drawers through a tiny hole in the back wall and chewed on some and piddled on the others?\n\nAnd here's what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 2\n\nKibbles and bits of info prove invaluable\n\nAfter eating the roast chicken and catching the mouse on the Sunday we met, I returned to Joe's backyard on Monday, waited around under a rose bush and watched the birds flitting around Joe's feeder. Well, I actually caught one spitzy for lunch but had the good sense to eat it over in the neighbor's yard again. Bird feathers go everywhere even when you are careful and cats just aren't very good at hiding their trails.\n\nWhen Joe came home after work, he looked out on the patio. I'd made sure my back was to him (as if I didn't know he was there — I heard the garage door open, for goodness sake). I was looking over at that spot where I caught the mouse.\n\nHe opened the sliding door and I turned around and gave him my friendliest \"meow.\" Sure thing, off he went to the refrigerator and pulled out the leftover chicken. It was awfully nice of this guy to remove the bones and just give me the meat. So clearly he knew a few good things about pets. He wasn't much interested in his garden that evening and went about getting his own supper, watching television and not coming outside. (He likes the nature shows and I have a story to tell you about that but it will have to wait until later.)\n\nOn the following day, Joe left more of that chicken outside before he went to work, I forget where I was in the morning. But the food was there when I showed up around noon. And I decided to sit in the warm sunshine and enjoy his yard again. It was really very beautiful with lots of private places to hide and do those things we all do in private places. That's when I first experienced the potting shed and the mass of climbing pink roses growing up there. It was a near perfect place to look at life in that neighborhood — unseen and unspoiled and unquestionably good camouflage to whack birds. I'm essentially a white cat with very large, irregular black patches. When I hide underneath shrubbery in bright sunshine, I'm pretty much invisible.\n\nWhen Joe came home this next day, he saw me on the patio, put his hand on his chin, shook his head, and disappeared in the kitchen. He returned with some sardines on a paper plate. Apparently, the chicken was gone. Sardines aren't something you usually feed to cats but Joe didn't know that and the gesture was generous and genuine so I accepted the silvery little critters with grace and gratitude. I did like their fishiness but could have done with less salt.\n\nCat food appeared the next evening and a steady stream of culinary delights, some tastier than others, has been present every day ever since.\n\nI heard Joe in the house that week describing his progress to a friend on the phone.\n\n\"I decided to go buy some real cat food,\" he said. \"I went to the grocery store, stood in the pet food aisle and was just overwhelmed. There are so many choices! I wondered whether Princess (that's the word he used when he was referring to me now) would prefer the 'Country Home Platter' or the 'Mariner's Feast?' So I bought four cans of each. I also bought her these cute kibbles. One is shaped like a chicken drumstick, one is a fish, one is like a rib-eye steak, and one is a little white egg.\"\n\nI'm not sure how he decided on the name \"Princess.\" Perhaps it was my manners. I prided myself with control, enjoyed keeping myself well groomed and — this is the one that probably did it — striking graceful poses every time I sat down, especially if he was looking.\n\nJoe was in the garden on the following Sunday. Next to his chair was a stool which he used as a sort of end table. He stopped his work to drink some iced tea and take a break. So he was sitting reading a book and I decided that that stool was the perfect place for my next lesson.\n\nAlthough we had been interacting for the past eight days, we never had any physical contact. Joe had never even scratched my head and likewise I kept my distance. I jumped up onto the stool and quickly laid down. He glanced over at me and kept very still. I looked away, feigning disinterest. Joe went back to his book.\n\nSo, as he was reading \"Out of Africa\" by Karen Blixen, I thought I'd give him a little training on \"Out of Salinas\" by me. Concentrating on the Danish writer's pretty English prose, Joe didn't notice that my paw was slowly approaching the back of his hand. It was the other one that held up the book. This one was just uselessly resting on the chair arm. I gradually placed my paw on the back of his hand. He tensed up. Then I extended my claws only slightly and made contact with his flesh. I gently pulled his free hand closer and closer to me and somehow placed it on the back of my head. He made the connection. One can easily read a book and scratch a cat's neck at the same time — it takes no special talent. I started purring as loudly as I could and he smiled. Apparently, he'd never heard a cat do that or at least never in response to anything he'd initiated. I could tell he liked it.\n\nJoe figured out something else on that second Sunday and I have to give him credit for making another connection. He was proving to be a fast learner. As he was getting ready to go inside for the night, he looked down at my bowl of kibbles on the patio. He liked to look inside it throughout the day and often rushed into the house to fill it up whenever it was slightly empty. So I decided to send him a strong message.\n\nWhen he looked down on this day, he'd noticed I'd eaten all the cute little drumsticks, rib eye steaks and fish but left in the dish all of those lousy tasting eggs. I'm a cat. We're carnivores. We want meat. No exceptions. Feed the eggs to a dog! He seemed to have gotten this message and the next time he filled the dish, it was with plain ole Wiskas — the same thing I grew up on.\n\nAnd then, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 3\n\nHistory and a 'Hello Kitty' blanket\n\nAfter our first week together, I stopped scouring the neighborhood for places to hang out. Joe's yard was Eden. In truth — and somewhat verified by Joe during a summer walk in the neighborhood one year later, I was born a few blocks away in a detached garage toward the back of a yard. We, a group of about eight or ten of us — some related, some not, called that cold garage home. It smelled of ancient motor oil, dirty pesticides, moldy newspapers and well, foul things —dragged in by my housemates and abandoned. A carport on the side of the garage with some broken lawn furniture was also part of this sad domicile.\n\nAt any rate, my old man was a mean cuss and the top cat in the garage. He treated my mother and my aunts like they were disposable. We kittens shut the hell up whenever he came around and lived in fear — usually somewhere in the cobwebbed shadows.\n\nIn retrospect, this former life helped me develop an ability to be almost anywhere I wanted to be and be invisible. This tactic came in handy several times later and I'll tell you about those scary instances soon.\n\nThe gray haired lady who took care of us, visited us every day but rarely did much other than put Wiskas in a dish the size of a bird bath and expect us all to eat from the same plate. I don't think she was allowed to drive a car anymore and that's why the garage was all ours.\n\nOne of the lady's younger friends took me and my sister on a car trip once when we were very young. I don't remember much about it though I do recall some awful smells and a weird sleepiness afterward. I felt sore, too, for a couple weeks like somebody bit me on the bottom.\n\nI suppose in her feeble way the lady kept an eye on us but I think there were just too many of us to garner the special individual attention most cats need. I remember playing with her and my sister a lot when we were kittens but then as we got older she seemed less interested. She coughed a lot, too, which has always made me a bit jumpy — even to this day.\n\nIt was after a morning when she didn't quite put enough food out for all of us to eat that my old man crawled home in a rotten mood. For some reason, he'd decided that I was his target that day. I swear I was just sitting there with my sister watching the others eat when he came over to me, growling at first and then hissing, spitting, and swatting me with his paw.\n\nWho needs that, right?\n\nSo I said good bye to my mother who understood my need to leave and licked my sister's face and took off on my adventure. I never returned.\n\nOf course, I was clever enough to catch birds and mice, and God knows there were enough rats in that Salinas neighborhood to feed a pride of lions.\n\nIt was my luck that I only spent a week or two roving around before I wandered into Joe's rose garden and met perhaps the biggest sap in town. He fussed a lot over inconsequential things in those early days. And, if he wanted to call me 'Princess\" I could live with that.\n\nSo the weeks went by and I took up an increasingly happy residence in Joe's yard, sleeping now on one of the patio chairs or, if it was particularly cold, up on the roof next to the warm chimney. I lived outside and he lived inside. I even let him pick me up now. He seemed to be fascinated by my ever-increasing belly and my stubby tail. I made sure I purred loudly so he'd know it was OK.\n\nWhenever I caught a mouse or a rat, some part of it — usually the crushed bloody head, tail or an occasional paw was there for him to notice. It was my equivalent of a punched time card. I was doing my job and earning my keep. He buried these \"less edibles\" in the garden near a rose bush and seemed pleased with the arrangement. He was startled at first at just how many rodents he was unknowingly sharing his life with.\n\nOne day, Joe showed up with this bright pink \"Hello Kitty\" blanket and put it on one of those patio chairs. He pointed at me and pointed at it, and said something like \"Up. Up. Princess. Up.\"\n\nI mean really! \"Up?\" Poor guy.\n\nHe quickly learned he didn't need to say anything like that. I would go \"Up\" when I felt like going \"Up\" and when there was something special in it for me to go \"Up.\" Pleasing him, reinforcing his congenial behavior still happened to be a priority at the time, so \"Up\" I went and struck an adorable pose.\n\nThen he pulled out of his pocket a black leather collar studded all over with rhinestones and one tiny, tinny bell. He put it around my neck and I didn't struggle too much at first. Then I heard the sound of that darn bell every time I moved or the wind blew. I knew it would spoil my hunting days forever.\n\nThat same morning — thank you Johann Sebastian Bach — Joe happened to be listening to the Cantata BWV No.4 \"Christ lag in todesbanden.\" It was turned up rather loud so he could hear it on the patio. The addition of my little, off-pitch, off-beat noise-maker joining that fine chorus and period ensemble was just as irritating to Joe as it was to me. With one quick motion, Joe yanked the bell off the collar.\n\nThe Bach was indeed fortuitous, \"Christ lay to death in bondage.\" I tolerated the collar for another minute or so and as soon as Joe disappeared I backed out of it easily. It landed under the patio chair. He tried to put it on me again a little later but I wasn't as docile as I was before and squirmed all over the place. He just gave up and stuck it in a drawer somewhere. It reappeared years later, but that's another story.\n\nAnd then, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 4\n\nA calculator moves Joe up a level\n\nEvery month in those days, usually on a Saturday or Sunday morning, Joe spread out all of his bills and letters on the dining room table, plugged in a calculator and proceeded to scribble things onto this and that, tap away on that noisy machine that printed out a long curling tally, and then stuff one piece of paper into another. He'd drag his tongue over the edge, then press it shut with his fingers. I never completely understood why he did these things but they seemed to capture his total attention.\n\nOne weekend, as he was balancing his check book, tapping at that noisy machine, licking his envelopes and putting stamps on them, he heard something unusual. It was a grumbling-like sound that he hadn't ever heard before.\n\n\"Is that the refrigerator?\" he asked himself. It was loud then quiet, loud then quiet. \"Is that the dimmer switch on the light?\" No. He put his ear to the calculator. No. He listened carefully at the window behind him. No, not coming from outside. It was coming from … under the table. He looked on the floor and there was nothing there but the Persian carpet. \"What could it possibly be?\" Then his eyes opened wide. \"You know,\" he thought, \"It sounds like snoring!\"\n\nI mentioned before that Joe has this sliding door that goes out to his patio. He likes to leave that door wide open when he's home. It airs out the house and allows the smell of his many roses to waft into the dining and living room.\n\nJoe was soon to discover what most cat owners know although they may have never heard the word for it. We're crepuscular. That's from the French word for \"twilight.\" But in this sense, it's used to describe our activity level. In normal cats, especially those that live outdoors, we rise before the sun goes up and look for something to eat. We're active until about two hours after sunrise and then we seek out a comfortable place (not too bright, not too warm, not too easily discovered) to sleep through the day. We wake up again in late afternoon, famished, and want to eat something in a hurry. Then we bounce around and play as the sun goes down and stay active to hunt some night creatures. Then about two hours after dark we look for a nice warm spot to rest for the coldest part of the night.\n\nThis said, Joe told all of his visitors — especially those nice ladies that often came to visit, the same ones who brought me toys and treats and who always made a big fuss over me — that \"Princess\" was an outdoor cat. He would feed me, see that I had a good place to sleep but I would not be allowed inside. They shook their heads when they heard this. Remember, Joe had never owned a cat before.\n\nSo there he was working away at the dining room table with its heavy cloth draping over the edge onto the chair seats. There was the sliding door — wide open. There I was absolutely exhausted from the hunt and ready for a warm, dark, safe spot. I'd been up and prowling the neighborhood for nearly four hours. I have told you all that I learned how to be invisible.\n\nAs Joe narrowed down the source of the noise, he lifted the tablecloth and discovered me — all four paws up in the air, mouth a bit opened and sound asleep on the chair next to his. Sorry about the snoring. It stopped when I rolled over. He wasn't sure what to do next. He had visions of me going bonkers, dragging the tablecloth and all that rested on it onto the floor, of me ripping up all the upholstery on his wing-backed chairs, of me knocking over and breaking the Kenyan wood carvings on the mantle that he'd dragged out when he started reading \"Out of Africa.\"\n\nBut here's what actually happened. I felt the tablecloth move. Lifted my head up, looked at Joe through squinting, half-asleep eyes, rolled over, exhaled loudly and was soon snoring again.\n\nIt doesn't sound like much of a turning point in Joe's life, but it was. He'd mostly lived alone and thought he liked it that way. Now, having me in the house, it made him feel entirely different. There was someone else around. Not intrusive, not much bother and yet, someone to talk to and someone who would listen to his mumbling, cussing, singing, noise making and classical music. (When he starts the day with a baroque soprano, I go outside. I've learned to prefer Debussy.)\n\nAgain, it was lucky for him that I was also a talker. And whenever he turned to me and started speaking, I quickly answered him, although I'm not certain he always caught the direction I was trying to turn the conversation.\n\nFrequently, when something was not as I wanted it and Joe was busy, I'd stand in front of him and simply stare at him. My brainwaves said, \"OK, let's review the things I could ever possibly want. Food — have some. Water — bowl is full. Door — wide open. Scratch on head — just had that. Let me see. What might it be?\"\n\nHow about \"Follow me?\" I usually can get him to stop whatever he is doing and look into what I want to show him.\n\nOn one such occasion, I led him outside where he looked around quickly and shouted.\n\n\"It's the hose. I left it on. Oh, what a good kitty.\" Another scratch on the head.\n\nPersonally, I don't care how he wastes water. The yard was flooded. I wanted to walk across it and I do not appreciate getting my feet wet in the process. He needs to know that.\n\nEventually, after hundreds of \"Listen, Repeat; Listen, Repeat\" language exercises, Joe came to understand my most frequent expressions. Indeed, he knows when I say, \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"I want out,\" \"Thank you\" and \"God d****t, cut that s**t out!\"\n\nSince my comfy snooze on Joe's dining room chair ended uneventfully – he started clearing up the papers and putting away things the commotion of which disturbed my sleep, I jumped down on the floor and without looking back went outside for a drink of water. I could feel Joe's eyes on me and knew he must be thinking, \"No harm done.\" And indeed there hadn't been. That was my point.\n\nAs I was drinking from a water dish he placed outside in the garden which the birds loved to sip from – oh, the taste of bird in that water is … heavenly. I heard Joe sigh loudly and slide the door closed.\n\nAnd this is what he did next … to be continued next Saturday.\n\nFollow Joe Truskot on Twitter @truskot_salnews #salinas and like his Facebook.com/joetruskot page.\n\nColumn 5\n\nWhen it rains, it pours\n\nMy comfy snooze on Joe's dining room chair ended uneventfully. He started clearing up his papers and putting away things — the commotion of which woke me. I jumped down and without looking back went outside for a drink of water. I could feel Joe's eyes on me and knew he must be thinking, \"No harm done.\" And indeed there hadn't been.\n\nAs I was lapping up water from a large ceramic bowl he placed in the garden, I heard Joe slide the door closed. I didn't bother to turn around as, truthfully, I was too distracted by the taste of that delicious water with its slight hint of bird.\n\nMy introduction to indoor living at Joe's had to be gradual. \"Let's not rush and spoil a good thing,\" I thought, and the days uneventfully passed.\n\nOne afternoon, Joe was sitting and still making his way through \"Out of Africa\" — he's a slow reader and often mumbles words out loud, especially those that begin with \"Ng\" and \"Mb.\"\n\nAt any rate, he was inside sitting in his big leather chair and the sliding doors were open and I was on the patio and I just walked inside and laid down leaning my head on his foot. I exhaled loudly and stayed there. He did nothing for the longest time and I was all set to shoot right out that door if there was the slightest indication of his panicking.\n\nEventually, I moved my head away and he got up to fill his coffee cup. I watched him for a minute. Then, a spitzy flew right into a picture window and I took off outside to see if I could grab an easy snack. I almost had it but the bird recovered too quickly and flew out of reach. I didn't go back inside but later that day sat beside Joe as he was pulling weeds. Life was good.\n\nIn Salinas, we often get an early rain in October. Although we welcome rain whenever it arrives, no one is ever ready for these sudden showers. That was the case with me and Joe.\n\nWhen the rains started to pelt the grass with blobs of water, I jumped up on the dusty work bench in the potting shed and decided that was a convenient place to watch the wind blow things around.\n\nIt was early evening when the sliding door opened.\n\n\"Princess, Princess,\" Joe called.\n\n\"Meooooooow,\" I answered back and watched him come outside in the downpour and run across the yard to the shed.\n\n\"Meow\" I said when he appeared next to me.\n\n\"Let's go in the house. OK?\" he asked.\n\nI mention this because he started this come-out-of-the-rain thing. Not me.\n\nJoe lifted me up and tucked me under his arm and across the wet grass he ran.\n\nThe patio has an aluminum roof which makes a thunderous racket when rain falls. We sat together on a patio chair, me sitting on his lap now. He soon discovered our body temperature is 104 degrees normally so if we sit long enough on a human being we give off heat. He liked that. We stayed there for awhile watching the roses and trees sway in the wind. Then, he got cold and carried me inside.\n\nWe played together for a while on the living room floor. By now, just about every friend of his brought me a little toy so there was a large collection to choose from. I preferred the furry mice with catnip stomachs. He tossed them and I rushed after them and caught them sometimes in mid air.\n\nWe got tired of doing that rather suddenly. He sat quietly for awhile and just watched me explore the living room.\n\nThe TV was in the big bedroom and that's where Joe went. I followed him. I didn't know how to tell him that I had to go … well, you know … use a litter box. But search as I did, I couldn't find one. So I jumped up on the bed and sat on the corner with him which he seemed OK with as his attention was on the TV.\n\nI turned to him and uttered my \"I've – got – to – go – to – the – bathroom\" meow but for all intents and purposes I might have recited the Preamble of the United States Constitution. His cat lingua was deficient.\n\nFinally, I couldn't hold it any longer. I was busting. I jumped off the bed, went to the bedroom door and asked him once again to let me out. No response. So I went inside the closet and relieved myself.\n\nThere was a terrible commotion. Many harsh words came out of this fellow. He grabbed me and rushed me to the sliding door and meanly put me down on the bricks outside — still shouting at me.\n\nTo tell you that I felt bad about this incident wouldn't express to you how embarrassed and humiliated I was. I had disappointed Joe — that I know. But he put me on the pedestal, told everyone he came in contact with — even those who don't like cats and were being polite — what a godsend his little \"Princess\" was.\n\nThe facts are there for all to see. I'm a mammal. Mammals drink water. Then, mammals have to pee. That's how it works. We can live together comfortably but that has to be understood.\n\nAfter I was tossed outside, Joe got a pail of warm water and some Spic 'n' Span and cleaned up the place where I peed. Awhile later, Joe came outside with a fluffy towel, threw it roughly on one of the chairs and went inside again, closing the sliding door loudly, as if that was supposed to make matters better.\n\nI spent the rest of that rainy night on a chair on the patio. I was left out there to feel terrible about my accident.\n\nYet, all things pass. That's what I've learned over the course of my lifetime. And in just about every circumstance, the enormity of the offense wears away.\n\nThe next morning, Joe put food out, then disappeared in his truck. When he returned, about an hour or so later, he came out onto the patio with a large plastic litter box under his arm and a box of litter with the word \"EXTREME\" written on it in big letters. You can count on him to overdo just about everything.\n\nSo I sat patiently watching him open the box of litter, pour its contents into the plastic tub, smooth it out with his little plastic rake and point to it — indignantly saying \"Do you know what this is? What it's for?\"\n\nI stayed cool. Always be classy when faced with people who want to rub your nose in mistakes you made. I casually stepped inside the box, squatted, peed, stared off into space, turned, smelled and covered it all up — exaggerating my action and making an unnecessarily large mound on top. I stepped outside of the box and walked into the garden with no further comment. If I had a tail, it would have been raised high. I could feel Joe's smile on my back.\n\nThe litter box was placed in a low traffic area inside the house and I rarely used it. Rarely, I say — until the last few months, when I seem to be in and out of it all day and all night long.\n\nThen, here's what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 6\n\nA big belly and 'The Crying Game'\n\nI had just finished a terrific meal — Fancy Feast's Grilled Tuna with Gravy — when I felt Joe staring at me. He'd watched me eat breakfast for at least four months but on this day he seemed particularly focused on my stomach. He was apparently concerned about its increasing size. The gears in Joe's head were spinning fast. I had this horrible feeling that this was not going to end well.\n\nFor the next few days, he kept touching my stomach and groaning. Then one day, out of bloody nowhere, he grabbed me and shoved me into this cardboard box that he'd cut holes in.\n\nI was so scared. I started crying.\n\nI'd heard him use the word \"vet\" on the telephone a bit earlier that day and I was certain that that had something to do with me. There was also a later phone call where he told one of his friends \"I'm not going to raise a litter of damn kittens\" which confused me to no end.\n\nSometimes, when things go down faster than you can manage, the only thing you can do is cry like a baby. And as soon as I realized the cardboard box thing wasn't a game, and it and me got put inside a stuffy car, I knew there was going to be trouble.\n\nEvery three seconds, I let out a pathetic cry. Joe was timing them! I continued for what seemed like hours but was in fact about ten minutes until we got to the vet's office.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, Joe kept saying softly, \"Princess, everything is going to be OK, darling. It's OK, sweetie pie. My honey bunch. My precious little girl.\" But I knew it wasn't going to be OK and that he was in for a shock — a really big one. It would be one of those moments when a human's face turns all red and his or her eyes bulge out.\n\nJoe carried the box with me inside it into the waiting room. He opened it up and sat me on his lap. I was too scared to do anything so I shut up. There was this large blue bird in a cage with enormous feet and talons. It had this gigantic beak and its squawk was louder than a flock of crows. Its owner was a woman who kept staring at me trying to get Joe involved in a conversation. I was fine on his lap but that noisy bird upset the sick dog on a leash across from us whose owners, a man and his son, kept trying to calm down. This critter was missing whole patches of fur from his back. I didn't know what was up with that but I certainly did not want that disease. I leaned up against Joe and pretended to be invisible.\n\nSometime later, a young lady handed Joe a clipboard and told him to fill the forms out. He scribbled the best he could as I was now attempting to disappear inside his arm pit. The further away from this group I could get the better.\n\nShe came back shortly and said, \"Follow me.\"\n\nJoe carried me into this tiny room. She closed the door and we just sat there. Joe let me explore the exam table and then walk around on the floor a bit. I must have smelled about 20 different cats. It was as confusing as the perfume counter at a department store. (Of course, I don't know what that would smell like but I've heard people talk.) The door opened and in walked the lady vet. She put me on the table and said, \"Hello Princess.\" And began to press her warm hands on my neck and then on my back and then on my belly and then my hips and then my … she stopped suddenly.\n\n\"Princess?\" she said looking over at Joe. \"You better pick another name. This is a neutered male.\"\n\n\"It can't be,\" Joe replied. \"All my friends said it was a female. These people have owned cats for years! They all agreed she was a she.\"\n\n\"No way,\" she laughed. \"In a male, the anus is about an inch from the penis. In a female it's much closer. Joe, this is a very well fed boy kitty.\" She squeezed open my mouth which I still don't care for and looked at my teeth. He appears to be maybe a little older than a year or so.\"\n\nThe gentle vet gave me a round of shots which pricked at first. I got something for leukemia, feline AIDS, and rabies.\n\n\"He's got fleas, too. So buy something for them at the front desk,\" she said firmly.\n\nShe scratched my head. \"Goodbye. Boy Truskot. You're lucky to have found a good home.\" And then said to Joe. \"You'll need to buy a proper cat carrier, too. They're not that expensive and you'll find you'll use it a lot. Do get something for those fleas. You won't want them in your house.\"\n\nWell, there it was. Joe's face was still red — he thought he was knowledgeable about nature but certainly got this wrong. It wasn't entirely his fault the mistake was made. He never owned a cat, never ever had a pet. And his friends just all went along.\n\nI cried all the way home again too, this time thinking, \"What if he doesn't want me anymore? What if he only wants a female? Winter is coming and I hate being cold and outside.\"\n\nSo, when we got back to the house. Joe opened the box and I jumped out. He went to the cupboard and put some fish flavored treats in a bowl and set them next to my indoor water bowl.\n\n\"Good kitty,\" he said. Well, that was encouraging.\n\nI just looked at him though and still felt sad. It wasn't at all my fault. I always preferred the attention I got from his lady friends — way more than those noisy guy pals of his.\" I was a natural born ladies' man.\n\nI finished my treats and then just sat and stared at Joe as he examined all the supplies he bought. They included Frontline, flea powder, a flea collar, a flea comb, and — boy, do I have a story coming your way about this last item — flea shampoo.\n\n\"Well\" he said \"What am I going to call you? Max, Rocket, Dil, Rex, No.\" He opened the sliding door for me and I thought it was best to go outside but I hesitated just a moment and looked up at him sympathetically. I really do appreciate all he's done for me so I gave him a head butt on the leg and headed for the door. What could I do if others jumped to the wrong conclusion?\n\n\"C'mon, buddy, let's go outside,\" he said and I did. \"My buddy, hmmm. Buddy is a good name.\"\n\nAnd this is what he did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 7\n\nOut with pink, in with rawhide\n\nDuring the next few days, Joe changed.\n\nNow that he realized I was a neutered male and that it was his, and his friends’ fault I was misidentified, he felt he had to rectify the situation. So he chose to address me in a deeper voice!\n\n“Well, Bud,” he’d say. “What’s on your agenda today?”\n\nWhen his visitors came by to see me, he told them. “Oh, my Buddy. He’s such a jock. He doesn’t just walk around the couch to get to the other side, he runs in a straight line up and over the couch and on into the bedrooms. Why just the other day,” he continued, “I watched Bud walk along the top of the fence boards. Not the side railing, mind you, but the very top end of the boards. And you know what he figured out? If he does this over by the garage at night, he’s out of range of the motion detector and he can surprise whatever creature happens to be in the back yard without the light coming on!”\n\nAll of which just happens to be true but Joe thought it was necessary to emphasize my athletic prowess — he only knew half of what I could do, and often did.\n\nYes, I had endured the endless “Princess” gushing and now I was well into my butchification program.\n\nThe ‘Hello Kitty’ pink flannel baby blanket was replaced by a colorful, but badly tattered, weaving from Mexico. The rhinestone collar continued to stay in the drawer where he parked a few weeks back. (It reappeared months later but I’ll tell you about that in a few weeks.) My plastic food dish was replaced by earthenware bowls, hand thrown in his pottery class.\n\nHalloween approached and Joe’s extra effort to shore up his new understanding of me resulted in his selecting a tough guy costume for me. I became John Wayne. My cowboy gear came complete with a hat for my head and a blue bandanna tied around my neck. He’d actually spent time looking for a six-shooter and holster that would fit around my narrow hips but couldn’t find them in Salinas. Ditto four leather boots made for cat feet.\n\nI amazed myself with how much I could put up with for free room and board.\n\nSeveral of the early trick-or-treaters laughed at my costume but then so many of them started coming to the door that Joe couldn’t find time to adjust my hat every second. He didn’t see me pull it off and swat it under the couch.\n\nI liked the bandanna though and purposely walked about the living room like I was bow-legged from riding a horse all day, much to everyone’s delight and laughter. I liked the attention and the occasional scratches on the head and, you know, my John Wayne wasn't half bad.\n\nEventually, I rode shotgun for Joe by sitting on top of his wing back chair and policing the strangers as they came for free candy. A couple of the trick-or-treaters brought along their dogs which I didn’t appreciate so I jumped off the chair back and retired to the bedroom for the rest of the evening.\n\nA few days later, Joe and I were watching television in the big bedroom. I was never particularly interested in TV as there were no smells associated with it. But I enjoyed just laying around next to Joe as he looked at the exotic scenery.\n\nI mentioned earlier that he loved nature programs. He often made me snooze through endless hours of whales and porpoises — mammals who gave up their comfy life on land to eat fish (good!) and live in water all the time (bad!). They couldn’t go back now even if they tried. I mean really — have you seen the elephant whales on the beach at Año Nuevo? Graceful isn’t a word I’d use!\n\nThen there were millions of penguins. They may technically be birds, but waddling around on ice sheets and diving into frozen oceans — real birds just don’t do that.\n\nOne night, for some reason, Joe thought I should pay particular attention to a program about African lions.\n\n“Look, Bud,” he said and held my head toward the TV screen. He actually forced me to watch.\n\n“See, they're your cousins,” he said.\n\nThen, this big male lion started vocalizing, calling to others in the pride in that guttural and growling dialect we recognize as a roar. It shook the entire bedroom. Yes, they’re my cousins and I know enough of their brutal language to understand they weren’t saying, “Hello honey pie.”\n\nJoe let go of me and my eyes stayed glued to the TV screen. It was riveting at first. And then this monster of a male, this enormous beast started his monologue. “C’mon gang, let’s go kill and eat the guy taking these pictures ... and that fat house cat back in his truck.” That I couldn’t take anymore.\n\nI turned to Joe and he saw the frightened look on my face.\n\nJoe started laughing — laughing! I was too scared to do anything but jump down off the bed, run to the dining room and hide on a chair underneath the table cloth. I had nightmares for a week after that and avoided that room even when the TV was off. I still haven’t watched another nature program.\n\nAnd then, here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 8\n\nPoor little birdie, traffic training\n\nJoe was on the patio still making his way through “Out of Africa.” I told you he was a slow reader. He was at the part when Karen Blixen gets sick and has to go back to Denmark and the coffee plantation is in peril. He looked sad so I thought I’d cheer him up.\n\nI was lying underneath the birdbath in the dappled light that makes me almost invisible. When this plump little spitzy flew down for a drink and a quick bath, I waited patiently and just when she took off, I leaped into the air, turned upside down, grabbed her with my front paws, shoved her in my mouth, and landed gracefully on all four feet. I trotted back to the patio — spitzy secure in my jaws and very much alive-o. I pranced over to Joe to show him what I just caught.\n\n“Cheeep! Cheeep!” the bird cried, immobilized and held securely in my fangs.\n\nThen it happened.\n\n“Oh, poor little birdie,” Joe said.\n\nImmediately, I knew this wasn’t going to go like I thought it would.\n\nJoe grabbed me and squeezed my jaws open. The spitzy flew across the yard.\n\nI struggled free and raced after it, but she’d taken off quickly and flew a little too high to grab again.\n\nI ran back to Joe and for the first time in our history together raised my voice to him.\n\n“You let it go,” I shouted. “ You jerk!” I raced back to the lawn only to return quickly. “I can’t believe it. You let it go. I caught it and was going to share it with you and you ... let ... it ... go.”\n\nI went off fuming, scaled the 7-foot-back fence and disappeared for the rest of the day in Old Wes’ yard, next door.\n\nJoe looked for me around sunset but I was too angry to return. He peeked over the fence and saw me sitting on a table next to Wes who was looking at a magazine while scratching my head. Served Joe right.\n\nThe next day, we had a conversation. This little chat is one many in my pride have had to have with their owners. It goes like this, “I’m a cat. I kill birds. It’s what I do.”\n\nAs obvious as that is to us, it needs to be understood by all cat owners. If a human wants something dull, harmless and domesticated, go get an ungulate.\n\nAlas, humans are only half logical. They think by anthropomorphizing pets, we’re going to drop our instincts and behave like them.\n\nIf Joe didn’t want me to chase birds, why was he tempting me by filling the bird feeder every few days. Bird seed is what we cats refer to as “bait.”\n\nI think the discussion was worth the effort as that was the last bird Joe pried out of my strong jaws.\n\nThat was back in my prime when my jaws were in fact strong. This morning, for instance, I brought a bird into the house that had crashed into a window and I managed to catch. I don’t know how it happened but once I got it in the living room my old jaws were just too weak to hold on to it, especially with all that fluttering. It got loose and was banging into windows, perching on picture frames and clinging onto blinds. It created more noise than even I expected. Joe is accustomed to loose birds in the house by now and has worked out a quick little maneuver using a broom that coaxes the bird into the wild blue yonder — much to its delight. Yes, it’s been awhile since I have been able to leave a nice pile of feathers behind the philodendron.\n\nIt’s now time to talk about the front yard. It’s quite different from the one in the back and is routinely trafficked by outsiders — human, canine, avian, and feline. The front lawn has been the scene of several incidents which involve me and in their different ways were terrifying.\n\nCars and trucks rumble and race up and down Chaparral Street all day and a good part of the night. People walk dogs, push strollers, and accompany children heading off to the elementary school around the corner. There’s always lots to see and smell. It’s busier than other streets in the neighborhood because it’s a short cut between North Main and Natividad Road. Joe knows its danger to pets from personal experience — having nearly squashed two Chihuahuas who darted out in front of him on his way home from work one night.\n\nPart of a cat’s attraction to the street is our insatiable desire to smell car tires. And there are lots of them in our neighborhood. The closest comparison that humans might understand is their own universal delight in learning the most horrendous things about the most impeccable people — “He was discovered doing what with whom?”\n\nJoe frequently lectured me about crossing the street. “Stay on this side,” he would tell me, “don’t you go over there.”\n\nI mostly ignored Joe as you probably guessed.\n\nOne evening, he looked outside and spotted me under one of the neighbor’s trucks ... across the street.\n\n“Lots of interesting smelling tires over here,” I’d been thinking.\n\nThen Joe came to the curb and called, “Buddy, Buddy, come back here.” Which, of course, I heeded not and continued smelling each tire. There were a lot of cars and the story the tires told me was getting really exciting.\n\n“Get over here,” Joe interrupted.\n\n“Well, if he had just left me alone,” I thought, “I would have gotten bored eventually and returned.”\n\nA car sped by between us, going faster than it should have.\n\nJoe’s face got pale.\n\nA pickup truck rattled passed from the other direction with a motorcycle right behind it.\n\nSniff, sniff. Oh, somebody’s in heat. Oooo, somebody’s after her.\n\n“Get over here right now!” Joe said in his lowest, meanest and most exasperated voice.\n\nSo I trotted back to the curb. Stopped. Looked up the street. Stopped. Looked down the street. Coast clear. I sauntered back to Joe uttering a cute little teasing, “Meow” as I walked past him and headed toward the house.\n\nJoe followed me, opened the front door and we both went in. We sat together for a while but it was warm out that night and I didn’t want to stay inside. I convinced Joe to let me out in the back yard again and he went to bed.\n\nAround 2 in the morning, a car slammed on its brakes, skidded across the pavement, and crashed into several parked ones across the street. Joe bolted upright in bed and in a panic shouted, “Buddy!”\n\nHere’s what Joe did next … to be continued\n\nColumn 9\n\nWahumff, fump, fump\n\nThe noise from the car crash in the middle of the night wouldn’t stop. Joe jumped up from his bed and peeked between the blinds to see what happened.\n\nA car was sitting in the middle of the street in front of the house — upside down. Its lights were on but pointing out in different directions. Its wheels were still spinning around — out of sync with the incessant and very loud rap music. A confused cloud of dust, steam and exhaust swirled about the crash site as if looking for a safe place to settle down.\n\nFrom the passenger’s side window which faced the house, Joe watched as an arm and then slowly the rest of a man struggled to climb out of the car. The CD player blasted out full volume with the bass turned up and the speakers vibrating the night air and the ground itself. “Wahumff, fump, fump; wahumff, fump, fump; wahumff, fump, fump … endlessly.”\n\nThe man extricated himself and leaned against the crashed car for a moment, then he staggered a bit. His entire body shook for a second. unexpectedly, he punched the side of the car, scolding it for its reckless behavior and demonstrating the level of his intelligence. He shook himself again and found his bearings. He stood firmly upright on the pavement, apparently sorting out the situation. He looked up the street and then down the street and then took off running toward Main Street with a “feets do yo’ stuff” impetus.\n\nJoe grabbed the phone in the bedroom, dialed 911 and reported the accident. He put on his flip-flops then opened the front door and went out to investigate.\n\n“Meow,” I said as he stepped out on the front sidewalk. I thankfully had been searching the rooftop for a rat I had smelled earlier and was well away from the street, but I saw the entire thing happen so Joe wasn't just making this column up.\n\n“You just stay up there,” Joe said brusquely and hurried over to see if anyone else was in the car.\n\nOf course, I had no intention of getting involved. I’m a cat. We run from accidents ... too!\n\nThe scene was surreal though. The car lights were on, each shining in a different direction. Fluids were dripping onto the pavement. The air smelled of anti-freeze, burned tires, strangers, and gin 'n' juice. And the CD player droned on and on, blasting out rap. It was the first time Joe ever listened long enough to hear the singer’s actual words. “I took my pole and I shoved it in …” and so on with absolutely nothing else left to the imagination.\n\nTwo teenagers who lived across the street also came out in their pajamas to investigate the accident.\n\n“Is anyone in there?” one asked Joe as he tried to see inside the dark car.\n\nThe headlights stuck on high beam pretty much blinded them.\n\n“I can’t see anything so I don’t think so,” Joe said, then added. “I phoned the police and they should be here soon. Let me go get a flashlight though.” He walked back into the house and searched the hall closet for one.\n\nAlthough I stayed motionless up on the roof, I’ve heard Joe tell this story to his friends over and over again so I know what happened next.\n\nRemember, it was the middle of the night and Joe wasn’t totally awake. After searching around in the hallway closet, he found the flashlight he was looking for, tested it — the batteries worked — then turned suddenly and smacked his head right into the sharp edge of the closet door.\n\n“Ouch,” he cried and uttered angrily one or two of the seven words I was told never to put in my column.\n\nHe got to about the middle of the sidewalk and I saw him reach up and rub his forehead.\n\n“Oh Christ,” he said. “It’s blood.”\n\nHe shined the light inside the car and announced to the girls that the man had been by himself.\n\nThe neighbors stood around for a moment but they got cold and were perhaps embarrassed to listen to this song while standing beside a neighbor they really didn’t know very well. Anyway, they said goodnight and went back home.\n\nThe music was incessant but Joe wasn’t about to climb into the crime scene and attempt to turn that brutal noise off. So he stood there staring at the wrecked car. It was a late-model Camaro — bright red and still sending out clouds of steam.\n\nWith all this commotion, I forgot about the rat, mostly. In my experience rodents piddle then take off as soon as there is any sign of humans approaching. Still, there are few things as tasty as a warm rat liver – which as you might expect is lost on humans.\n\nJoe rubbed his forehead again and noticed how sticky it was, but he stood looking at the wrecked car mesmerized by its obnoxious intrusion into the once quiet night.\n\nWith events as traumatic and unexpected as this, it’s important to take a time-out, sit quietly and review the facts.\n\nIt’s 2:30 in the morning.\n\nThere’s no one around but Joe.\n\nAn upside down Camaro is sitting in front of Joe’s house with its lights and music still on.\n\nThe police are on their way.\n\nAnd Joe’s bleeding.\n\nAbout five minutes later, a police car pulled up (Code 2) and noticed Joe.\n\n“We’re going to block off the street,” he told Joe from the patrol car. He spoke in that wide-awake tone common to people who regularly work a night shift. Two more squad cars showed up. The latter two positioned themselves with their lights spinning at either end of the block and diverted any further traffic.\n\nJoe stood on the sidewalk watching the policemen do their stuff. Because the driver’s side of the Camaro was resting against the parked cars it had side swiped, no one could get to the controls to turn off the lights and music. So everyone had to endure the ordeal.\n\n“Looks like he got too close to one of those parked cars and then overcompensated and that flipped him,” the officer said matter-of-factly as he walked over to Joe and thankfully didn’t flash a light in my owner's face.\n\n“I’ve called for a flat bed,” the cop said. “Did you see what he looked like?”\n\nJoe described a guy in his 20s or 30s, medium build, wearing black.\n\nAs they chatted and waited around, the Camaro's battery started to die and the officer told Joe that he should go back inside.\n\nWhen I saw Joe heading in, I thought that it was time for me to go in as well. By the time Joe got into the living room, I was at the back door and he let me in.\n\nI could tell Joe was wide awake now. I watched him wash the blood off his face and then turn the TV on — shark week!\n\nSo we sat together on the bed for about a half hour.\n\nThen we both jumped up as someone knocked on the door.\n\nJoe went to open it and I went under the kitchen table.\n\nIt was the police officer who first came to the scene.\n\n“I saw your lights on and I thought I’d give you an update,” he said. “Our call center just heard from someone who appeared to be very out of breath. The guy said, ‘Somebody … ahh huh ahh huh ahh huh … just stole my car.’” He laughed.\n\n“We think it’s rather suspicious because usually when someone steals a car they drive away from the place where they stole the car rather than head right back to where they took the car from,” he said.\n\nThey both laughed and the officer said, “The wrecker’s on its way and we’ll clean up the street after we get it flipped back over and loaded up.”\n\n“Thanks,” said Joe and they said “Goodnight.”\n\nWe went back to the bedroom and the sharks were biting people right through the steel cages. It was a repeat of a program we’d seen before. Joe peeked through the window and watched as the tow company flipped the car over using a winch. They pulled it up on the flatbed, secured it, got out some brooms and cleaned up all the broken glass. The workers waved goodbye to the police and everyone left.\n\nThe street was quiet again.\n\nThe next day Joe and I went outside to get the newspaper and examine the smashed parked cars. Joe looked in the gutter and found a baseball. It must have rolled out of the upside down Camaro.\n\nWhen the neighbors who owned the cars that got hit came out to talk to Joe, they said they had slept through the entire episode, but I don’t see how. Now their two cars had smashed sides. They just shrugged their shoulders and Joe handed them the baseball and said he was sorry.\n\nWe walked slowly back to the house and I noticed Joe looking at the front garden and groaning.\n\nHere’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 10\n\nOrnamental grasses, Persian carpet tassels\n\nYou may remember Joe groaning about the front flower bed at the end of last week’s column. This spot has been a challenge for him since he bought the house 23 years ago as it gets no sunlight and the choices of shade-loving plants are limited. He has placed in that dirt several different botanical specimens over the years.\n\nImpatiens was the first. They’re easy to grow, spread quickly, show an attractive color swatch, but need to be watered and weeded regularly throughout the season. They are quickly killed by the first frost. Then came the ten rhododendrons. These were expensive and caused him to have high hopes for huge fuchsia-colored blossoms sitting on top of a tall evergreen forest of attractive leaves. For three years, however, they sat there barely hanging on, producing no new leaves and even fewer flowers. One by one, they died. He got fed up and yanked the remaining two or three out. Their roots had never bothered to test Salinas’ sweet but rather dense adobe soil. Remember, they once built houses out of this stuff.\n\nThen came the “easy-to-care-for” ornamental grasses. He had selected several types, the common names for which were rainbow grass, fountain grass, feather reedgrass, Japanese forest grass and one or two others. They looked great for two years but eventually got so long and thick they invaded each other and started flopping all over the place. They even spread under the sidewalk and populated areas where they weren’t welcome. One of those varieties even had viable seeds so the lawn was never the same again. Most withered with the first cold snap and turned the front garden into Baghdad after a bombing. They truly needed to be cut back.\n\nSo Joe got out his trash can, sharpened his shears and pulled on his gloves. He started at the side walk end, grabbed a bunch of the 3- to 4-foot-tall grass with the feather-like seed pods on the end, and vigorously started snipping at the base. He only had to do this for about 3 minutes when he noticed agitation in the mound before him. Something was stirring inside the thick grass.\n\nThen, a slow moving white paw emerged from the stems and suddenly swatted his glove. It disappeared back into the mound of long leaves. Joe smiled and continued his pruning.\n\nThe next bunch of grass he grabbed had the most thrilling and fully formed plumes one could pray for. Again, that mysterious white paw came through the thick grass and swiped his gloved hand. He chuckled and continued slicing away at the clump and tossing the dead grass into the recycle container.\n\nJoe was pulling together the next handful of coarse stems when the phantom paw once again intruded his space. Quickly, he dropped the shears and pinched it hard.\n\nIt was my foot!\n\nI let out my best Ninja scream, “urrrr RAYANG gerrrr,” flew three feet into the air, one paw extended and the other cocked back and ready to inflict serious damage on my opponent.\n\nAll Joe could do was laugh hysterically. I landed firmly on the mound, back hips held up high, head and front paws down low on the ground, growling and swaying side-to-side ready for my next death-inflicting attack.\n\nJoe now was guffawing with tears in his eyes. He was holding his stomach and groaning with laughter. My prey distracted, I decided to pounce. So I leaped into the air and managed a four-paw landing on his arm — claws retracted, of course. Then, I darted away. I was glad I could so easily amuse this man.\n\nI thought I better go hide again as here was Joe laying sprawled out on the ground in the front yard laughing uncontrollably. He was in full view of the neighborhood. Not that I cared much about people’s opinion but I was in a certain manner worried for him. They take people away and lock them up for observation for less than this. It’s called 5150 in police jargon. He might indeed be a danger to himself.\n\nWhen he regained his composure, he looked about for me and I was sitting on a rock over in the sun. He teased me with a rather long specimen of feather-top grass and I couldn’t resist. We played for about five minutes then I got tired of jumping up and down and demolishing the strands of grass and Joe sighed again and looked at the bed only a quarter of which had been cleaned out.\n\nThen I got sad as Joe continued to hack down more grass. I couldn’t pretend I was a Bengal tiger out there anymore but I understood that winter was coming and the garden needed to be tidied up before the rains started.\n\nFrom this little event Joe became convinced that one could not claim to be a true garden enthusiast without having a cat by one’s side. Plants grow better with a cat wandering around among them. It’s a known fact.\n\nI loved the front yard and enjoyed it being a sort of crossroads. I played at being a school guard watching and protecting the children who walk by going to class every morning. They were very regular and I like that — walked one way just before 8 a.m. and walked the other way sometime after 2 p.m. I usually missed the return journey as it conflicts with my sleep time.\n\nFor all of Joe’s good nature in nature, I can’t say that he laughed much when I tried a few ninja maneuvers in the house.\n\nIt was relatively soon after I started to spend more time indoors that I got my first true scolding.\n\nJoe was cooking and doing dishes at the sink in the kitchen. I wanted to play and noticed that his Persian carpet under the dining room table had these long tassels — sort of like the feather top grass I loved. Well, I laid down on my side and grabbed a fist full of tassels in my front paws and used my back ones to rip at the ones down there.\n\n“Hey,” Joe shouted, “Cut that out.”\n\nI stopped, jumped up and walked to the kitchen door. Joe paid no attention. I sat still for a moment watching him chop vegetables but quickly got bored. I then turned my head. My eyes fell on the fringe and I had to dive for it. Once again, I was on my side, hooked on with my front and scratching as fast as I could with back legs.\n\n“Dammit, I said stop that,” Joe yelled but I paid no attention and continued. Suddenly, I was hit in the face with a wet dish rag which was quite a messy shock. So I ran behind the couch and hid. I watched Joe pick up the towel and toss it back in the sink.\n\nI don’t know. I just don’t know. I suppose if there was a cat equivalent of thumb-sucking, bed-wetting, nail-biting in humans; there was a rug fringe annihilating in cats.\n\nYep. Joe’s back in the kitchen. I’m behind the couch. I look out. I see tassels. Vavoom — I’m on ‘em and trying my best to rip ‘em to shreds.\n\n“You little sh*t!” Joe said in his lowest and meanest voice. He ran over to me, grabbed me by my scruff, and slapped my head soundly. “What did I tell you?”\n\nI wailed.\n\nMiserable groans came from deep inside me and my whole body shook. He didn’t actually hit me very hard but it was more how startled I was that I reached his limit. I also felt bad about not being able to control myself and that I had disappointed Joe. I stood in the middle of the living room and cried out loud.\n\nThis outburst took Joe quite by surprise and soon he was next to me, picking me up and sitting me on his lap. He started in about how sorry he was but I just kept crying.\n\nLater, I overheard Joe tell his friends he was doing his best “not to laugh” because I was behaving so much like a two-year-old.\n\nWell folks, you do the math!\n\nWhile I was sitting on Joe’s lap and he was soothing me he noticed my fur. Now that winter was coming and I would be in the house more, I might have to be a little cleaner. He decided he needed to know more about cats and baths.\n\nSo here’s what he did next … to be continued.\n\nColumn 11\n\nRub-a-dub-dub, bad advice\n\nI was sleeping in the sun on the patio, dreaming of a land of endless delights where tuna water ran in the streams, dishes were full of crunchy treats, and all the plants in the garden smelled of intrigue. I heard the patio door slide open and watched Joe approach through one half-opened eye. He got closer and I opened both eyes. He reached down and lifted me up, kissed the top of my head, and then looked at my feet and hind legs. OK, they were a little muddy.\n\nJoe carried me into the house with his arms extended and my hind legs dangling. His voice continuously making soothing sounds. We turned the corner and entered the bathroom. The shower curtain was pulled to one side. A stack of towels rested on the vanity. A bottle of flea shampoo was on the bathtub rim. The tub was full of warm water. I knew what was coming and let out a low, sad groan.\n\nSplash! Into the water I was plunged and immediately fought against this indignant and terrifying ordeal. But Joe’s got big hands and they were not going to let go no matter how much of the bath water I was able to swish out of the tub and onto him. His hands are so large just one of them can hold me tightly while the other dumped this awful smelling shampoo on my neck and back.\n\n“Oooo,” he said, “You’re gonna smell so nice and clean.”\n\nThat’s no consolation, no comfort. I cried in that low and pathetic tone cats muster when escape is out of the question.\n\n“We just can’t have you bringing all that mud in the house. Can we?” he asked.\n\nThe shampoo and water did their trick and I was now covered in foamy wet fur. Joe massaged and scrubbed and rinsed and scrubbed some more and all the shampoo he dumped on me kept foaming and foaming up.\n\nI wriggled and writhed and managed up stir up a bath tub tsunami which hit its target dead on.\n\nJoe drained the tub as the bath water was now filthy, foamy and thick with hair. OK, I was shedding a bit but he would not let go of me however much I fought. He managed to turn the bathtub tap on and test it. Then, he used his free hand to cup the water and splash it up against me to rinse out the foam. This took too long. So he held on to me with two hands moved me right under the gushing spigot. I remember wriggling a lot but not much else.\n\nHe paused for a moment to notice how tiny my body actually is when I’m soaking wet.\n\n“OK, Bud, we’re nearly done now.”\n\nHe turned off the water tap and using his hand like a squeegee, he put me through the spin cycle.\n\nReaching behind him, he grabbed a fluffy towel and covered me with it.\n\nIn one quick motion, he lifted me and the towel up, grabbed the other towels and walked back out to the patio. One towel absorbed most of the water. The second one quickly twirled over me and the third sat on his legs.\n\nSlowly Joe moved the towel up and down my back trying to dry my fur off. All four legs and paws got a good rubbing as did my head, neck, belly and backside. Throughout this procedure I was quiet and patient and even purred softly.\n\nJoe replaced the second towel with a dry fourth one and vigorously rubbed me all over. That’s when I started my low growl. When he was rough with my back legs which are sensitive, I hissed and spit in his face.\n\nHe put me down on the patio and picked up the wet towels. Joe was now wetter than I was. I sat in the sun for a few minutes rearranging my fur.\n\nJoe appeared on the patio with a bowl of fish-flavored treats wearing an entirely new set of clothes.\n\nLater in the day, he kept picking me up, hugging me, sticking his nose into my fur and breathing deep.\n\n“You smell so delicious,” he said. Little compensation for the torture I endured.\n\nWeeks passed.\n\nA co-worker of Joe’s who had owned cats his entire life was sympathetic when Joe related to him how difficult my first bath was to carry off. This person must have been testing Joe’s gullibility more than sharing practical advice.\n\nThis happened. It really did. In fact, it’s a primary reason why I thought writing this column might be good — a sort of public service warning about what not to do.\n\nHere goes.\n\nThe garden was wet after a lengthy early morning rain. I was outside and particularly bored. I wanted to play. A fat rat proved to be the right vehicle for my entertainment. Off I went on its trail. The hunt, however, brought me into direct contact with terra not-so-firma. It was pretty mucky out back. I admit so was I and I gave up.\n\nJoe was finishing his first cup of coffee so it was early. He noticed me trying to wash myself on the patio and how muddy I was.\n\n“C’mon Bud,” Joe said, “Let’s take a shower together.” That was the “friend’s” advice!\n\nJoe picked me up, carried me into the bathroom and placed me on the sink countertop. I watched him take off his T-shirt and running shorts and hang them on the hook behind the door which he closed. He reached behind the curtain, turned on the water and adjusted the temperature. Then swung around and picked me up.\n\nHe was as cheerful as ever, “We’re going to have a nice warm shower.”\n\nI knew where this was going and saw shock and awe written all over it. I gave him no assurance I was going to go quietly. I growled and hissed. Still he pressed me against his warm chest, pulled the curtain back, and into the tub he stepped closing the curtain behind us.\n\n“Here we go,” he said and stepped forward into the shower spray.\n\nThe moment the first drop of water touched my ear, my claws went directly into Joe’s flesh. He screamed. My back paws dug into Joe’s belly and gave me enough of a ledge to jump up onto his head with my hind legs digging into his shoulders and my front ones buried deeply into his scalp. I completely obscured his face and he staggered about in the stream of water — my belly smack up against his cheeks.\n\nJoe, poor guy, was not only startled by the suddenness of these events but was now also blind and in considerable pain.\n\nHe turned quickly to try and pull me off his head but unfortunately his knee hit the shower’s “On” lever and turned the tap to cold.\n\nI decided he was no longer stable — hmmmm! — and I wasn’t going to go down with the ship. So I jumped for the rod holding up the shower curtain. It’s only mounted there by a pressure coil. Once hit by a 10-pound soaking wet, very angry feline, it’s coming down.\n\nAnd down it went.\n\nI road it like a surfer until it crashed into the toilet tank knocking a soap dish onto the floor and box of tissue into toilet. I leaped onto the sink counter but slid across it and toppled over the toothbrush holder sending the toothbrushes and toothpaste onto the now soaking wet rug. Then, I jumped down to the floor and hid in the corner by the door.\n\nJoe stood naked in the tub shivering and bleeding. He turned the water off and looked down at the scratches and muddy paw prints on his chest, arms and shoulders. He touched his sore scalp. It was bleeding and throbbing.\n\nThe entire bathroom looked like Katrina had blown through. A soaking wet shower curtain covered half the mess. Even the towels which he had so carefully stacked to dry me off were sodden with the spray from the shower head.\n\nJoe looked at the clock. It was 12 to 8. He sighed deeply, bent over and lifted up the shower curtain and rod. He adjusted the pressure coil inside the rod and rehung the curtain. Turned the water back on and took a long and steamy shower. When he finished, he found a partially dry towel, put his clothes back on and started putting things in order.\n\nHe lifted me up, wiped the mud off my paws with a wet towel and dried me with a little hand towel that was saved from the downpour. He opened the door and I ran out to the patio again. The sun was now up and I found a warm place to finish drying off.\n\nHe was very distant for the rest of the day and kept the doors shut.\n\nAround suppertime, he opened the sliding door and offered me some kibbles — Fancy Feast’s Filet Mignon and Shrimp flavor — the best.\n\nAnd here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 12\n\nA Good Luck Symbol\n\nThe best thing Joe did, and this holds true to this very day, is stop taking advice from other cat owners.\n\nI loved being outside and, when it was truly miserable weather, I joined Joe inside. If he wasn’t around and I was inside, I just slept the day away and made certain I didn’t disrupt anything.\n\nAny project Joe might get involved in, I was right there offering interest, encouragement and occasionally sympathy — he wasted a lot of time on projects that didn’t quite work out. Take for example the organizer for nuts, bolts, nails and screws that he made out of empty baby food jars. He thought I might enjoy “baby’s first meal.” But I immediately tried to bury that crap and he gave up on trying to feed it to me. The organizer worked for awhile but the threads on the lids got too loose and with the weight of the contents fell down on their own. They scared me to death when they dropped and made Joe think I was somehow responsible.\n\nOne day, we were pulling weeds from under a rose bush when one fell down of its own accord and proved my innocence.\n\nMy favorite of Joe’s creations were the ditches he dug around his rose beds in the back yard. He told folks that he made them to add vertical interest to the garden beds. But, truthfully, he created these trenches to facilitate drainage. When he moved into his house, his back yard was much lower than his front. It was even lower than his neighbors’ yards which adjoined it. Every time one of those wet storms came down from Alaska, the backyard flooded. The clay soil turned to muck and stayed wet and soggy for days. So over the years, Joe hauled in mulch and top dressing, wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow, to cover the garden beds — and elevate them. The ditches, too, had to be maintained to make certain they were deep enough for the water to flow out, around the side of the house, into the front yard and down into the street.\n\nDuring most of the dry year, however, these little arroyos were a perfect place for me to hide. The birds at the feeder in the middle of the lawn were never expecting an attack from the ditch.\n\nJoe learned how to find me by scanning the edge of the green lawn looking for one white ear and one black ear sticking up.\n\nI’d mentioned Old Wes before. He was the fellow who lives next door to Joe. He, too, lives by himself but unlike Joe, he is home all day long. Best thing about Wes and his yard is the absence of dogs and other cats. There was just me, and then only as an afternoon visitor. Wes didn’t mind me stopping by to see him as he sat on his patio reading the newspaper. As soon as someone came to visit him, though, I took off. I wasn’t interested in knowing any more human beings.\n\nIt was Wes who told Joe about my unusual bird hunting technique. I’d sit up on the roof and wait for the spitzies to fly between the houses. Sparrows and finches always look down when they fly, searching for food or a decent place to land. So I’d time my leap from the eaves just perfectly and hit them from above, hold onto them with my jaws and land on all fours in front of Wes. That impressed him.\n\nOf course, I don’t recommend this to your cats as many of those six- and seven-foot landings have eaten up eight of my nine lives. Ouch!\n\nMy hind legs are close to useless these days. I’m so stiff I can’t even twist around to groom myself. I still moan and groan during the baths which are much more frequent now because they have to be, but Joe is also much better at giving them. He uses off-brand baby shampoo which is easier to rinse off in the tub and still makes me smell fresh. He no longer wastes $48 on 8 ounces of specialized feline dandruff reduction shampoo.\n\nMoney means something to Joe. I’ve always felt its only value was to make life more comfortable right here, right now. Humans place importance on things of value.\n\nOne night, Joe was watching another of his nature programs on TV. This one was particularly riveting for him as it was all about cats! He learned about our relatively late domestication. Dogs, horses, and cows have us cats beat by several millennia. He saw film clips of our closest relatives —Asian wild cats — and our recent explosion of popularity, overtaking our rivals in the pet world. You know who.\n\nJoe listened carefully as the program’s narrator, in dark and deep tones, recited a list of breeds with representational photos.\n\n“Through the course of the domestication of the house cat,” the narrator noted, “man has used his breeding talent to create and accentuate certain feline characteristics. This has resulted in the creation of several distinct breeds whose characteristics fit a predetermined standard. Most popular are the Siamese, the Persian, the Abyssinian. There’s also the Russian blue, Maine coon, Cornish Rex, and … Japanese bobtail.”\n\nJoe’s jaw dropped.\n\n“Japanese bobtail!” He’d never heard of that breed before, had never seen a picture of this ancient type of Oriental house cat. The show ended.\n\nImmediately, Joe turned off the TV and fired up his computer. He did a quick search of Japanese bobtail on the internet and pulled up a photo gallery featuring pictures of them. He was stunned as he looked through the photos.\n\n“Buddy,” was all he uttered.\n\nHe ran to the back bedroom where I had fallen sound asleep — well, with Joe around, I wouldn’t call any of my sleep truly sound. At any rate, he lifted me up, carried me over to the computer and set me on the desktop.\n\nHe looked at the screen and read, “Eyes more oval than round.”\n\nLooked me in the face, “Yep,” he said.\n\nReturned to the screen, “Ears wide apart and standing straight at 45 degrees to the face,”\n\n“That too,” he said.\n\n“Back legs a little longer than front ones.”\n\nHe pulled me around and tugged on my legs, “Got it,” he said.\n\n“Predominantly white with black or calico spots, but could be any color.”\n\n“Definitely,” he nodded.\n\n“Very vocal.”\n\n“Bud can’t keep his mouth shut,” he whispered.\n\n“The bobtail usually has anything from a stub to a short tail with a kink.”\n\nHe felt mine.\n\n“Stub,” he said.\n\nThat was enough pokin’ ‘n’ proddin’ for me. I struggled and Joe let me jump down. I headed outside and he kept on reading.\n\n“Brought to this country from Japan in 1968. Quickly became popular. Ancient breed of street cat in Japan. The calico, called ‘mi-ke,’ is most prized. The breed features in a legend that runs more or less like this. It was said that once a man was eating at a restaurant and spotted a Japanese bobtail outside. The cat stared at him intensely and raised its front paw. The man got up to see the cat and scratch its head. Just as he touched the cat, the heavy wooden beam above the chair where he was sitting gave way and came crashing down.”\n\nThank you Mr. Cat.\n\nThe Japanese bobtail is that friendly ceramic, paw-raised cat that sits on check-out counters at Chinese and Japanese restaurants. It’s a symbol of good luck. Sometimes with a clock in its belly, sometimes with a mechanical paw that waves hello. It was also the inspiration for the ‘Hello Kitty’ image.\n\nJoe poked around on the internet and found a breeder with an 831 telephone number. That dealer listed Japanese bobtail kittens on her website at $600 a piece!\n\nWhen next he saw me, Joe lifted me up, stared into my face and said, “You’re worth $600, Buddy boy!”\n\nHis entire demeanor toward me changed. He next showed up with a new stiff metal brush, a soft nylon brush, a flea comb, and several more catnip stuffed mice toys.\n\nAt work, Joe told everyone including people who hate cats that his cat was a “Japanese bobtail.”\n\nFrom this time forward, he rarely referred to me as a cat. When asked by some new acquaintance if he owned a pet, Joe would say, “Yes, I have a Japanese bobtail.” If they looked bewildered — unsure exactly what type of animal that might be, he added, “That’s an ancient breed of cat.”\n\nIf given any encouragement, he’d also add, “He’s worth at least $600.”\n\nNow that my monetary value had been established, Joe didn’t feel so bad about spending the $48 on that ritzy cat dandruff shampoo.\n\n“Just taking care of the investment,” he bragged.\n\n“Investment!” I thought. This fellow does not remember history.\n\nAnd here’s what he did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 13\n\nThe remodel and a surprise visitor\n\nDuring the first dozen years Joe lived in his house in Salinas, he thought about remodeling his kitchen. His approach was methodical. He sought advice from many friends and knowledgeable people. He jotted down a list of “must-haves” and looked at several home improvement magazines — when I wasn’t sound asleep on top of them. He knew exactly what he hated and would never have in his house, but he wavered a lot on what should happen and when. He knew what shabby things he had to improve but wasn’t certain about the materials or appliances to put into the newly designed kitchen. This would have been 2004 and the offers of home equity loans seemed endless and cheap.\n\nOne of the first consultants to come to our house was Mr. Wayne Dilbeck of Dilbeck & Sons Construction in Salinas. Mr. Dilbeck’s headquarters were located near the storage unit of Joe’s former employer, just off West Rossi Street. So he decided to get in touch with them and was happy when Mr. Dilbeck himself arranged a visit. Joe was thrilled to have such a knowledgeable and experienced man help him.\n\nIt was probably on a Saturday — that’s a tiring day as most of the neighborhood cats are out late the night before, especially when there’s a full moon. I’m always confused at home because that’s the day when everything is off schedule. Joe’s always running about the house and yard doing things, coming and going in his truck, and running the washing machine which is loud and scares me. People occasionally drop by unannounced — at least to me.\n\nAt any rate, Joe’s truck was in the driveway. A much larger truck with a rack over the bed was in front of the house. The garage door was wide open. I’d been out most of the night snooping around the neighborhood picking fights with a couple of ferals who claimed they didn’t know my yard was private property and it took me longer to finish smelling the neighbors' tires. I was exhausted and decided on a short cut.\n\nI heard talk coming from the kitchen and walked into the garage. When I finished checking out that space under the cupboards for rats and mice, I was ready to go indoors.\n\nJoe was chatting with Wayne Dilbeck. The windowless door from the kitchen to the garage was closed shut. I just didn’t have the energy to walk around, climb a fence and deposit myself onto a patio chair.\n\n“I’d like to put in a garden window,” I heard Joe say.\n\n“That’s a standard size space and we can make it fit,” the other voice (Wayne’s) replied.\n\n“When I make coffee and toast at the same time, I blow a fuse,” Joe said.\n\n“Yea, all of the electricity has to be redone to bring it up to code,” Wayne answered.\n\n“Errrr raing,” I interjected from my side of the door.\n\nThey paused.\n\nJoe continued, “I’d like to put in a disposal.”\n\n“That’s easy,” Wayne said, “but we’ll have to take a look at the plumbing. Houses in this neighborhood were built with all the pipes in the concrete slab and that’s not ….”\n\n“Errrr RAING,” I said firmly, thinking maybe they hadn’t heard me.\n\nJoe paid no attention to me and continued talking, “Now, one of the things I want most is a light above the sink. I hate doing dishes in the shadows.”\n\n“ER RAING guh,” I snapped.\n\n“All the electrical will have to be redone, so you can have …” Wayne started and stopped.\n\n“RAING RAING RAING,” I shouted.\n\n“Now let’s talk about counter tops,” Joe said clearly ignoring me, “should I choose granite or something else?”\n\nExasperated, I screamed, “ERRRR RAING GUUUUH.”\n\n“Joe,” Wayne said softly, “I think your cat wants in.”\n\nReluctantly, and a bit embarrassed about my behavior, Joe opened the kitchen door. I slowly stepped inside, looked straight ahead, paid no attention to either men, walked between them, turned the corner and headed out on the patio. I could feel two sets of eyes following me.\n\nTheir conversation lasted another 15 minutes or so and then Wayne said goodbye, got in his truck and drove away.\n\nJoe locked the house and drove away, too.\n\nA few hours later, Joe returned with a package under his arm. It was something called a “Kitty Entrance” and it was supposed to fit snugly next to a sliding door.\n\nWhat began next was Joe’s effort to train me to use a pet door. I understood the concept and walked freely in and out through it — as long as Joe held the flap open for me and there was a treat on the other side.\n\nAs soon as he started pushing my head against that swinging door, my legs flew out straight in front of me, locked into position against the frame, and would not budge. I did not see why I had to push my head against a piece of plastic. Joe was always available to me for that purpose. The game I invented became let’s see how long I can wait before I put my stiff legs out.\n\nVarious incentives — feathered toys, tuna water, treats: hard and soft — were placed before me which I sincerely enjoyed — as long as Joe held that little door open.\n\nJoe tried again a bit later that day and a couple of times more the following day. He was deflated because he thought he could train me to do anything. What I knew that Joe hadn’t quite figured out yet was that he himself likes to come and go freely through this door. The insert fell down every time he swung the glass sliding door open.\n\nIt, the cat door, was soon relegated to a shelf in the garage where I remember sitting on top of it a few times. I don’t know what ever happened to it though in the end.\n\nAnyway, months passed before the remodeling began. I heard Joe say that Mr. Dilbeck was getting so much business he had a hard time fitting us in anytime soon. But, I won’t forget his teaching Joe that immediate cat needs take precedent over dreams of new kitchens.\n\nThe folks from Salinas Valley Appliances which, alas, is no more, showed up, worked with Joe, drew up plans and began destroying the old kitchen.\n\nIn the midst of all these disruptions, Joe had moved the large living room furniture against a far wall, hauled the dining room table and chairs into the back bedroom, rolled up the carpeting and covered everything in bed sheets. It was so much fun to play in that open space and to be able to sit on the top shelf of the bookcase, I just can’t tell you.\n\nIt was during this time. I think it was a Saturday morning again because Joe was home and saw for himself what happened. The kitchen was nearly finished and they were getting ready to repaint the living and dining room. I just happened to be looking out of the picture window into the front yard, when out from the bushes guess who I saw staring back at me?\n\nMy old man!\n\nI’d thought I’d smelled his stink a few days earlier but couldn’t be certain. It had been three years since I left that old lair of his. Now here he was as ugly and pompous as ever. And on the prowl\n\nKnow what he did? He hissed and spit at me. What a greeting!\n\nKnow what I did back? From my side of the window? I snarled and roared as powerfully as I could muster. I had the benefit of the empty room and its echo chamber. What a volume I mustered! It caused his eyes to pop out and he trembled. Ha!\n\n“Look on my might works ye mighty and despair,” I quoted.\n\nJoe came flying into the room amid my growling and roaring to see what was up and saw my tail-less, yellow, mangy papa take off running across the front lawn and down the street, never to be seen again.\n\nHere’s what Joe did next ... to be continued\n\nColumn 14\n\nBrooms & exercise\n\nSurprised at seeing a tailless yellow cat at his front picture window and hearing me growling like the king of beasts, Joe stepped out of the front door and I followed closely behind. My old man was heading west on Chaparral Street and we watched him race down the sidewalk. He disappeared in some bushes on the corner of Maryal Drive. I raced over to the liquid amber tree near the curb, sharpened my claws energetically on its trunk and sprinted back into the house passing in front of Joe and winning the gold medal.\n\nMy pop’s surprise visit coincided with one of Joe’s exercise periods. I’ve lived through six of these heart healthy episodes, which usually occurred just before and just after Joe visits his doctor. Joe seemed proud of keeping his numbers down — during those periods.\n\nThat evening, Joe put on some walking shoes and a sweatshirt, locked the house, and headed west. He was thinking again of my old man and wondering where that mean cuss might be holed up these days. I was of no help because I’ve got my own territory to supervise and haven’t strayed very far from the rose garden.\n\nNorth Main Street is too noisy for a contemplative walk so Joe turned onto Noice and headed toward Laurel Drive. Somewhere along this stretch of his exercise route his eyes fell on a gray cat sitting on the top step of one of the houses.\n\nJoe stopped dead in his tracks and stared. The cat looked so much like me. Joe waited. It got up and walked across the front porch. NO TAIL! This cat was predominantly an ash color but had some black and white markings, the same length of fur, the same shape of head and body, and (I’m bragging, please indulge me) the same intelligent eyes. It even returned his stare with a short little “meow,” just like I do all the time.\n\nNo scaredy cats in my family! I’m convinced the cat was my long lost sister. I was thrilled to hear Joe tell his friends about her. He also saw the dirty abandoned garage I once called home. (My handmade quilts are much more comfortable than that greasy ol’ torn towel that was our communal bed and Joe’s hand thrown pottery dishes are certainly steps above the garbage can lid that was our joint trough — even though one or two of Joe’s bowls are a bit lop sided.)\n\nIn subsequent walks, Joe noticed a few other cats wandering in and out of that garage but he never saw my sister again. Each time he peeped about that old lady’s property he saw cats he’d never seen before.\n\nThat was years ago now and the last time Joe walked by that house, maybe last Christmas, the curtains were all pulled shut and the garage door was closed tight. The broken patio furniture was gone. No sign of any cats.\n\nLet’s go back to the remodeled kitchen.\n\nA few days after we chased my dad out of the yard, it was time to put the house back in order. I stayed outside mostly because of the smell of the new paint. But when Joe started moving the furniture back into position I felt I owed him the courtesy of my helping paws and chased the edges of the sheets that covered the chairs and sofa.\n\nDuring this major reshuffling, Joe went to the garage and returned with an old-fashioned straw broom. At seeing it, I panicked and ran toward the door to the patio, but when I got there it was closed. I reversed engines and darted behind the couch trying my best to crawl under it.\n\nJoe stood there with his mouth open and was totally confused. There had never been any episode that involved him, me, and a broom. What could have caused such a panic attack in Buddy, he wondered. He slowly walked over to the sliding door with the broom still in his hand, opened it and moved aside. I recoiled a bit and then darted right through the opening and was soon out on the back lawn and over the fence. Free at last!\n\nThe churning in Joe’s head continued for the remainder of that day. He was sweeping up the lint, dust, and assorted rose leaves and petals that had blown into the house; wiping off the mantle, bookcase shelves and end tables with a damp cloth; and rehanging the lithographs on his walls.\n\nSuddenly, he stopped. His synapses connected and threw him back a couple of years to a comment made by his first cleaning lady — now long since gone. It was a forgotten memory. She was two departed housekeepers back. Her comment finally had significance.\n\nIt went like this, “Kitty-cat no good in house. Kitty-cat go outside. Kitty-cat STAY outside.”\n\nOh, this particular cleaning lady never hurt me with the broom, but she certainly threatened me with it on several occasions, especially that one time when I came in from the garden and my paws were a bit “dusty.” All I did was walk across a wet kitchen floor checking to see if she had mopped up all of the evil smells. She hadn’t quite done that but my inspection was interrupted by the broom smacking me in the rear.\n\nJoe smiled. To this day, I’ve hated the sight of a broom. The vacuum cleaner is another matter. It’s just way too loud. I exit to the garden and wait until it’s quiet again. So I have issues with a few things but they’re minor to my other abilities.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of me, I should also mention another of what Joe describes as my awesome talents. My hearing! I think I’ve mentioned before I can hear a rat scratching from 50 feet away and I can.\n\nIt totally freaks Joe out though when we’re sitting quietly and he’s watching TV and I’m taking a nap and I suddenly do this. I’ll bolt upright, tilt my head and stare toward the front door. Joe notices me, and then the doorbell rings. Meanwhile, Joe hasn’t heard a footstep.\n\nThis has happened several times and Joe continues to be amazed. The postman drops letters in the mailbox, high school band members are selling candy bars, strangers want to talk about home security systems, or evangelicals are inviting him to their congregation. Through it all, I’m right there giving him a signal, someone’s coming!\n\nGiven my extraordinary hearing, Joe finds the reverse side of it aggravating.\n\nHe’ll say “Get out of the way!” to me and I’ll continue to stay in the middle of his path. He’ll say “Buddy, come here quick” and I’ll maybe stare at him, maybe not. He’ll say “OK Bud, it’s time for you to go outside,” and I’ll sigh and close my eyes.\n\nIf this article is about true confessions, I did miss my “someone’s coming” cue just one time, but it was in the middle of the night and, well very serious ...\n\nThis is what happened … to be continued\n\nColumn 15\n\nNight visitors and a wounding insult\n\nJoe had been busy straightening up the house for the entire day. Company was coming. He had invited several people from his office to come over for Halloween which was the following evening.\n\nThe caveat to attending one of Joe’s Halloween parties was this. He would provide dinner and drinks but guests were required to bring all the candy for the hundreds of trick-or-treaters who were inevitably coming to the door. Guests would then help to pass out the candy. No costumes for the guests were required which seemed to delight all of them.\n\nI’ve written about my first costume which was a cowboy. My second costume — and I’m not making this up — was a “show girl.” I’d warned you all about that bejeweled collar reappearing around my neck. This costume he created had a circle of colorful feathers mounted on it and I was supposed to prance Las Vegas-style around the room with my head framed by all these long feathers. Fortunately, gravity was on my side so the weight of the top feathers kept circling around my neck and ending up at my feet making it tricky to walk at all. It wasn’t successful. Joe tried to fix it once or twice and then just gave up and took it off me. There is a God.\n\nAfter I greeted everyone and allowed folks to “ooo” and “ah” over my extraordinary handsomeness and generally gregarious nature, I retired to the bedroom for the remainder of the night. The guests by this time were busy coming and going as were the hundreds of children and their parents who came to the door.\n\nMany kids picked Chaparral Street to walk down because it was flat, non-stop houses from Natividad Road to North Main Street, and most importantly, Sandra, my neighbor about seven houses away, and her family carved 50 or so gigantic pumpkins and invited everyone to walk about them on the front lawn and enjoy the great carving job and the candles. It was a wonderful and generous gesture on their part. They worked in the produce business and had access to these giant pumpkins. Some were three or four feet tall! It was such a special treat for many and I enjoyed hearing about them but there was never time for me to see them for myself. Sandra’s husband became sick one year and the jack-o-lantern period ended.\n\nJoe’s guests loved to come over to see the pumpkins, to enjoy the children’s costumes and to get together over good food and wine.\n\nBut I’m getting way ahead of myself.\n\nJoe was cleaning all day and preparing food that could stay in the refrigerator and be ready to serve the next day. He was exhausted and frankly so was I. Watching Joe go here and there, in the garage, in the back bedroom, outside on the patio, back in the kitchen, was more tiring than you might think. He was always in a hurry making sure that when the guests arrived everything would be ready for them. A cheese board was made up, bowls of nuts were here and there, the table had its leaves put in and was pushed against a wall. Plates, glasses, napkins, utensils all were ready ahead of time so he could spend most of the next day just cooking.\n\nSo when ten or eleven came around, it was “lights out ladies and gentlemen. Time to rest.” It was also a moonless night so I had no interest in wandering the neighborhood looking for troublemakers. We both got onto the bed and fell soundly asleep.\n\nAt around 2 a.m., we heard a rap-rap-rap-rap on the front door. Joe and I jumped up and looked at each other. The knocking continued.\n\nJoe went to the peep hole in the front door and looked out. He’d left the porch light on, fortunately, and could see clearly. He spotted a badge on the arm of one of the people standing there. It read “Salinas Police Department.”\n\nJoe and I immediately sensed something bad had happened. I took off and hid under the dining room table so I could disappear from the eyes of any intruders yet still watch what was going on. Joe opened the door.\n\nImmediately the visitors began to speak.\n\n“We got a call from your wife or girlfriend that you’d had too much to drink and she was afraid you were going to beat her up,” said the uniformed police officer in one long emotionless breath. Standing next to him, was a female officer, also uniformed, and a plain-clothes detective.\n\nJoe paused for what seemed a very long moment while he stared at the law enforcement trio standing on the porch and tried to assess the situation..\n\n“Excuse me,” Joe finally mumbled still partly snoozing.\n\n“We got a call saying you were drinking too much and your wife was afraid of you,” the uniformed officer said again.\n\n“350 Chaparral Street?” Joe questioned incredulously.\n\n“Yes, that’s what she said,” he replied.\n\n“Are sure it wasn’t 350 Chardonnay Street?” Joe asked because he frequently gets mail for that address in his box.\n\n“No sir,” the officer said, “She clearly stated ‘Chaparral.’”\n\n“Maybe she meant ‘315?’” Joe answered trying to figure out the confusion.\n\nThe three members of Salinas’ finest remained at the front door unwilling to give up.\n\n“Oh, for goodness sake,” Joe said pleasantly, “C’mon in.” He reached up and turned the lights on in the living room. Then, walked over to the hallway to the bedrooms and turned those lights on. He then joined the group in the center of the living room floor. Reaching over to the sliding door he opened that as well.\n\nIn the light of the living room, the three police officers looked a bit embarrassed.\n\n“You live here alone?” the plainclothes man asked.\n\n“Uh, yes, I do,” Joe said, now fully awake and obviously not drunk, not ready to beat anybody up.\n\nThe three stood there for a moment, apparently unsure as to what to do next.\n\nThe uniformed officer, who had done the questioning, took out his flashlight and was shining it out into the black back yard.\n\n“You got a pretty nice garden out there,” he said in that alert tone most night shift workers have.\n\n“You’re all welcome to come back and take a better look … in the daytime,” Joe answered cheerfully.\n\nThe three looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders and said “Goodnight.”\n\nIf they said they were sorry for bothering us in the middle of the night, I didn’t hear it. In fact, I was furious that Joe said “Yes” to living alone question. Who the hell was I?\n\nPerhaps Joe felt that the Salinas Police Department would not have considered me important enough to mention, perhaps he was too sleepy and didn’t think of it, perhaps he thought if he did say “Just me and my cat” they might have thought he was making fun of their mistake. At any rate, I was smarting from the insult.\n\nAfter such an interruption, Joe and I had a hard time going back to sleep.

A consent decree with school officials in the east Alabama county, located on the Georgia line, the government and attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund includes construction of a new school and more opportunities for Black students in the county of roughly 35,000 people, officials said. The agreement was announced Friday to end a desegregation order that’s been in place since 1970. It followed a previous, interim agreement reached in 1993. “We are pleased to arrive at a consent decree that addresses the many concerns our clients raised as key to ensuring the effectiveness of the desegregation process in Chambers County,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund. “It was particularly important that Black students in the district are afforded equal and high-quality educational opportunities in safe and modern facilities.” Before the end of the next school year, the district must pick a site to build a new, consolidated high school to replace LaFayette High School, which is heavily Black, and Valley High School, which has a large population of white students.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had about 6,700 more jobs last month than a year earlier, but jobs in most sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the state labor department reported Friday. There were about 11,800 fewer jobs in April than in April 2019, the year before the pandemic, the department said. The biggest year-over-year gain was in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had about 3,900 more jobs last month than in April 2021. The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019. But there were 1,700 fewer jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, 1,100 fewer in leisure and hospitality, and 2,700 fewer in oil and gas last month than in April 2019. Karinne Wiebold, an economist with the department, said recently that Alaska began seeing year-over-year growth in total employment in April 2021, a year after the “initial employment shock” from the pandemic hit. She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: The city has preemptively adopted new rules regulating short-term rental properties before it welcomes a bevy of visitors for the 2023 Super Bowl. Ordinances approved by the Glendale City Council on May 10 amend the city’s codes on short-term rentals and nuisance parties. Owners of homes rented out for brief vacations must now provide contact information to the city in case law enforcement needs to reach them for an emergency or disturbance. Glendale’s ordinance additionally prohibits short-term rental properties from being used for operating as a retail enterprise or an adult-oriented business. Because Glendale currently doesn’t have a registry of short-term rental homes, local leaders say it’s difficult to know how much of a nuisance these properties are creating in the community, 12News reports. “It is possible that officers are responding to noise complaints at short-term rentals and just don’t know they are short-term rentals,” Deputy City Manager Rick St. John said during a council meeting. In another ordinance, Glendale’s police officers have the ability to assess fees to individuals hosting “nuisance parties,” or any social gathering that “constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The barrage of television ads and mailers leading up to Tuesday’s primary election makes the most influential Republicans in the state clear. Tom Cotton’s making the case for fellow U.S. Sen. John Boozman, talking up his conservative bona fides while the two-term senator fends off challenges from the right. Donald Trump’s image appears in ads for Boozman and for Sarah Sanders, who served as the ex-president’s White House press secretary and is now running for governor. Sanders, whose endorsement is almost as sought after as Trump’s, is helping make the closing argument for Boozman in a TV ad. But conspicuously missing from the ads and the campaign trail is the state’s top elected Republican, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is entering the final stretch of his term with strong approval ratings and a raised national profile. Hutchinson’s advisers say he’s concentrating on helping more Republicans nationally as he looks to the future – which might include a White House bid. Sanders has avoided publicly criticizing Hutchinson, even when her former boss labeled the outgoing governor a “RINO” – Republican in Name Only – for his decision to veto an anti-transgender law. Sanders said she would have signed the measure, which bans gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: New rules about how and when actors can use guns while filming failed to pass the Legislature on Thursday, just months after a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding went off and killed a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico. Democrats in California had filed two bills in response to the tragedy, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. With competing proposals, Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the author of one of the proposals, said he “strongly urged” entertainment industry groups to “work collaboratively to bring forward a consensus approach.” But no one did. On Thursday, Portantino decided to hold both bills in committee, meaning they are unlikely to pass the Legislature this year. “It’s a powerful and ruthless industry. First the industry killed Halyna. Then they killed the bill that would’ve made people like her safe,” said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat who authored the other proposal. Cortese’s bill would have banned the use of guns and blank ammunition containing gunpowder or other explosive charges from film sets, with some exceptions. Portantino’s bill would have allowed guns with blank ammunition on set, but only under the supervision of an armorer who has completed a state gun safety course.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A late spring snowstorm dumped several inches in the Denver metro area Saturday and knocked out electricity for about 210,000 customers, officials said. The wet snow weighed down tree branches and sent them toppling onto power lines, the television station KUSA reports. Much more snow fell in mountainous regions of Colorado. By Saturday night, power had been restored to 160,000 customers, but about 50,000 still did not have it back, the Xcel Energy Colorado utility said in a statement. The small Colorado community of Cripple Creek near the base of Pike’s Peak got 20 inches of snow, KUSA reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Eligible families can begin applying next month for the new one-year child tax rebate program that’s included in the newly revised state budget, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. Rebates of up to $250 per child are expected to be issued in late August. The rebates will be provided for up to three children per family. While any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child under the age of 18 on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible for the rebate, the amounts are dictated by income. To receive the maximum amount, the income threshold is $100,000 or less for those single or married filing separately; $169,000 or less for those filing as head of household; and $200,000 for those married filing jointly. Those with higher incomes may be eligible to receive a reduced rebate. The Department of Revenue Services will accept applications from June 1 through July 31. Families can apply online on the DRS website and click on the “2022 CT Child Tax Rebate” icon. DRS is reaching out about the program to more than 300,000 households in the state that may meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report by Amtrak’s inspector general found that the train service’s $41 million purchase of an office building in the city has failed to provide savings that were projected. Amtrak estimated it would save close to $50 million by consolidating operations in the building that it purchased in Wilmington in May 2020. But a report filed May 13 by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General found those savings haven’t materialized for a variety of reasons. Dispatching and police communications were supposed to be consolidated in the building, but that has not occurred because Amtrak has not yet been able to determine if the building can accommodate a large generator necessary to provide emergency power. In addition, Amtrak has been unable to move forward with a plan to move more than 400 information-technology workers to Wilmington. The report found that so many workers would refuse the transfer that operations would be unacceptably disrupted. Amtrak now estimates it won’t need as much space in the building as originally thought.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A moment of happiness and celebration at the Lincoln Memorial turned into a headache for workers with the National Park Service, WUSA-TV reports. The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed to the public Saturday morning after celebrating university graduates reportedly left a mess on the steps of the monument, a National Park Service official said. NPS tweeted a photo of the closure Saturday, claiming the graduation celebration left broken bottles, spilled wine and champagne covering the steps of the national monument. “We will reopen as soon as the area has been cleaned and made safe,” NPS said on Twitter. Facilities staff members worked through the morning and were able to clean the mess within a few hours. The Lincoln Memorial reopened about 11:30 a.m. NPS did not say from which school the celebrating graduates hailed, but many online theorize the students could be from Georgetown University. A spokesperson for the school called the incident “concerning and disappointing.” The spokesperson noted that Georgetown was one of many universities having ceremonies over the weekend and said it no university-sponsored events at or around the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: A billionaire developer from Dubai is set to purchase the site of a South Florida condominium that collapsed last June, killing 98 people, for $120 million after no other bids were submitted by the Friday evening deadline for this week’s auction. Michael Fay, of Avison Young, said hundreds of potential buyers had shown interest in the property, but none were ultimately prepared to match the strong initial bid of Hussain Sajwani, of DAMAC Properties. Avison Young is the commercial real estate firm that was appointed to market the land as part of a class-action lawsuit. The auction for the 1.8-acre parcel in Surfside was scheduled for Tuesday. Earlier this month, families of the victims reached a $997 million settlement with local officials, the developers of an adjacent building and others whom they hold responsible for the collapse of the 40-year-old, 12-story beachside building during the early hours of June 24. Most of the Champlain Towers South collapsed suddenly about 1:20 a.m. last June 24 as most of its residents slept. Only three people survived the initial collapse. No other survivors were found despite the around-the-clock efforts of rescuers who dug through a 40-foot pile of rubble for two weeks. Another three dozen people were in the portion of the building that remained standing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWatkinsville: Two Republican front-runners hoping to clinch primary majorities made their final pitches to voters Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s election. Gov. Brian Kemp and former football star Herschel Walker hope to win GOP nominations for governor and U.S. senator Tuesday without runoffs, with polls showing both men backed by more than 50% of voters. Kemp met voters at a rally in Watkinsville, near his home in Athens, with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts showing up to support him. Walker spoke to Republicans in Columbus, having moved into a more public campaign phase in recent days despite continued questions about his past. Walker has been accused of threatening his ex-wife’s life, exaggerating his business record and lying about graduating from the University of Georgia. An Associated Press story Saturday found that Walker was actually a paid spokesman for a for-profit veterans program that Walker has described as a way he helps veterans. Walker’s speech focused on his life story and general attacks on Democratic policies. “It is time that we get back to where we started,” Walker said, arguing that Democrats have strayed from American values. Other candidates making final pitches include former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, Kemp’s top rival for the Republican nomination, and state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and Navy veteran and former banker Latham Saddler, Walker’s rivals for the Senate seat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Board of Education has selected the former principal of Waipahu High School to be the next superintendent of the state’s public schools. The board voted 8-1 Thursday to select Keith Hayashi, who has been interim superintendent since August. At Waipahu High School, Hayashi pioneered the Early College program, which allows high school students to take college classes through a partnership with the University of Hawaii. College professors teach the classes on high school campuses for which students receive both high school and college credit. The program is now available at 36 high schools across the state. The board’s chairperson, Catherine Payne, said the board was looking for a candidate who could heal the school system, bring the community and stakeholders together, and transition schools out of the pandemic. “His work at Waipahu High School has really touched a lot of students who were struggling and helped them to move forward into successful lives,” Payne said. “So looking at how that might be able to be applied throughout our system is really important.” Hayashi’s appointment will take effect July 1. Payne said his salary and other contract details will be negotiated. The state Legislature has set a maximum salary of $250,000 a year for the job.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate in April dropped a tenth of a percent to 2.6% to mark a third consecutive month of historic lows since record-keeping started in 1976, state officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said 913,000 workers have jobs, while about 24,000 are looking for work, as Idaho’s red-hot economy continues. The state’s labor force of 937,000 in April represents a labor force participation rate of 62.1%, an increase of a tenth of a percent over the previous month. Idaho’s peak participation rate was 71.4% in September 1998. The labor force participation rate is calculated from those 16 years and older working or looking for work. The Labor Department said there are more than two jobs available for every unemployed Idaho resident looking for work. Idaho’s nonfarm jobs exceeded expectations with an increase of 3,000 jobs to 815,500 in April. Industry sectors showing the most gains include natural resources, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and private educational services. Those showing greatest job declines include arts, entertainment and recreation, and information. Idaho’s unemployment rate continues to run below the national unemployment rate, which was 3.6% in April.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An officer who shot and seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy who ran away after being pulled over while driving a stolen vehicle was relieved of his police powers Friday, officials said. “He’s still an active member of the Chicago Police Department,” police spokesman Don Terry told the Chicago Tribune about the officer, whose name hasn’t been released. “He’s not going to be patrolling the streets, and he won’t be able to arrest people.” The action means the officer will still get paid but will be assigned to “desk duty,” Terry said. The officer had already been placed on administrative duties while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates the shooting. Police Superintendent David Brown said Thursday that the fleeing teenager turned toward the officer during Wednesday’s encounter before the officer fired on him. No shots were fired at the officer, Brown said. The boy jumped from the car as officers approached the vehicle, which police said was stolen Monday and used in a carjacking Tuesday. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital, Brown said Thursday. He did not elaborate, and no charges have been announced. No weapon was found at the scene, COPA said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democrats and activists are holding out little hope of getting the votes needed to uphold the governor’s veto of a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in school sports. The Republican-dominated Legislature is slated to override the veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who said in March that the legislation doesn’t provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports.” But the bill passed by wide margins, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate pledged to override Holcomb’s veto with simple majorities. Although two Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted against the measure, Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis said the override will likely be successful when the Legislature reconvenes for one day Tuesday. “This bill was filed, I believe, with the intention to specifically go after transgender Hoosiers because it was a politically savvy thing to do for the Republican base,” Ford said Friday. Still, Ford said Democrats continue to have conversations with lawmakers across the aisle, noting that some Republicans might be inclined to change their votes following the primary and the governor’s veto.\n\nIowa\n\nBettendorf: Students are once again attending class in the 1873 Forest Grove School. After raising about $200,000 over seven years to restore the falling-down, one-room school, supporters have opened the building for free “reenactments” of a typical student day. A schoolmarm teaches subjects and skills as they might have been taught during the 1920s, the time period to which the school was restored. Iowa once had 12,000 to 14,000 one-room school houses, depending on the report consulted, but with either number, Iowa had more than any other state in the nation. Supporters of Forest Grove preservation efforts want Forest Grove to be used to interpret and teach the role these schools played in the state’s history, Sharon Andresen, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, told the Quad-City Times. Because of legislation requiring consolidation of schools, Iowa’s last one-room school closed in 1967; Forest Grove closed 10 years earlier in 1957. Half- or full-day reenactments are open to any public, private or homeschool classes in the Quad City area. Fourth grade is a good target level, but Diane Borcherding, a retired Bettendorf High School biology teacher who is volunteering her time as the schoolmarm, is open to other grades, depending on the circumstances.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Supreme Court on Friday disbarred former prosecutor Jacqie Spradling for her conduct during a double-murder trial in Topeka in 2012. The court said while Spradling was a prosecutor in Shawnee County, she engaged in “repeated patterns of misconduct” during the trial of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of killing her husband and his fiance. Chandler’s convictions were later overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. She is scheduled for a new trial later this year. The Supreme Court said Spradling ignored a court order, made arguments not supported by evidence, lied in her briefs and oral arguments, and made false statements during a disciplinary investigation. The Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys recommended in June 2021 that Spradling be disbarred for her “win at all costs” attitude in the Chandler case and in the 2017 conviction of Jacob Ewing, of Holton, on rape and sodomy charges. The state Supreme Court found Spradling did not violate ethical standards in Ewing’s case. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed Ewing’s conviction in 2018, but he later accepted a plea deal. Last year, Spradling resigned from her position as assistant county attorney in Allen County and as county attorney in Bourbon County.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Katy Perry earned her zookeeper stripes at the Louisville Zoo on Saturday. Zoo staff welcomed the pop music icon with an up-close encounter featuring the zoo’s own superstars, Simon, a black-footed penguin, and Sebastian the sloth. The “Roar” singer has been staying in Kentucky recently with her daughter, Daisy Dove, while fiancé Orlando Bloom shoots his new movie, “Red Right Hand.” Production on that film is expected to wrap up in June. At the zoo, Perry was “Walking on Air” through Wild Lights, a lantern festival featuring 50,000 LED lights. She also posed like a penguin next to Simon and admired the hang-ten skills of Sebastian the sloth, who “truly connected” with Perry, according to a post on the zoo sloths’ Twitter page. The Louisville Zoo features over 1,200 animals in exhibits with themes from all over the world, including Africa, home to Simon and other African penguins, as well as Australia and South America, where the sloths hang out. Earlier this month, Chelsea Handler hosted Perry on her podcast, “Dear Chelsea,” to chat about Perry’s stay in the Bluegrass State. “I’m like, living in Kentucky, and I have for almost a month now. And that’s quite an amazing experience because it reminds you that Hollywood is not America,” Perry said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has agreed to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of shots students are required to get to enroll in school, officials said. The state health department said in a news release Wednesday that it will continue to strongly recommend the vaccine, in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, but acknowledged that the vaccine had not yet received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for those under age 16. “While we strongly recommend all eligible children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now, if they have not already been so, we are making this decision to give families and schools the time they need to prepare accordingly,” the news release said. Because the vaccine is not fully approved for those age 15 and under, requiring it would have made little difference to most students in kindergarten through high school, Edwards noted during his monthly call-in radio show. State Sen. Fred Mills, R-New Iberia, announced on the Senate floor that the administration agreed to remove the requirement after meeting with legislators. Legislation that would have removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the requirement list had stalled earlier in the session.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A teacher whose LGBTQ lesson plan for kindergartners was removed from a state website said Friday that the governor and education department succumbed to outside pressure. The governor and department “caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people, families, and students in Maine,” Kailina Mills wrote in a social media post. The lesson plan was at the heart of a Republican attack ad that accused Democratic Gov. Janet Mills of spending $2.8 million to create “radical school lessons” aimed at kindergartners. On the video, the teacher discusses “Freedom Holidays” like the Fourth of July, Juneteenth and Women’s Equality Day before discussing freedoms won by the LGBTQ community, including same-sex marriage. She talks about sexual identities under the umbrella of “LGBT+” in the discussion. The governor previously said she agreed with the Department of Education’s review that concluded the lesson wasn’t age-appropriate. Kailina Mills disagreed with that assessment, citing a study that showed gender identities are solidified between ages 5 and 7. She wrote Friday that she’s taught preschoolers who are transgender and nonbinary and said that “those children and those families deserve to be represented in their school curriculum.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A western Maryland race track has evicted the remnants of a trucker protest that had used the site as a staging ground. The People’s Convoy had conducted a series of rolling protests around the Capital Beltway in March to protest pandemic restrictions and other grievances. After a hiatus, a smaller group of truckers returned Wednesday to the Hagerstown Speedway. But Speedway General Manager Lisa Plessinger asked the group to leave amid infighting over its next steps. The last of the truckers left Friday night, she said. She compared the convoy to “like when your mother-in-law comes to visit and decides to stay.” A press release issued Friday on a Facebook page for The People’s Convoy “declares victory and announces its conclusion of the national convoy portion of this great movement.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: More than 40 people – including marine mammal experts, interns and volunteers – spent several hours battling an incoming tide to help rescue seven dolphins that got stranded in the shallow waters of a Cape Cod river last week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare first got word that the Atlantic white-sided dolphins got stranded in a shallow gut of the Herring River in Wellfleet on Wednesday morning, and rescuers were on the scene in about an hour, the organization said in a statement. It’s not unusual for dolphins to get stranded in the area because of its shape as a hook within the larger hook of Cape Cod’s shoreline and because of large tidal fluctuations in Cape Cod Bay. “The dolphins appeared alert and in good health, but the day was sure to be sunny and warm, and we needed to move quickly,” said Misty Niemeyer, of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team. The tide was also coming in, and dolphins often risk getting stranded again when it rolls out, she said. The dolphins – all likely young males, 6 to 8 feet in length and weighing up to 250 pounds – were then taken in a vehicle custom-designed to transport dolphins and released in deeper waters off Provincetown in the early afternoon.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Nearly all of the power lost following a deadly tornado that killed two people and flattened parts of a northern Michigan community has been restored, state police said Sunday. Police also said everyone had been accounted for in Gaylord, where Friday afternoon’s EF3 twister also left more than 40 people injured. Authorities had said Saturday that they were not able to account for one person. Cleanup continued Sunday in the town of 4,200 people about 230 miles northwest of Detroit. About 6,100 utility customers in Otsego County, where Gaylord is the county seat, lost power due to Friday’s storms, according to Jackson-based Consumers Energy. State police said Sunday that electricity had been restored to 99% of utility customers in Gaylord. The tornado packed winds of 140 mph that tore roofs and walls from businesses and largely destroyed a mobile home park. Such storms are uncommon in northern Michigan. State police Lt. Derrick Carroll has said the city doesn’t have tornado sirens, though anyone with a mobile phone got a “code red” warning from the weather service about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The Nottingham Forest mobile home park was one of the first places hit by the tornado. Two residents, described by police as being in their 70s, were killed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: A partial skull that was discovered last summer by two kayakers will be returned to Native American officials after investigations determined it was about 8,000 years old. The kayakers found the skull in the drought-depleted Minnesota River about 110 miles west of Minneapolis, Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said. Thinking it might be related to a missing person case or murder, Hable turned the skull over to a medical examiner and eventually to the FBI, where a forensic anthropologist used carbon dating to determine it was likely the skull of a young man who lived between 5500 and 6000 B.C., Hable said. “It was a complete shock to us that that bone was that old,” Hable told Minnesota Public Radio. The anthropologist determined the man had a depression in his skull that was “perhaps suggestive of the cause of death.” After the sheriff posted about the discovery Wednesday, his office was criticized by several Native Americans, who said publishing photos of ancestral remains was offensive to their culture. Hable said his office removed the post. “We didn’t mean for it to be offensive whatsoever,” he said. Hable said the remains will be turned over to Upper Sioux Community tribal officials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Gilbert Mason Jr., who grew up in the civil rights movement and became a physician and a Black and civil rights historian, has died at age 68. Mason died Wednesday and funeral arrangements were not yet complete, according to Infinity Funeral Home in Biloxi. Mason was 5 years old in 1959 when he watched his father, Gilbert Mason Sr., lead Biloxi’s first wade-in to desegregate beaches, the Sun Herald reports. And his name was on the 1971 lawsuit that made Biloxi schools the state’s first to integrate. Like his father, Mason became a physician who served poor people. His practice was in the New Orleans area, but he returned to Biloxi when his father became ill. The elder Mason died in 2006. The son spent his last years documenting civil rights and Black history and his father’s accomplishments, the newspaper reports. Father and son both had photographic memories, said Clemon Jimerson Sr. He said the younger Mason’s memories helped to document the history of scouting on the Mississippi Coast, the music history of Biloxi and other areas for the Mississippi Blues Trail, the integration of Coast schools, and the preservation of Nichols Elementary, the historically Black school in East Biloxi.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: City officials have approved a new ordinance that clarifies when people may witness or record police officers’ actions without being arrested. The Kansas City Council on Thursday approved the ordinance to settle a federal lawsuit filed by three women who were arrested during racial injustice protests in 2020. The women were charged with violating city laws involving resisting or interfering with an officer. The lawsuit said those laws were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, KCUR reports. The ordinance approved Thursday says witnessing or recording police officers does not violate city law unless the offender is substantially impeding the officer’s duties. The women were among more than 200 nonviolent protesters arrested at or near the Country Club Plaza during protests after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The settlement did not require the city to pay any monetary damages.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A full month after a judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to undergo surgery before they could change their gender on their birth certificate, the state still isn’t in compliance with the court order, the ACLU of Montana said. Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the state health department, said the agency is still working with the Department of Justice to review the April 21 ruling and its implications. He did not respond to an email asking if that meant the state was evaluating whether to appeal the order. “We have continued to be patient in allowing the state time to comply with the court ordered preliminary injunction,” the ACLU of Montana said in a recent statement. “However, close to one month has passed and the State’s willful indifference to the court order is inexcusable.” Montana is among a growing list of Republican-controlled states that have moved to restrict transgender rights, including requiring student-athletes to participate in sports based on their gender assigned at birth or making it illegal for transgender minors to be treated with hormones or puberty blockers.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: A pilot died after a single-engine plane crashed at the Wayne Municipal Airport, officials said. The Cessna 140 crashed Friday evening during the MayDay STOL Drag Races. The organization that planned the events said in a Facebook post that the pilot crashed on final approach at the airport after apparently stalling and spinning. No one else was aboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The pilot’s name was not released. STOL, or short take-off and landing, drag racing involves pilots flying side-by-side 2,000 feet down and back up. The rest of the weekend’s planned events were canceled.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 emergency declarations for Nevada ended Friday as the public health agency for metro Las Vegas noted that the pandemic isn’t over and said it will continue to monitor spread of the coronavirus and provide assistance with vaccinating and testing. While most of the state’s pandemic measures, including business restrictions and mask mandates, have already been lifted, the Southern Nevada Health District said it was important to remind the public that the virus that causes COVID-19 continued to circulate. “Cases are currently increasing, and new variants are emerging,” said Dr. Fermin Leguen, chief medical officer for the district. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the state’s emergency Friday – a planned action he announced two weeks ago, saying he wanted to ensure that there would be no gap in services. “Today, we are turning the page on the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19 and are laser focused on ensuring our recovery from the public health, fiscal and economy crisis serves the needs of Nevada’s families,” Sisolak, a Democrat running for reelection, said Thursday in a statement. Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas area, on Thursday announced the end of of its emergency declaration, which was declared March 15, 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConway: A forest fire in northern New Hampshire that’s burned 106 acres is nearly contained, officials said Friday. The Bemis Fire in Crawford Notch State Park, the White Mountain National Forest, and on private land began May 13 in steep, rugged terrain. The cause is under investigation. “It’s important for the public to know that the Bemis Fire remains an active fire scene, and there are still firefighters and equipment on site,” said Capt. Adrian Reyes of the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau. “This weekend is expected to bring record temperatures to the region, and we ask that anyone wishing to spend time outdoors avoids the area of the fire, for their own safety as well as for the safety of the wildland crew,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear population appears to be increasing, based on the number of reported serious encounters with humans, but as New Jersey has had no official bear management plan for the past two years, the Division of Fish and Wildlife doesn’t know for sure. Without the plan, the division did not make an estimate of the bear population in the state’s northwest area last year and won’t do so this year. The last count was done in 2020 and coincided with the last statewide bear hunt. At that time there were about 3,158 bears in northwestern New Jersey, specifically in the areas previously designated as bear hunting zones north of Route 80 and west of Route 287. Records show that reported serious encounters with bears since the count have gone up nearly ninefold. “The DEP does not have a statewide population estimate, though sightings of black bears have been reported in all 21 counties,” said the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Division of Fish and Wildlife. At least two people in Sussex County were injured in separate black bear encounters just outside their homes, and at least three dogs were killed or injured. The 2020 count shows the bear population doubled from the 1,522 counted in 2018, the last year a bear hunt was allowed on state-owned lands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMora: As more than 2,700 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Sunday, many evacuees were growing concerned about their future after weeks away from home. The biggest fire in the state’s recorded history has been burning for six weeks now, and some of the hundreds forced to evacuate say their financial resources are dwindling. Amity Maes, a 30-year-old Mora resident who said she is 81/ 2 months pregnant and penniless, told the Santa Fe New Mexican she bounced around for weeks before finding shelter at an evacuation center in Glorieta, where she believes she contracted COVID-19. Officials at Glorieta Adventure Camps said there have been 67 coronavirus cases among evacuees, including some that required hospitalization. After her isolation period, Maes said she was urged to leave and go to a hotel in Santa Fe where she could be closer to a hospital if she went into labor. But the hotel didn’t have her reservation when she arrived, and when she finally got a room, it was only for one night. “They keep encouraging us to go to Albuquerque” where evacuees are being housed in hotels, Maes told the newspaper. “We don’t have gas. We don’t have no income. There’s no gas vouchers. There’s no anything. I’m on a quarter-tank of gas, and I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street inside the city’s sole Army base now bears the name of a Black Congressional Medal of Honor recipient rather than a Confederate general. Fort Hamilton changed the road’s name to John Warren Avenue on Friday morning, following a years-old push by local officials to remove Confederate symbols nationwide. The base had previously called the street General Lee Avenue, after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lt. John Warren, of Brooklyn, was killed at the age of 22 in 1969 in the Vietnam War when he fell in the direction of a grenade and shielded at least three men from the blast. His Congressional Medal of Honor citation says Williams’ “ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.” Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, and his Congressional Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to him in 1970. The base will also rename its Stonewall Jackson Drive, which is named after another Confederate general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Advocacy groups and voters who this year persuaded state courts to overturn the Legislature’s congressional redistricting plan asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to avoid hearing arguments on whether such courts must be curtailed in reviewing U.S. House maps. Attorneys representing the state also joined with outside lawyers to file four legal briefs with the justices urging them to reject a petition from Republican legislative leaders to take up the issue. Through their own private lawyers, the GOP lawmakers already asked the court to formally rule on whether a provision in the U.S. Constitution delegating to state legislatures the manner of holding U.S. House elections means that state judges can’t void congressional district lines created by the General Assembly. The authors of Friday’s filings say the Supreme Court already has ruled before that some decision-making on congressional redistricting can be delegated by a state’s citizens. The same holds true when the North Carolina Legislature passed laws two decades ago setting in place the authority of courts to review redistricting plans that they approved, the lawyers wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nPembina: One of the largest employers in northeastern North Dakota is closing later this year. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based New Flyer Industries is shutting down its charter and transit bus manufacturing plant in Pembina, located close to the Canadian border. Pembina Mayor Mike Fitzgerald said company was notified of the decision in a letter. The company told Fitzgerald that it was having difficulty finding qualified employees, a factor in its conversion to electric vehicles, and the plant’s location has become an issue. New Flyer has a plant in Crookston, Minnesota, which is about 100 miles from Pembina. Fitzgerald called the move “devastating” and said it will put more than 200 employees out of work, KFGO radio reports. The Pembina plant opened in 1963.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit pairing photographs from two moments of societal crisis – the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic – aims to help visitors see parallels between the human tolls felt across generations. The show, “Chronicles: The Great Depression and the Pandemic,” opened Saturday at the and runs through Aug. 28. It couples images of day-to-day life gathered by 10 Depression-era photographers and five contemporary Ohio photographers. The 1930s photographers – including Dorothea Lange, Esther Bubley, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Carl Mydans, Gordon Parks, John Vachon and Ben Shahn – were hired by the U.S. government Works Progress Administration’s Farm Security Administration. The Ohio photographers are Autumn Bland, Donald Black, Jr., Angelo Merendino, Jane Alden Stevens and Shane Wynn. Their pictures document the ravages of the coronavirus across different social and economic groups. Special events tied to the exhibit include a talk with co-curators Christine Fowler Shearer and Arnold Tunstall on Sunday, a history lecture on the WPA, an artist talk with Wynn, and classes on smartphone photography and enhancing Instagram accounts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With the state only days away from enacting the toughest ban on abortion in the U.S., questions remained Friday about enforcing the law’s limited exceptions. The law allows abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life “in a medical emergency,” and supporters said doctors still would decide what an emergency is, though that could change later if it becomes perceived as a loophole. There’s also an exception for cases of rape, sexual assault or incest that have been reported to law enforcement, but that doesn’t help victims who don’t report the crimes to police. Abortion providers said they are likely to be cautious because the new law, like a ban at about six weeks enacted earlier and a similar 2021 law in Texas, will expose them to potentially expensive lawsuits over alleged violations. They’re planning to refer some patients to states like Colorado or Kansas, but some won’t be able to manage the extra time or travel involved. Oklahoma will provide a preview of what is in store for other states if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through on a draft opinion leaked earlier this month overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The law also is likely to prompt Oklahoma residents – and Texans who’d traveled to the neighboring state – to go elsewhere to end their pregnancies.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A Democratic state lawmaker is calling for an investigation into a ballot-printing fiasco that will delay results from Tuesday’s primary by weeks, with a key U.S. House race hanging in the balance in a state that prides itself on voter access and election transparency. Tens of thousands of ballots in the state’s third-largest county were printed with blurred barcodes, making them unreadable by vote-counting machines – a mistake that wasn’t caught until ballots were already being returned in the vote-by-mail state. Elections workers must now hand-transfer the votes from those ballots to new ones that can be read in a painstaking process that also raises the possibility of duplication errors. As the scope of the crisis became apparent, local, state and federal lawmakers Friday all escalated their criticism of Clackamas County Elections Clerk Sherry Hall, who defended her actions at a news conference Friday and said she had learned from the mistakes. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who represents voters in the county, called the situation “unreasonable, and untenable,” and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents some Clackamas voters in Congress, called Hall’s slow reaction “unconscionable.” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan demanded a written plan from Hall detailing how she would get results tabulated by June 13, the state deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Summer Lee has won a five-way Democratic primary for a Pittsburgh-based U.S. House seat, making her the favorite in the heavily Democratic district to win the fall general election and become the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Friday was the fourth day of counting ballots after Tuesday’s primary in the closely contested race for the open 12th District seat. Lee, a second-term state House member, lawyer and former labor organizer, comes from the party’s progressive wing. She was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two-time presidential candidate and a leading voice in the Democratic Party’s left wing who came to campaign for Lee. Lee beat out second-place Steve Irwin, who was endorsed by the Allegheny County Democratic Party and backed by prominent Democrats from the county. The seat is open because longtime Rep. Mike Doyle – first elected in 1994 – is not running again. It also has new boundaries since Pennsylvania’s congressional districts were redrawn to account for a decade of demographic changes identified by the 2020 census. Lee will face the Republican nominee of the same name as the outgoing Democratic incumbent – Mike Doyle – in the fall general election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Dr. Anthony Fauci urged graduates of Roger Williams University on Friday to fight what he called the “normalization of untruths,” which has become a growing and more troubling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the face of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus, was the commencement ceremony’s keynote speaker but addressed students at the private Rhode Island college remotely because he had to attend a memorial service for a family member. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have experienced firsthand something that has troubled and saddened me – a deepened divisiveness in our nation,” he said. “Unfortunately, differences of opinion or ideology are propped up by deliberate distortions of reality to the point of fabrications, conspiracy theories, and outright lies.” He told the students to apply the analytic skills they have learned during their time at the university to challenge and renounce untruths, which he called a threat to the nation. “Reject the politicization of science that denigrates evidence and facts,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two new state laws require elementary school teachers to get a 30-minute break each day without students and ban districts from turning over school lunch debt to collection agencies. The bills were passed in the final days of the 2022 General Assembly session and signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster. Both passed the House and Senate unanimously. The break bill requires teachers in elementary school and special education teachers who have students in their classes for most of the day to get 30 minutes without any assigned duties or responsibilities. Teacher groups requested the law, saying some teachers never had time to eat a lunch or even use the bathroom because they were watching students. A second bill prohibits school districts from turning over debt a student owes for school lunches to a collection agency. Supporters said students need to eat regardless of their ability to pay, and turning debt over to a collection agency was too drastic of a step.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled a sex crime conviction doesn’t require an actual victim. The court last week upheld the conviction of a man stemming from a sting operation during the 2017 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Carlocito Slim argued he was just looking for a massage when he responded to an ad on the Backpage website under the headline “Women Seeking Men.” Slim was actually responding to an ad that was a sting setup and unknowingly texted a special agent with South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation. The agent, posing as a pimp, told Slim he could meet a 15-year-old girl. And when Slim showed up at the assigned meeting place with condoms and $200, he was arrested and later convicted of two federal felonies. Slim argued there couldn’t be a conviction because there was no pimp and no crime victim. Defense attorney Terry Pechota told the judges his client simply didn’t understand the text communications and was only looking for a massage, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “He doesn’t ask about whether or not the girl is 16, or whether they’re going to engage in any funny stuff or illegal stuff,” Pechota said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman said Slim knew what was going on and later told investigators he thought he was meeting a girl for sex.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Friday that he doesn’t have a timeline yet on when his administration might roll out a long-blocked school voucher program that saw its biggest legal roadblock removed by the state’s high court last week. The Republican told reporters it was a “good first step” for the Supreme Court to rule Wednesday that the voucher initiative doesn’t violate the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. The decision upends earlier court rulings that have kept the program that passed in 2019 from ever being implemented. The program applies only to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The two counties were among the entities that sued over the program. But the governor also said there are “legal decisions yet to be made” and “a lot of steps that have to come to fruition” before the program can get up and running. “Once we determine the speed with which the court will make its final decisions, then we can move forward with the particulars to make sure this works and fits, and how it is that we roll it out,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMentone: The top elected official in a rural, sparsely populated West Texas county has been arrested after being accused of stealing cattle. Loving County Judge Skeet Jones, 71, and three other men were arrested Friday on charges of livestock theft and engaging in organized criminal activity. All four men were taken to the jail in neighboring Winkler County, where they have since been released on bond. Jones hadn’t returned a call seeking comment Sunday. The arrests came after a yearlong investigation, according to a statement from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. The association has commissioned peace officers known as special rangers who investigate agricultural crimes, including the theft of cattle and horses. The rangers also determine the ownership of stray livestock. The association’s special rangers allege Jones and the others gathered stray cattle and sold them without following procedures set forth in the Texas Agriculture Code. Those procedures include calling the sheriff to report stray livestock and allowing the sheriff to search for the animal’s owner. The association declined to provide additional details about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. The theft of livestock charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the organized criminal activity charge up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southern Utah’s first 24-hour child care center is opening soon, aiming to help families break away from poverty. The new Stepping Stones day care center is slated to open June 1 and will be housed under SwitchPoint, the St. George-based nonprofit that runs and operates the area’s largest homeless shelter, food bank and other programs aimed at helping people living in poverty. The center will stay open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and will aim to help parents and guardians who struggle who pay the costs of child care elsewhere. “We’ve got to create something that can help alleviate keeping families trapped in poverty,” said Carol Holloway, the executive director of Switchpoint, to a packed room of people at a ribbon-cutting event at the center Tuesday. Kamie Blake, the program director for the care center, said it will be the only 24/7 child care center in southern Utah and one of the few in operation in the state. Children as young as 6 weeks old and up to 12 years old will be eligible to attend. At full capacity, Stepping Stones can take up to 270 kids each day and has a kitchen, laundry and sleeping areas to accommodate the round-the-clock operations. There are five classrooms on site, with lessons scheduled based on age.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have created a drug use standards advisory board within the state sentencing commission, saying it “places no limits on which drugs can be contemplated for legalization or the amounts.” The board would determine “the benchmark personal use dosage and the benchmark personal use supply” for regulated and unregulated drugs, with a goal of preventing and reducing the criminalization of personal drug use, according to the bill. Scott, a Republican, said in his letter Thursday to the General Assembly the bill includes “absolutely no recognition” of health and safety impacts of using fentanyl, heroin and other drugs, and it doesn’t acknowledge law enforcement’s role in stopping dealers. Scott also vetoed a bill that would have expanded eligibility for the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent crimes. “Ultimately, I find this bill inconsistent with the State’s responsibilities to keep the public safe,” he wrote. Rep. Selene Colburn, P-Burlington, who supported both bills, said she was upset about the outcome, WCAX-TV reports. “We are not talking about reducing penalties for violent crimes or changing expungement eligibility. We are simply talking about treating people who have used drugs and who have struggled with substance use disorder with dignity and respect and the basic belief that their lives are valuable,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Attorneys for the U.S. government have indicated they will not oppose a plan to lift all remaining restrictions next month on John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington ruled last year that Hinckley can be freed unconditionally in June if he continues to follow the rules placed on him and remains mentally stable as he continues to live in Williamsburg. Hinckley, 66, has indeed remained mentally stable and violated no conditions, according to a letter filed by U.S. attorneys with the court Thursday. That determination was based on letters from the Washington’s Department of Health, which has overseen Hinckley’s care. A court hearing is scheduled for June 1. Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis, when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president and injured three others. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time, after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. She died in July. He signed a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the area last year and began living there with his cat, Theo, according to court filings. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that he’s found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. He’s also shared his music on YouTube.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An invasive European green crab was captured last week in Hood Canal, the farthest south the species has been found in the Salish Sea. Volunteers with Washington Sea Grant trapped the male European green crab in Nick’s Lagoon near Seabeck in Kitsap County, The Seattle Times reports. The organization has been tasked by the state with early detection of the crab’s spread. Washington Sea Grant marine ecologist Emily Grason said in a news release the crab arrived at the lagoon last year, based on its size. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in response will increase trapping there to assess the scope of the green crab presence and try to locally eradicate the species. Gov. Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation in January to address a significant increase in European green crab populations within the Lummi Nation’s sea pond near Bellingham. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age. It also out-competes native crab species and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems. It was first found in Washington’s inland waters in 2016.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that social services workers will receive a 15% pay increase by tapping funds from existing vacant positions after such efforts failed in the Legislature. About 970 employees of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Social Services will receive the raises starting June 18. There are more than 6,500 children in the care of the state. According to the DHHR, there is a 30% vacancy rate statewide for foster care employees. “I told you we’d get this done, and we got it done without spending any excess money,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “I always say we need to mind the store, and we’ve done it the right way. As a result, we’re now able to compensate these people that are doing incredible work.” Employee pay raises and other key provisions were stripped from a social services bill before it died on the final day of the regular legislative session in March. After the pay raises were gutted, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch told a Senate committee that the department would reduce the number of open positions to provide the much-needed raises to child protective services employees. Crouch said Thursday those vacant positions indeed funded the raises.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A disorderly conduct conviction can’t disqualify someone from obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a unanimous decision that could dramatically broaden who can carry hidden firearms, knives and stun guns. The court found that disorderly conduct isn’t a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law and therefore doesn’t disqualify a person from holding a concealed carry license. Justice Jill Karofsky, a member of the court’s liberal minority, concurred but in a separate opinion called on legislators to close a “dangerous loophole” that will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons. Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill a year ago that would have reconciled the language, but it never got got a hearing. “Though legally correct, this result is as nonsensical as it is dangerous,” Karofsky wrote. “When a domestic abuse perpetrator, who has engaged in threats to kill or any other type of domestic violence, has access to a gun, the lethality risk for his victim increases significantly.” The case revolves around Daniel Doubek, of Green Bay. According to court documents, Doubek broke into his estranged wife’s trailer in Door County in 1993 waving a board and shouting threats. He was ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local reservoirs are likely to be nearly drained this summer amid lingering drought in the Snake River basin, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Federal officials predicted Thursday during an annual water meeting at the Teton County Library that reservoirs like Jackson Lake and Palisades could fall to 2%-10% if summer proves particularly hot and dry, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/01/women-baseball-lynyrd-skynyrd-circus-fire-news-around-states/39646053/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nChatom: The local Ford dealership has ended a Fourth of July promotion that gave a Bible, American flag and gift certificate for a 12-gauge shotgun to anyone who bought a new or used vehicle. News outlets report Ford Motor Co. told Ford Chatom that the promotion was inappropriate after a worker fired from a California dealership killed two employees last week before killing himself. Dealership general manager Colin Ward says he’s disappointed the automaker requested the promotion be ended. He says the dealership is fulfilling any commitments it already made. Ward says customers could have received a Torah or Quran instead of a Bible if they wanted during the “God, guns and freedom” promotion. Ford Motor Co. spokesman T.R. Reid says the company wasn’t involved in developing the local promotion.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Northern Alaska coastal communities and climate scientists say sea ice disappeared far earlier than normal this spring, and it’s affecting wildlife. The Anchorage Daily News reports ice melted because of exceptionally warm ocean temperatures. Janet Mitchell of Kivalina says hunters used to be able to find bearded seals on sea ice just outside the village. This year, family hunters traveled more than 50 miles by boat to find bearded seals in early June. The hunters ran out of gas on their way back and had to call other residents to bring them more fuel. University of Alaska Fairbanks climatologist Rick Thoman says sea surface temperatures last week in the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas were as high as 9 degrees above the 1981-2010 average.\n\nArizona\n\nYarnell: Nineteen bells rang and 19 names were spoken aloud amid somber silence Sunday afternoon in this town at the edge of a wildfire that killed 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters six years ago. Every year since, on June 30, Prescott and Yarnell have remembered the 19 men, casualties of the deadliest U.S. wildland fire in 80 years. The Yarnell Hill Fire, which began June 28, 2013, burned across 8,400 acres and ruined more than 100 structures. At the Yarnell Hill Fire Memorial Park on Sunday, nearly 200 people assembled in a dirt enclosure that is hoped to become a park dedicated to the Hotshots and the fire they battled. Simultaneously in Prescott, the home base for the firefighters, community members gathered in the town square as the Yavapai County Courthouse rang its bell 19 times.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: Sports wagering has begun in the state, with the first bets being placed at a Hot Springs casino. Spokeswoman Jennifer Hoyt said in a statement that Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort began offering sports wagering Monday morning and will allow gamblers to bet on games ranging from professional football and college basketball to cricket and rugby. Hoyt said bets can be placed with tellers seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or at kiosks at the casino. The Arkansas Racing Commission approved sportsbook wagering at Oaklawn last month. In March, the commission approved full casino licenses for Oaklawn and Southland Gaming and Racing in West Memphis.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A $2 billion transit terminal that shut down shortly after its inauguration last year has partially reopened. The terminal’s lobby and its 5.4-acre rooftop park reopened Monday to the public, but bus service won’t resume until later this summer. KPIX-TV reports officials say programs and activities, including live music, yoga and activities for kids, will restart this week. The terminal called the Salesforce Transit Center opened Aug. 12, 2018, to great fanfare. Officials closed the terminal in September after finding two cracked beams. The new center replaced the grim and seismically deficient Transbay Terminal nearby. It is meant to be a modern transportation hub with food trucks, pop-up retail shops and a rooftop park.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Five years after the recreational use of marijuana was legalized, the state has surpassed $1 billion in tax revenue from pot sales. The Colorado Department of Revenue announced last month that sales since legalization had topped $6.5 billion. The state has more than 2,900 licensed marijuana businesses and more than 41,000 licensed workers in the industry. “This industry is helping grow our economy by creating jobs and generating valuable revenue,” Gov. Jared Polis said. The Denver Post reports marijuana revenue funds a variety of public health programs, including mental health services, youth literacy initiatives and anti-bullying programs in schools. The tax revenue goes to state and local governments. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is planning a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of what has become known as the Day the Clowns Cried, when more than 150 people died in a big-top fire. The remembrance ceremony for the Hartford Circus Fire will take place July 6 at the memorial site on Barbour Street. An estimated 7,000 people were attending the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1944 when the big top caught fire. The blaze spread quickly, fueled by a mixture of gasoline and paraffin wax that was used to waterproof the tent. The death toll has been put at various times between 167 and 169 people. More than 700 were injured, many of them children. The cause of the fire has never been determined.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers have given final approval to a bill expanding the state’s decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana to juveniles. Lawmakers voted 34 to 7 for the bill Sunday, the last day of this year’s legislative session. The measure now goes to Democratic Gov. John Carney for his signature. Possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is currently a civil violation for anyone over 21 but a criminal misdemeanor for those under 18. Nineteen- and 20-year-olds are subject to a civil violation for a first offense but misdemeanor charges for a second or subsequent offense. The bill makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil violation for a first offense in all cases. A third or subsequent offense would subject anyone under 21 to a misdemeanor criminal charge.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A court has ordered police in the nation’s capital to start tracking the race of everyone stopped by officers, regardless of whether the stop results in an arrest or search. News outlets report the Thursday ruling gives the department a month to comply. The D.C. Council passed legislation three years ago that required the department to track race, but it never followed through. Advocacy groups sued the department, its chief and city officials last year over the noncompliance with the Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results act. Chief Peter Newsham says the department planned to implement IT upgrades to comply by next month, regardless of the court order. Superior Court Judge John M. Campbell questioned why a short-term, low-tech measure wasn’t put in place to collect the required data in the meantime.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: An LGBTQ organization has suspended its director while it investigates why four men charged with hate crimes in an anti-gay attack attended the group’s gay pride gala. In a Sunday statement, the Miami-based nonprofit SAVE said it has placed director Tony Lima on administrative leave. Lima said in a Facebook video that the men bought their own tickets after volunteering with the group, but he didn’t consult with board members before welcoming them in his remarks. The South Florida Gay News publication said Lima announced on stage that the men had been “wrongly accused.” Lima said he doesn’t remember saying that, but “if that’s what I said in haste, I apologize.” The four men are accused of attacking two men and shouting anti-gay slurs following last year’s Miami Beach gay pride parade.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Scientists say a warm winter may have given a head start to a shrimp-killing parasite. The Savannah Morning News reports researchers found a shrimp with black gills during a June 21 cruise. Shrimp with black gills are infected with a parasite that can weaken or kill them, especially as water grows warmer and holds less oxygen. Marc Frischer of the University of Georgia’s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography says it’s only the second time that shrimp with visible black gill have been observed in June. He says live shrimp collected are also dying at a high rate “suggesting that we are in the midst of a mortality event.” Frischer says warmer winters, possibly caused by climate change, appear to lead to smaller shrimp catches the following fall.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: A new two-day festival on Kauai aims to explore the influences traditional Hawaiian music has had on traditional folk music, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports. The Kauai Folk Festival, scheduled for Sept. 28-29 in Lihue, is the brainchild of Matt Morelock, a multi-instrumentalist best known as a banjo player. Morelock, who was raised on bluegrass and country music and previously produced a live-performance radio show called the “WDVX Blue Plate Special” in Knoxville, Tennessee, has been trying to grow Kauai’s folk music scene since he and his wife, Hollis Church, moved to Moloaa on the northeastern part of the island eight years ago. While Morelock said it’s commonly known Hawaiians invented Hawaiian-style steel guitar playing, he’s identified other connections, including Hawaiian-style vocal harmonies and yodeling.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador has been elected chairman of the state Republican Party. He defeated former Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Luna by a 111-109 vote Saturday. The chairman is responsible primarily for overseeing the party’s goals of electing Republicans and developing a political game plan for elections. “Let’s stand united, and let’s do the things that are necessary to defeat the real enemy, which is the bad ideas of the other side,” Labrador said. He said more people are moving to Idaho and possibly bringing different views. “You see what’s happening on that national stage, and that stage is moving to the state of Idaho,” he said. Labrador served as a U.S. congressman starting in 2010. He left that position to run for governor in 2018 but lost to now-Gov. Brad Little in the Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Officials in this city home to the women’s baseball team that inspired the 1992 film “A League of Their Own” want to help fund a $7 million museum honoring the role of women in the sport’s history. The city of Rockford’s planning committee agreed last week to provide $20,000 to help kick off construction of the International Women’s Baseball Center. The Rockford Register Star reports that the City Council will likely vote on the plan this week. The museum, hall of fame and training facility will be located near the stadium where the Rockford Peaches played in the 1940s and 1950s as part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The first exhibit will be dedicated to Penny Marshall, who directed the film starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Several new state laws have been set in motion with July’s arrival, from a required high school state government test to allowing wrongfully incarcerated individuals to collect $50,000 a year. Starting Monday, Indiana high schools will have to administer, as part of a mandatory government course, the U.S. naturalization test that’s given to immigrants hoping to become U.S. citizens. An initial plan had proposed that students had to pass the test to earn a high school diploma, but that plan was scrapped. Other new laws include making people who are wrongfully incarcerated eligible to receive $50,000 for each year behind bars once a conviction is vacated due to innocence. Also, the head of the Indiana Department of Education will now be appointed by the governor, starting in 2021.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A summer tradition entering its 28th year will overtake the Iowa State Fairgrounds this week, with more than 4,000 hot rods, muscle cars and other custom rides all on display. The Goodguys Heartland Nationals will run Friday through Sunday, providing visitors with a close-up look at thousands of unique rides produced before 1987. The Des Moines event is one of 18 held nationally by California-based Goodguys Rod & Custom Association. For those needing extra horsepower in their holiday, multiple racing competitions will be held during the three-day event. Cars registered in the show are eligible to compete. There’s also no shortage of traditional summertime family fun, including an apple pie bake-off, watermelon eating competition, live entertainment and July Fourth fireworks.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: State agricultural officials are considering a quarantine to slow the spread of an invasive plant threatening native grasses. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the Kansas Department of Agriculture recently sought public input on a plan to quarantine invasive yellow and Caucasian bluestem grasses. The varieties have invaded all but three counties in the Sunflower State. Declaring the quarantine would prohibit the movement of all seeds, plants or parts of bluestem grasses within or into the state. The move could affect some ranchers who rely on the species when cutting hay to feed livestock. Ron Klataske, who leads environmental nonprofit Audubon of Kansas, supports the proposal, saying bluestems destroy all native plants. Kansas Livestock Association Attorney Aaron Popelka says the group opposes the plan because it could economically hurt producers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: More than two dozen Catholic school students and their parents have lost an initial appeal in challenging a regional health department’s efforts to control a chickenpox outbreak. The students claim the agency’s actions infringed on their religious beliefs. But a three-judge panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals sided with a trial court judge who ruled in April that the Northern Kentucky Health Department acted within its authority. The health agency canceled extracurricular activities and later imposed a temporary ban on school attendance for unvaccinated students as the chickenpox outbreak spread. Last week’s ruling applied to the refusal to impose a temporary injunction on behalf of the Catholic school students and their parents. Their attorney says they’ll appeal to the state Supreme Court.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A NASA official says some crews are working around the clock at the space agency’s rocket factory in the city to meet a fall 2020 test launch deadline for a mega-rocket designed to propel astronauts toward the moon and Mars. Deputy Administrator James Morhard says he recently visited the Michoud Assembly Facility at midnight, and people were working on the engine section for the 212-foot core of the Space Launch System. The other four sections have been assembled, and NASA says the rocket’s core section is 80% complete. Morhard wouldn’t say whether he expects NASA to get the $1.6 billion requested by President Donald Trump for space exploration. He says he’s waiting to see what the Senate does with the proposal.\n\nMaine\n\nEllsworth: Supporters of the sea urchin industry say a federal law change will make it easier to ship the seafood out of state. Maine is the site of a fishery for sea urchins, which are harvested so their roe can be used as food. But members of the industry and some lawmakers have charged over the years that burdensome inspection regulations make it difficult to ship the product where it needs to go. Former Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin and current Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree are among the lawmakers who have called for an ease on those burdens, which sometimes result in the seafood spoiling while awaiting inspections. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says in the Federal Register that it’s amending regulations about importation and exportation of urchins to address the problem.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has suspended a Baltimore judge for six months without pay for “a pattern of discourtesy and uncontrollable incivility.” Judge Devy Patterson Russell’s suspension began Monday. Maryland Court of Appeals Judge Clayton Greene wrote that her behavior “had pervasive effects on the administration of justice.” He wrote that from 2007 to 2015, Russell failed to handle and process search warrant materials properly. Greene also wrote that she instructed a law clerk to destroy warrant materials and repeatedly yelled at court clerks and judges. Greene wrote that Russell’s reinstatement is based on finishing “a complete emotional and behavioral assessment” by a qualified health care professional. Russell has denied wrongdoing, contending the matter amounted to personality disputes that were not sanctionable.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLenox: The Boston Symphony Orchestra’s summer home at Tanglewood has unveiled one of the most transformative new additions in its history. Officials on Friday held a ceremonial ribbon-cutting on the $33 million, four-building Linde Center for Music and Learning. The climate-controlled facility will play an essential role in establishing the 500-plus-acre Tanglewood campus in Lenox and Stockbridge as a year-round facility for the first time in its 80-year history. It includes studio, rehearsal and performance space, including one that can seat up to 270 people. It’s the largest building project at Tanglewood in 25 years since the construction of Seiji Ozawa Hall. It is named for lead donor Joyce Linde, her late husband, Edward, and their family.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Aging care experts are warning that the state’s safety net services for elderly populations are becoming strained as more residents live longer. The Detroit News’ analysis of recently released U.S. Census Bureau data shows that Michigan’s overall population has a median age of nearly 40 years. In 21 of the state’s counties, the median age tops 50 years. Area Agency on Aging of Northwestern Michigan serves some of those counties, and the Traverse City-based nonprofit’s executive director, Heidi Gustine, cautions that the state is about to reach a tipping point, as more baby boomers reach retirement age. Gustine says safety net systems are already buckling as demand for home health care increases with fewer workers to fill the jobs. Aging organizations also need more funding and affordable senior housing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEagan: Parents in the state are complaining that they face long waits and have to drive long distances so their teens can take their driver’s license road tests. Cheree Johnson of Rockford told KSTP-TV she and her 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, had to drive an hour to Eagan to take the test recently because a closer location was booked until October. The Eagan office is now booked into October, too. Other young drivers from the Twin Cities have had to travel more than 100 miles to take their tests. State Rep. Jon Koznick says it shouldn’t be so frustrating. He’s considering whether the Legislature should do something about it next session. Driver and Vehicle Services says it has 110 examiners across Minnesota, with plans to hire seven more.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: People are raising money for two Mississippi Blues Trail markers to commemorate the 1977 plane crash that killed three members of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, their road manager and two pilots. The Enterprise-Journal reports the markers will be unveiled in October – one near the crash site in Gillsburg and the other at Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center in McComb, where survivors were treated. Mike Rounsaville, a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan from northern Mississippi, is raising money, and a GoFundMe page had nearly reached a $10,000 goal by last week. The Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center Foundation is also collecting donations. Lynyrd Skynyrd was founded in Florida and is known for hits such as “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Free Bird.” The current iteration of the band is touring Europe and the U.S. this year.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources has received an $8.6 million federal grant for a new research center. The university announced last week that it had received the grant from the National Institute of Health. The five-year grant will go toward the Swine Somatic Genome Editing Center, where researchers from across the country will use wild pigs to develop delivery methods for gene-editing compounds. The Columbia Missourian reports the center is the latest addition to NIH’s Somatic Cell Gene Editing Consortium, which researches tools for genome editing in human patients. The center will operate out of an existing university research facility after it is renovated to meet federal standards.\n\nMontana\n\nMoiese: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service diverted roughly a third of the National Bison Range Complex’s budget in 2015 and never gave it back. The shrunken budget hobbled staff, slashed Visitor Center hours, and left buildings in disrepair at a place often referred to as the crown jewel of the U.S. National Wildlife Refuge System. A 10-month investigation by the Missoulian charted a years­long funding crunch at this group of National Wildlife Refuges. Fish and Wildlife Service financial records indicate the Bison Range Complex’s annual budget dropped from as much as $2.7 million from 2012 to 2014 to as little as $1.2 million in the years since. By May 2017, Bison Range manager Jeff King was warning his superiors that “we are (past) the muscle and bone and into the marrow on our ability to even manage our highest priorities, and even those things are suffering.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Voters may decide next year whether to legalize casino gambling in a ballot measure that could tip the number of states that allow commercial gambling into the majority. Supporters of legalized casinos have launched a petition drive to place the issue on the 2020 ballot with financial backing from the economic development corporation owned by the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. Twenty-five states – including neighboring Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota – allow commercial casino gambling with games such as slot machines, craps and roulette wheels, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Iowa casinos near Omaha, in particular, cater to Nebraska residents looking to gamble. “Hundreds of millions of dollars go across the border every year,” said Lance Morgan, the CEO of Ho-Chunk Inc., the corporation pushing the measure on the tribe’s behalf.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The state has become the latest to honor the sacrifices of servicemen and servicewomen killed in military service. The Gold Star Families Memorial was dedicated Saturday on the grounds of the recently opened Northern Nevada State Veterans Home in Sparks. The Nevada Appeal reports the black granite memorial has one side for a tribute to Gold Star Families and the other to tell a story on four panels of Homeland, Family, Patriot and Sacrifice. Among the speakers at the event was 96-year-old Hershel “Woody” Williams, a former Marine who earned a Medal of Honor for his heroism at the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Williams said the U.S. has done a good job of recognizing veterans but a very poor job in honoring the families until now.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBretton Woods: The Mount Washington Cog Railway is about to mark its 150th anniversary. Festivities for the July 3 birthday of the world’s first mountain-climbing cog railway are scheduled at the base station from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. There will be a guest booth with goodies from Calef’s General Store in Barrington, a partner property celebrating its own 150th anniversary. There also will be barbecue and birthday cupcakes from local businesses. The day also will include Victorian lawn games and fish feeding at Peppersass Pond, plus a live acoustic guitar performance by Michael Bloom and fireworks at dusk by Andrew Day.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state will consider expanding its beach access regulations to take into account two things every day-tripping beachgoer knows: Being able to access a beach also includes being able to park near it and use a public restroom. Catherine McCabe, the state’s environmental protection commissioner, says her department will take a renewed look later this year at beach access, including the issues of parking and restrooms. Under the administration of former Gov. Jon Corzine, New Jersey required public access points every quarter-mile, plus public restrooms in any shore town that accepted government money for beach replenishment. Those rules were struck down by a court in 2008. The state recently enshrined the Public Trust Doctrine into law, establishing the public’s right to swim in waterways and walk along their shorelines.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The effects of a progressive shift in the state are being felt as new laws take effect that restrict gun access, raise taxes, decriminalize low-level drug possession, and provide a major boost in spending on everything from teacher salaries to road construction. Starting Monday, taxes on vehicle sales rose by 33%. Background checks are required for nearly all firearms purchases, and smaller public bathrooms are becoming gender-neutral. The state also is raising its salaries and channeling more money toward public education initiatives to help at-risk students in response to a court order mandating greater school resources. A windfall from the oil sector will help with increased government spending, as the industry is expected to provide the state with a $1 billion surplus for a second consecutive year.\n\nNew York\n\nHyde Park: Renovations are planned next year at President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s historic home on the Hudson River. The National Historic Site mansion will be closed to tours from April through October 2020 as the building undergoes extensive renovations. The Poughkeepsie Journal reports that the project will include a replacement of the heating and air-conditioning system and exterior painting. It’s slated to cost more than $3.2 million. The grounds of the site, which includes Roosevelt’s burial plot and a museum, will remain open. The National Park Service says about 154,000 visitors came to the Hyde Park site last year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTryon: The effort to preserve music legend Nina Simone’s childhood home now has the backing of a few of the biggest names in entertainment. This month, the National Trust for Historic Preservation kicked off a crowdfunding campaign it hopes will support the rehabilitation of the nearly 90-year-old house where Simone, then known as Eunice Waymon, grew up in Tryon. Members of the public can donate to the campaign in addition to buying new Simone-inspired merchandise designed by artist Dare Coulter and other merchandise donated for the cause by singer John Legend, rapper Talib Kweli and comedian Issa Rae. Funds raised are expected to be integral to restoring the exterior of the home where the “Mississippi Goddam” singer learned to play piano. Others involved in the fundraising effort include singer Yusef/Cat Stevens and Academy Award-winning actor Mahershala Ali.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group that pushed to legalize marijuana in the state last year is back for another try. Legalize ND expects to submit a new proposed initiative to the secretary of state’s office soon. The group’s leader, David Owen, said the new measure will be far more specific than the one that voters soundly defeated in November. The group’s proposal would limit possession to 2 ounces and wouldn’t allow home growing. It also calls for child-resistant packaging and no marketing to children. Owen said it also would prohibit smoking in public or in vehicles. The group needs about 13,450 signatures for the initiative to be approved for next year’s ballot. Owen said he expects signature-gathering to begin in August, several months earlier than last time around.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Researchers say toxin-producing algae have formed in Sandusky Bay and are migrating into Lake Erie near Cedar Point, a signal the lake’s western basin could see massive blooms this summer. The Blade reports an official from Bowling Green State University’s Great Lakes center says tests show toxin levels thus far are relatively low and don’t threaten water treatment systems in lakeside communities. Toxins from an algae bloom in 2014 caused massive problems for Toledo’s lake-fed system. Rick Stumpf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says heavy spring rains have helped push algae from the bay into the lake. Stumpf says that while spring rain has prevented farmers from planting and fertilizing, researchers can study the residual threat of “legacy” phosphorous runoff on the lake’s health.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A community council study reveals that 1 in 5 homeless people in Tulsa was employed last year, including almost 100 people who had no home despite having a full-time job. The Tulsa World reports that data from the Community Service Council study indicates more than 5,600 people were homeless in 2018. The survey found it took people 27 days on average to secure a home, and 65% were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers are partially based on an annual “point in time” census, in which officials counted every homeless person they could find at shelters, on the streets, in alleys and along underpasses. A homelessness coalition noted the number of homeless veterans in Tulsa fell by 16%, mirroring the success of programs that prioritize veterans.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state will pay for prepaid postage on mail-in ballots for next year’s general election in an attempt to boost turnout. The House voted 37-18 on Sunday to allocate nearly $1.7 million to pay postage costs. The program could cost the state more depending on how many voters send in ballots. Oregon switched to a vote-by-mail system in 2000. Gov. Kate Brown made prepaid postage a priority this year. She said low-income and younger residents don’t always have access to postage stamps. Opponents say that the move won’t noticeably increase voter turnout and that the money could be better used elsewhere. Washington state and California also cover postage costs for mail-in ballots.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Legislation to help agriculture in the state is going into effect, including measures to foster younger farmers, help clean water going into Chesapeake Bay and expand butchering services for small farmers. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf signed eight related farm bills in the Capitol on Monday, flanked by state presidents of the Future Farmers of America and the 4-H. The $23 million initiative includes funding for agricultural business development, marketing, educational programs and conservation practices. Money will also go to encourage specialty products such as hardwood, hemp and hops and to build agricultural infrastructure in urban areas. State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding calls it “the most comprehensive investment in agriculture in a generation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is planning a barbecue for veterans with the head of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The Rhode Island Democrat announced Thursday that he’s holding a community conversation and barbeque at the Slater Memorial Park pavilion in Pawtucket. House Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, a California Democrat, plans to attend the July 14 event. It begins at noon. The committee has jurisdiction over legislation for veterans’ health care, benefits and other issues. The event is free and open to Rhode Island veterans and their families. Cicilline asks that attendees RSVP with his Pawtucket office. Representatives from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Office of Veterans Affairs will be there to provide information about resources available to local veterans.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents will pay less to go to the state’s only public law school next year. The State newspaper of Columbia reports that in-state tuition will fall $5,100 next year at the University of South Carolina School of Law, thanks in part to an injection of new money by the General Assembly into public colleges and universities. Law School Dean Robert Wilcox says South Carolina has been losing students to out-of-state law schools because of cost. The full tuition price for law students last year was $29,608. Now it will be $24,508. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Murrell Smith, a Sumter Republican, says lawmakers boosted spending at USC by $8 million this year, with the understanding that $1.9 million would specifically go to lower law school tuition.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has seen an uptick in sales tax revenue following a June 2018 Supreme Court decision that allows it to collect money from online retailers. A new law following that decision, which requires online businesses to pay sales taxes if they conduct at least $100,000 in gross sales in at least 200 transactions in the state, went into effect Nov. 1. Revenue Secretary Jim Terwilliger says business tax licenses issued to out-of-state and online retailers since then have helped South Dakota pocket $15.9 million in tax revenue. Terwilliger says the ruling was a “landmark decision” in tax administration. Thirty-one states have enacted legislation allowing them to collect sales taxes from online businesses.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As of Monday, drivers in the Volunteer State could face a fine up to $200 for using cellphones behind the wheel. All motorists will be prohibited from holding or physically supporting a phone while driving. Hands-free devices will be allowed, including “earpieces, headphone devices or a device worn on a wrist to conduct a voice-based communication,” the legislation says. Dashboard mounts will also be allowed. The state Senate approved the ban 23-7 in April. A driver’s first violation will result in a $50 fine. If the violation is the driver’s third offense or if it results in a wreck, the fine jumps to $100. If the violation occurs in a work zone when workers are present or in a school zone when warning flashers are on, the fine is $200. The bill excludes law enforcement, first responders, utility workers and others using a phone to make an emergency call.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The city is set to bring 10 rainbow crosswalks to a neighborhood known as the historic heart of the city’s LGBTQ scene. The Dallas Morning News reports the city council approved the crosswalk project in the Oak Lawn neighborhood last week as part of $1.4 million in street improvements. Former city council member Chris Luna, one of the city’s first openly gay officials, says the crosswalks will cost $128,000. Luna and the GLBT Chamber of Commerce Foundation raised $70,000 in six weeks for the crosswalk project. He’s also looking to raise another $30,000 for ongoing maintenance. He notes that construction is slated to begin in September and expected to finish by next March. Luna says he believes the project will mark the area as a safe space.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Serving a mission with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will soon be more expensive for many members of the faith. Church leadership sent a letter last week announcing that members will have to pay $500 a month starting in July 2020 for missions in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan. That is a 25% increase from the $400 a month that has been the rate since 2003. The Utah-based religion says the increase is needed because of rising costs of rent, food, utilities and transportation. The proselytizing missions are considered rites of passages for young members of the faith. Men serve two years, while women serve 18 months. There are currently about 67,500 missionaries around the world.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Future state troopers will be allowed to have arm tattoos, if they cover them up. In the past, applicants with tattoos that were visible when wearing short sleeves were not considered for employment. Under a policy update that starts Monday, such applicants would be welcomed but, if hired, would have to cover their arms with department-issued fabric sleeves. The policy continues to prohibit tattoos on the face, neck or hands, except for commitment band tattoos on ring fingers. Officials say that they recognize that tattoos have become more popular and that the new policy will allow the state to recruit a wider pool of applicants.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The National Rifle Association is holding a town hall meeting in the state about a month after the city experienced 2019’s deadliest mass shooting. The Virginian-Pilot reports one town hall was being held Monday, with another scheduled for Tuesday in Belle Haven on the state’s Eastern Shore. The lobbying arm of the NRA planned to focus on proposals that are likely to come up at the July 9 special legislative session that Gov. Ralph Northam convened in the tragedy’s wake. The Democrat said he wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider several gun control measures. Republicans have given little indication they plan to follow Northam’s agenda. Democrats quickly seized on the news of the NRA’s meetings, which some GOP lawmakers may attend.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: New gun regulations taking effect in the state include a ban on undetectable guns made using 3D printers. The Seattle Times reports that a law against so-called ghost guns took effect Monday, along with components of a previously instituted law raising the legal purchase age for some guns. A law passed in January raises the purchase age for semi-automatic rifles to 21. Additional clauses taking effect Monday include enhanced background checks for semi-automatic rifle buyers and a safe gun-storage provision. A gun owner could be charged with community endangerment if a firearm is accessed and used by someone who is not allowed to possess it, such as a child or a felon. Gun-rights advocates have filed a legal challenge against the initiative’s age restriction for semi-automatic rifles.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: NASA is holding a formal ceremony to rename a facility in the state after a mathematician whose calculations helped astronauts return to Earth. The ceremony is set for Tuesday in Fairmont for the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility. Congress passed a bill allowing the name change, and President Donald Trump signed it into law Dec. 11. Johnson, who is now 100, worked at NASA’s Langley Research Center as a human “computer.” She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson in the film “Hidden Figures,” which documented the contributions of her and two other African American women while overcoming racism and sexism. Last year, Johnson was honored by alma mater West Virginia State University with a bronze statue and scholarship dedication.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that gives the state Department of Corrections another six months to close its troubled youth prison. Allegations of guard-on-prisoner abuse have plagued the facility near Irma for years. Legislators last year passed a law forcing the DOC to close the prison by Jan. 1, 2021, and create smaller facilities for juvenile offenders. Evers has said that timetable is too aggressive. He says replacement facilities won’t be ready by then. Republican Rep. Michael Schraa introduced a bill that keeps the prison open until July 1, 2021. The Assembly and Senate approved the bill in June. Evers announced Monday that he signed the bill Friday. He said in a news release that his top priority remains getting kids out of the youth prison.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The final deadline for competitors in a carbon-capture contest has been extended by four months. Carbon XPRIZE Executive Director Marcius Extavour says organizers want to make sure competitors have enough time to demonstrate their technologies. The extension means the final data submission for the $20 million NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE competition is due June 30, 2020. Wyoming Public Radio reports XPRIZE will now announce the winner in September 2020, instead of the spring. The contest seeks to promote technology to put carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant to profitable use. The profits would offset the cost of keeping the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. Five teams will compete in the final round and get to test their ideas at a coal-fired power plant near Gillette.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/world/ichthyosaur-fossil-swiss-alps-scn/index.html", "title": "'Fish lizard' fossils found in Swiss Alps belonged to some of the ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe fossils of giant, extinct marine reptiles have been found in an unlikely place: within the high altitudes of the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe fossils belong to three ichthyosaurs, and they may have been some of the largest animals that ever lived on Earth, according to a new study. The ancient creatures could reach 80 tons and 65 feet (20 meters) in length, rivaling modern sperm whales.\n\nThese “fish lizards” first appeared in the ocean about 250 million years ago, looking a bit like dolphins with elongated bodies and small heads. They emerged after the Permian mass extinction wiped out more than 95% of marine species. But by 200 million years ago, the giant ichthyosaurs were extinct and only the smaller, more dolphin-like ones lived until 90 million years ago.\n\nA study detailing the discovery published Thursday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\nSo how did the remains of massive sea creatures, including one longer than a bowling alley, end up at an altitude of 9,186 feet (2,800 meters)?\n\nAbout 200 million years ago, those rock layers were the floor of a wide lagoon.\n\n“We think that the big ichthyosaurs followed schools of fish into the lagoon. The fossils may also derive from strays that died there,” said study coauthor Heinz Furrer, retired curator at the University of Zurich’s Paleontological Institute and Museum, in a statement.\n\nBut the folding of the Alps, which began 95 million years ago when the African tectonic plate began to push up against the European tectonic plate, created piles of rock layers about 30 to 40 million years ago. The fossils were “tectonically deformed,” squashed by the tectonic plate movements that pushed them to a rock formation at the top of a mountain.\n\n“You have to be kind of a mountain goat to access the relevant beds,” said lead study author P. Martin Sander, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bonn in Germany, in a statement. “They have the vexing property of not occurring below about 8,000 feet (2,438.4 meters), way above the treeline.”\n\nAlthough these creatures once ruled the seas, fossils are rare, which has created a great mystery for paleontologists. But the remains of these ichthyosaurs have shed new light on these enigmatic, extinct creatures.\n\nOne huge tooth\n\nThe fossils belonged to three different ichthyosaurs. One was about 65 feet (20 meters) long while the other was 49 feet (15 meters) long. But the most exciting find associated with these fossils is the largest ichthyosaur tooth ever found.\n\n“This is huge by ichthyosaur standards: Its root was 60 millimeters in diameter — the largest specimen still in a complete skull to date was 20 millimeters and came from an ichthyosaur that was nearly 18 meters (59 feet) long,” Sander said.\n\nScientists know that smaller ichthyosaurs had teeth, but most of the giant ones were toothless, and it was assumed they fed on cephalopods, like squid, through suction.\n\nGiant ichthyosaurs with teeth were likely similar to sperm whales and killer whales today, using their teeth to capture prey like giant squid.\n\nBut the tooth presents a challenge because it was broken off at the crown. While researchers know it was an ichthyosaur tooth because of unique features, like the infolding of dentin in the tooth root, they can’t be sure that the size of the tooth reflects the size of the animal.\n\nThis is the thickest ichthyosaur tooth found so far. Rosi Roth/University of Zurich\n\n“It is hard to say if the tooth is from a large ichthyosaur with giant teeth or from a giant ichthyosaur with average-sized teeth,” Sander said.\n\nThis is because, according to researchers, being giant and being a predator (with teeth) don’t align – which is why the blue whale, which weighs 150 tons and can reach 98 feet (30 meters) long, doesn’t have any teeth. Instead, it filters out tiny creatures from the water.\n\nMeanwhile, sperm whales, which weigh 50 tons and reach 65 feet (20 meters) in length, are hunters.\n\n“Marine predators therefore probably can’t get much bigger than a sperm whale,” Sander said.\n\nGiants in the mountains\n\nThe fossils were first discovered during geological mapping of the Alps between 1976 and 1990. Furrer was part of the original team that recovered the fossils from the rocks, known as the Kössen Formation, and remembers holding the fossils in his hand as a doctoral student at the University of Zurich.\n\nStudy coauthor Heinz Furrer is pictured holding the largest ichthyosaur vertebrae. Rosi Roth/University of Zurich\n\nOver time, the fossils were largely forgotten.\n\n“Recently, though, more remains of giant ichthyosaurs have appeared,” Furrer said. “So it seemed worthwhile to us to analyze the Swiss finds again in more detail as well.”\n\nIchthyosaur fossils have been found around the world, but the remains of giant species have been concentrated in North America. Finding these specimens in modern-day Switzerland expands their range.\n\nPrevious evidence has suggested that some of them could reach the size of blue whales, the largest animal in the world.\n\n“In Nevada, we see the beginnings of true giants, and in the Alps the end,” Sander said. “Only the medium-to-large-sized dolphin – and orca-like forms survived into the Jurassic (Period),” between 145 and 201 million years ago.\n\nSander wonders if there are more “giant sea creatures hidden beneath the glaciers.” But these fossils help fill a knowledge gap about the giant marine lizards.\n\n“It amounts to a major embarrassment for paleontology that we know so little about these giant ichthyosaurs despite the extraordinary size of their fossils,” Sander said. “We hope to rise to this challenge and find new and better fossils soon.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/01/21/sundance-film-festival-2023-best-movies/11091574002/", "title": "Sundance 2023: All the best films we saw at the festival", "text": "Sundance returned in a big way, for those who traveled to Park City, Utah, or – if you're like us – avoided the snow while hanging on the couch.\n\nAfter going virtual for a couple of pandemic-affected editions, Sundance Film Festival 2023 embraced both normalcy and the new with a hybrid in-person/online format.

The insightful deep-drive also showcases her surprising sauciness at 84: “I was a good girl with a bad girl lurking just inside.”\n\n10. 'The Persian Version'\n\nProudly pulverizing the fourth wall and boasting a 1980s pop-music influence, the uplifting dramedy – Sundance's U.S. dramatic audience award winner – centers on a young Iranian-American woman named Leila (Layla Mohammadi) who finds herself an outsider in both cultures as well as her family. Their gathering for a wedding – and her dad's heart transplant surgery – forces Leila and her estranged mother (Niousha Noor) to discover how truly alike they are.\n\n9. 'Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie'\n\nDirector Davis Guggenheim deftly uses clips from the beloved actor's screen work alongside Fox's own insightful words to craft a humorous and moving chronicle of his life, from rocketing to superstardom as an undersized Canadian to dealing with his debilitating Parkinson's disease. Fox tells stories of filming \"Family Ties\" and \"Back to the Future,\" his dive into alcoholism and the pains of his everyday life, exhibiting the same sly sense of humor and charm that made the world fall in love with him in the '80s.\n\n8. 'Talk to Me'\n\nSundance is known for its stellar horror films (\"Get Out,\" \"Hereditary\") and this Australian ghost story is the greatest spook show of the 2023 slate. Teenage Mia (Sophie Wilde) falls in with a crowd that uses a weird embalmed hand to bring spirits into bodies and films the encounters for online viral videos. But when Sophie bends the \"rules\" of the game and is haunted by a familiar face, she and her friends' lives take a ghastly turn in a thriller that that skillfully blends old-school frights with fears for the TikTok generation.\n\n7. 'Little Richard: I Am Everything'\n\nA celebration of the rock legend's career goes hand in hand with how the music industry whitewashed Richard Penniman's considerable influence in this honest and essential documentary. Through archival footage and interviews, the film chronicles the flamboyant performer's early days as a drag act, his superstardom but also a complex life struggling with his queerness and his religion. And if you believe Elvis Presley is the King of Rock 'n' Roll, this will make you rethink who should be on that throne.\n\n6. 'L'immensita'\n\nWhile Penelope Cruz brings a gentle touch and song-and-dance moves to this Italian family drama, it’s newcomer Luana Giuliani who really dazzles. In 1970s Rome, 13-year-old Adriana (Giuliani) starts to identify as a boy, telling mother Clara (Cruz) she feels like an alien from another galaxy. From meetings with a crush to musical fantasies, Adri tries to find herself even as the dynamic with her mom, abusive dad and siblings becomes more unstable in the touching, inclusive coming-of-age tale.\n\n5. 'A Thousand and One'\n\nActress/singer Teyana Taylor proves an emotional powerhouse in A.V. Rockwell's poetic drama about motherhood and a changing New York City. Winner of the fest's U.S. dramatic Grand Jury Prize, the movie casts Taylor as an ex-con who kidnaps her son from foster care in the 1990s and they do what they can to stay together – and keep a secret that could tear them apart – as their personal lives and their increasingly gentrified city change around them.\n\n4. 'Theater Camp'\n\nLike \"Waiting for Guffman\" on an \"Abbott Elementary\" binge, the enjoyable mockumentary centers on the diva kids at an upstate New York theater summer camp. A \"Bye Bye Birdie\" accident puts the owner (Amy Sedaris) in a coma, her influencer-bro son (a hilarious Jimmy Tatro) has no idea how to run it, and two longtime teachers (Ben Platt and Molly Gordon, who also co-directs) can't get past their own egos to finish an original musical. It takes a bit but these high-maintenance theater nerds definitely grow on you.\n\n3. 'Rye Lane'\n\nDom (David Jonsson) is crying over his ex in a unisex bathroom when he meets the carefree Yas (Vivian Oparah), an awkward encounter that sparks a memorable jaunt through colorful London for the two that involves a karaoke bar, a lunch comeuppance, some breaking-and-entering, spicy snacks and revealing conversations (plus one amazing cameo). Raine Allen-Miller's fantastically endearing rom-com freshens the genre while paying tribute to its past, with delightful leads we need to see more of on these shores.\n\n2. 'Cassandro'\n\nThe rousing true-life underdog story casts a never-better Gael García Bernal as Saúl, a gay wrestler in the Mexican luchador circuit who takes off his mask and embraces a new feminine \"exótico\" character. Wearing his mom's clothing, Saúl first weathers homophobic insults, but his passion and flamboyance ultimately win crowds over in a big way. Bernal shines in a heartfelt performance alongside Raúl Castillo as his secret lover and Bad Bunny in a supporting role as a promoter and confidant.\n\n1. 'Magazine Dreams'\n\nIs it too early to start talking 2024 best actor? Jonathan Majors is phenomenal and frightening as a troubled amateur bodybuilder whose life falls apart as he obsessively tries to craft the perfect physique in writer/director Elijah Bynum's intoxicating cautionary tale. Doing for a musclebound world what \"The Wrestler\" did for the squared circle, the film follows Majors' painfully awkward gym rat as he goes down a spectacularly bad path of protein shakes, steroids, rage issues, misplaced idolatry and macho posedowns.\n\nTake a deeper dive on Sundance films:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/21"}]}

Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin. Which party will gain control of the upper chamber?\n\nBut there are other, less high profile but still important races on the Nov. 5 ballot. Voters will get to decide on ranked choice voting in multiple states and in Maine voters will decide whether to change their state flag for the first time in a century.\n\nHere is our guide to some of the most consequential — and interesting — races in all 50 states.\n\n— Melissa Brown and Duane W. Gang, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nLearn more about the races\n\nAlabama | Alaska | Arizona | Arkansas | California | Colorado | Connecticut | Delaware | Florida | Georgia | Hawaii | Idaho | Illinois | Indiana | Iowa | Kansas | Kentucky | Louisiana | Maine | Maryland | Massachusetts | Michigan | Minnesota | Mississippi | Missouri | Montana | Nebraska | Nevada | New Hampshire | New Jersey | New Mexico | New York | North Carolina | North Dakota | Ohio | Oklahoma | Oregon | Pennsylvania | Rhode Island | South Carolina | South Dakota | Tennessee | Texas | Utah | Vermont | Virginia | Washington | West Virginia | Wisconsin | Wyoming |\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican Caroleene Dobson, Democrat Shomari Figures\n\nWhat's at stake: Alabama’s congressional map was redrawn in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the proposed Alabama congressional district map was gerrymandered, discriminating against Black voters in the case of Allen v. Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation found no noncitizens were voting in the state’s elections, lawmaker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/10/09/ny-marijuana-legalization-lobbying-wars-spotlight-cannabis-business/1575513002/", "title": "NY marijuana legalization lobbying wars spotlight cannabis business", "text": "Marijuana companies spent about $3 million on lobbying in New York over five years\n\nMedical and recreational marijuana businesses are valued at $8 billion across the US\n\nOne critic charged that some lobbying groups are fronts for full recreational pot legalization\n\nMedical and recreational marijuana generated $2 billion in taxes last year\n\nMarijuana companies and promoters spent about $3 million on lobbying in New York over five years, targeting medical cannabis and the recreational pot debate.\n\nAimed at New York regulators and politicians, the money flowed from powerful West Coast cannabis investors and Midwest medical marijuana empires as well as politically connected East Coast pot players and start-ups.\n\nYet caught in the lobbying crossfire are parents like Susan Salomone, who lost her son Justin, a former Marist College student, to a heroin overdose, and now speaks at schools about the scourge of addiction.\n\nWhen students argue marijuana legalization in some states means it isn't dangerous, Salomone shows them a picture of her sons.\n\n\"I tell them 'Three of these boys experimented with marijuana and one of them died of a heroin overdose,' \" the Mahopac resident said, \"It's not going to be everybody but you don't know if it's going to be you.\"\n\nAmid the lobbying, advocacy and political pressure, Gov. Andrew Cuomo changed course on legalizing marijuana after years of opposition. He signed New York’s medical marijuana law in 2014 and launched a recreational pot study this year.\n\nAt Cuomo’s behest, the state health department pot study recommended New York should pursue recreational marijuana legalization, a stance currently being debated at listening sessions statewide. The final session is scheduled to be held in New Rochelle on Oct. 17.\n\nVireo Health and Etain, the medical marijuana companies in Westchester and Ulster counties, ranked among the top lobbying spenders in New York. Citiva Medical also ranked high and has plans to open a Dutchess County dispensary.\n\nInformed of the lobbying tally, marijuana opponents criticized New York leaders for yielding to influence peddlers driving drug laws in 30 states with medical cannabis and nine with recreational pot.\n\n“The pot industry sees political giving as the price of doing business,” said Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana. “We’re worried they are simply manipulating the process with money.”\n\nPro-cannabis groups, however, described lobbying as necessary to end marijuana prohibition that keeps medicine from seriously ill patients and recreational use in the shadows.\n\n“States around the country are demonstrating that regulating marijuana works,” said Mason Tvert, a Marijuana Policy Project spokesman. “It allows folks to purchase marijuana safely, legally and from licensed, taxed businesses, rather than on the illegal market.”\n\nTo understand the stakes, consider the $8 billion valuation for medical and recreational marijuana businesses across the country, and the $2 billion they generated in taxes last year.\n\nStrikingly, the cannabis lobbying in New York rivaled spending in Washington, D.C., where lobbyists push reforms to federal laws that treat marijuana like heroin and cocaine.\n\nIn order to spotlight the marijuana dealings of lobbyists, politicians and regulators behind the scenes, The Poughkeepsie Journal/Journal News reviewed public ethics records, interviewed industry leaders and advocacy groups.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nAbout $1 million went to marijuana-related lobbying since 2017, while New York loosened restrictions on medical marijuana and considered recreational legislation.\n\nThat spending outpaced the $2 million between 2013 and 2016, as questions mounted over medical marijuana licenses going to top spenders and patients struggled to access medicine.\n\nMuch of the lobbying cited specific medical marijuana legislation, but $290,000 didn’t list many details and was difficult to evaluate. Another $50,000 listed general marijuana policy reforms and adult-use legislation.\n\nIn addition to lobbying, some California-based marijuana players made campaign donations to Cuomo, including $90,000 as the health department worked on its recreational pot report.\n\nSome medical marijuana companies have voiced support for New York legalizing pot, but few have openly discussed if they plan to sell recreational drugs here.\n\nMedical and recreational\n\nMuch of the marijuana legalization debate sits at the crossroads of medical and recreational drugs.\n\nEverything began when California became the first state to allow medical marijuana in the 1990s, despite the fact it remained illegal under federal law. In 2014, New York became the 21st state to follow the example.\n\nSeemingly riding the medical use green wave, Colorado and Washington became the first two states to allow recreational pot in 2012. Seven more states have since legalized it and many others are currently debating the issue, including New Jersey.\n\nYet anti-legalization advocate Sabet says New York crossed a critical policy line in pushing recreational pot: It has the first state health department that recommends recreational marijuana.\n\nIn a detailed rebuttal, Smart Approaches to Marijuana raised concerns about New York’s health department using questionable data and downplaying public safety risks, such as marijuana use by pregnant women and youths.\n\nSabet described the stage agency’s report as more a lobbying byproduct than an independent government assessment.\n\n“It’s striking to me that the department of health wrote this report … I thought I was reading the website of a pro-marijuana industry group,” Sabet said.\n\nHealth Department officials wouldn’t discuss the issue and described the marijuana report as an unbiased study of the issue.\n\n“This comprehensive report, which includes a wide variety of credible evidence on both sides of the issue, concluded that the positive impact of a regulated marijuana market in New York state outweighs the potential negative aspects,” said Jill Montag, agency spokeswoman.\n\nSalomone, the mother who co-founded Drug Crisis in Our Backyard, described the support of recreational pot as counterproductive to efforts to curb New York's drug epidemic.\n\n\"It’s unbelievable to me because the governor's spending millions of dollars on this heroin epidemic and now we're legalizing marijuana, does any of it make any sense?\" she said.\n\nStill, health department officials noted a panel of experts from medical, government and law enforcement backgrounds consulted on the recreational pot report.\n\nYet some health care groups, such as the Medical Society of the State of New York, disagreed with the state agency’s conclusions on legalizing recreational pot, including that it’s all but inevitable because other states already allow it.\n\n“Pundits often joke about public policy, ‘you can lead the train, be on the train, or be under the train,’ ” said Dr. Thomas Madejski, the society’s president. “I’m concerned that further expansion of non-medicinal marijuana usage in New York state may lead to a train wreck.”\n\nConcerns about New Yorkers crossing into other states to smoke legal weed, however, are rooted in the history of teens jumping between New York, Connecticut and New Jersey for alcohol when the legal drinking age differed in the 1970s.\n\nThe lobbying breakdown\n\nIt is difficult to determine how much New York lobbying money focused on recreational marijuana because state ethics laws don’t require many details.\n\nWhile many lobbying filings disclosed medical marijuana as the issue, some reported no specific legislation was involved. Others didn’t describe issues or referred to general health care and budgetary issues.\n\nSmart Approaches to Marijuana argued there is a blurred line between lobbying for medical and recreational marijuana for some companies and advocates.\n\n“We’re finding a lot of these medical groups are just a front for full recreational legalization, and they are buying up smaller maybe more legitimate medical outfits, so they can expand and grow,” Sabet said.\n\nMarijuana legalization advocate Tvert disputed Sabet’s characterization of support for medical cannabis.\n\n“The notion of it being a Trojan Horse is absurd…it is something widely established in the scientific and medical communities that is widely supported by the public and elected officials,” Tvert said, adding recreational use focuses on different issues.\n\n“Once people come to recognize that marijuana is a less harmful substance than alcohol, they tend to agree that it should be treated that way,” he said.\n\nOne issue with parsing New York lobbying, however, is that the same state agency, the health department, regulates medical marijuana and issued a report supporting recreational pot legislation.\n\nAbout $320,000 in marijuana lobbying listed the health department as a target, although a majority noted it planned to focus on medical use.\n\nThe California connection\n\nFew of the lobbying spenders in New York have clear connections to recreational marijuana.\n\nOne is MedMen Inc., formerly Bloomfield Industries Inc. and an affiliate of its namesake cannabis conglomerate that has medical and recreational sites in California and Nevada.\n\nMedMen spent tens of thousands of dollars lobbying medical marijuana in New York, but one of its filings this year disclosed plans to push recreational pot. It noted contract info was unknown at the time of the filing.\n\nFurther, MedMen’s investment arm and principal, Andrew Modlin, donated $90,000 to Cuomo’s gubernatorial campaign fund this year, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe campaign donations came as the state health department worked on its recreational pot report and medical marijuana review. In fact, $15,000 was donated on July 12, the day the agency added opioid-related health conditions as eligible for medical cannabis. The next day, the recreational pot report was released.\n\nFurther, another $50,000 campaign donation to Cuomo seemed to be connected to MedMen in December 2017. It listed the donor as Project Compassion NY LLC and had the same address as a MedMen lobbying filing at the time. The money flowed the month before Cuomo launched the recreational pot study.\n\nCuomo didn’t respond to an interview request about why he changed positions on medical and recreational marijuana.\n\nMedMen wouldn’t discuss lobbying and political donations in New York.\n\nSabet described the campaign donations as another example of money influencing marijuana policy.\n\n“The process should be fair, not driven by who has the most money,” he said, adding the anti-legislation group recently opened an office in New York City to focus on organizing the mounting opposition to recreational pot legislation.\n\n“We’re being contacted daily by people who don’t want their apartment buildings full of pot smoke, who don’t want more dangerous roads due to impaired driving, and who don’t want to be hoodwinked by a new industry that will act as irresponsibly as Big Pharma or Big Tobacco,” he said.\n\nSalomone, who also serves on a statewide anti-opioid task force handpicked by Cuomo, noted her advocacy group is not opposed to medical marijuana.\n\n\"We’re against recreational marijuana, it’s just another gateway drug,\" she said, \"Why do we have to put another drug out there for kids to get addicted to?\"\n\nThe Hudson Valley players\n\nAnother New York company tied to recreational pot is Citiva Medical, which plans to open a Dutchess County medical marijuana dispensary next year.\n\nIt is affiliated with the pot conglomerate, iAnthus Capital, with medical and recreational operations in Colorado and Massachusetts and other states.\n\nCitiva is building a 39,500-square-foot medical marijuana grow operation in Orange County, and is poised to add recreational weed, if its legalized.\n\n“We’ve been investing heavily in our grow facility…so we can be ready for the recreational market,” said Amy Holdener, a Citiva spokeswoman.\n\nCitiva spent about $160,000 lobbying marijuana in New York, citing “health care issues” on some filings without listing specific legislation.\n\nHoldener said she was unaware of any Citiva lobbying focused on recreational pot here, but added legalization seemed like an inevitability at this point.\n\nThe company’s biggest concern appeared to be finding a way to beat out illicit drug dealers currently meeting New York’s pot demands.\n\n“The biggest challenge in the recreational market in New York is the competition with the black market,” Holdener said.\n\nNew York City's marijuana use, for instance, topped a ranking of global cities in 2017. It consumed about 77 metric tons, or 170,000 pounds, of pot that year, USA Today reported.\n\nThe Dutchess dispensary would be the third such facility in the mid-Hudson Valley, with dispensaries already operating in Kingston and Newburgh.\n\nWestchester County-based Etain, is another company with plans to expand into recreational markets. It recently partnered with companies selling cannabis in California.\n\nEtain spent about $394,500 lobbing in New York, and executives say none of it focused on recreational marijuana issues.\n\n“When the time is right and we are ready as an organization, we will join the conversation about recreational,” said Chief Operating Officer Hillary Peckham. “But as of now, Etain has not formalized an official position/policy on recreational use in New York state.”\n\nMany of the lobbying spenders have investors with varied interests. One is Vireo Health and its recent Canadian public offering that attracted money from offshore locales known for fiscal secrecy.\n\nVireo spokesman Andrew Mangini said the company agreed with the state health department’s report on recreational pot. He didn’t answer questions about Vireo’s lobbying and business plans related to the issue.\n\n“Legalization will not only help reduce opioid deaths and discrimination against people of color, but also bring substantial tax revenue to the state,” he said. “It’s time to end the war on drugs and create an environment in which New York patients and adult consumers have safe and legal access to marijuana.”\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nDrugs look like candy: What to know about cannabis edibles this Halloween\n\nValley Views: Governor should slow down on legalizing marijuana\n\nEDITORIAL: N.Y. health officials make compelling case to legalize pot\n\nMedical marijuana dispensary in Newburgh sees growth in business", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/us/oregon-psilocybin-voter-pushback-ctrp/index.html", "title": "It's legal to use psilocybin, or 'magic mushrooms,' in Oregon. But that ...", "text": "Jackson County, Oregon CNN —\n\nFirst came Chrissi DelaCruz’s tough breakup with her boyfriend of nine years.\n\nThen, her sister died.\n\nThe pain and loss led DelaCruz to traditional talk therapy. She also relied on alcohol.\n\nBut nothing really worked.\n\n“I was feeling pretty sad and lonely and disconnected and was feeling pretty lost and hopeless in what I needed to do next in my life,” the 37-year-old told CNN.\n\nHer next option would be a remedy the commercial real estate professional never imagined she’d end up advocating – and one that, while considered a therapeutic and healing drug by a growing number of health care professionals, has come under fire in Oregon ahead of next week’s election.\n\nPsilocybin, also known as “magic mushrooms,” is a psychedelic used for centuries in ceremonies by traditional cultures, and interest in it by the modern medical and scientific community has grown since the ’50s.\n\nChrissi DelaCruz, a commercial real estate professional from California, went on a psilocybin retreat. CNN\n\nDelaCruz signed up to try psilocybin to treat her mental health challenges in Jamaica – where using psychedelics is legal – on a retreat run by a company founded by an attorney in Oregon, where voters more than two years ago legalized its use on a protracted timeline, with licensing procedures set to launch in January.\n\nAs that date approaches, though, ballot measures Tuesday in roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities propose banning the psychedelic over concerns of a fraught rollout and problems it could stoke, from the substance’s effect on users to possible community consequences.\n\nOpposing the bans and trying to educate voters about psilocybin are Oregonians – including the operator of the Jamaica center, Silo Wellness – who want to set up facilities in the state where it could be used under the strict guidelines already in place.\n\nBefore her Jamaica retreat, DelaCruz also wasn’t sure about psilocybin, even as Silo Wellness pledged an experience with psychedelics that would help find “peace and purpose.”\n\n“I was totally nervous,” she admitted. “I didn’t know what to expect.”\n\nHow brain systems ‘move and groove together’\n\nScientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health. What is known is that just like common antidepressants called SSRIs, psilocybin attaches to receptors in the brain that trigger the release of serotonin, the “feel good” hormone.\n\nBut unlike antidepressants, which take at least a week to work and have to be taken daily, a psilocybin “trip” may improve mood in just one or two sessions. A single treatment with psilocybin reduced negative mood in people with treatment-resistant depression within three weeks, new research found.\n\n“One of the most interesting things we’ve learned about the classic psychedelics is that they have a dramatic effect on the way brain systems synchronize, or move and groove together,” Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told CNN earlier this year.\n\nA common theory is the drugs somehow break down the brain’s typical boundaries, so parts of the brain that don’t normally connect to each other suddenly do. At the same time, areas of the brain locked into a cycle of depressive thoughts quiet. This may create a type of expanded consciousness, experts say, that appears to allow the depressed person to break free of self-criticism and see new possibilities.\n\nPsilocybin can be taken in a pill form, smoked, ground and mixed with other foods, put into a smoothie or liquid, or even infused into chocolates and other sweets. A typical dose is a 25-milligram pill, which creates the full-blown psychedelic experience.\n\nDuring most psilocybin studies, trained counselors are present to establish a supportive setting, set expectations and stop the trip from turning “bad,” which might feel like losing oneself or going crazy. They also help the person undergoing the experience organize and retain their new outlook on life via talk therapy.\n\nDelaCruz and about a dozen others who met medical qualifications for the Silo Wellness retreat convened online regularly beginning two months before arriving in Jamaica in June to begin the five-day experience.\n\nIt included two psilocybin dosing sessions, dubbed “ceremonies.”\n\nDelaCruz had it “in a powder form that was mixed with, like, a juice,” she said.\n\nAfter 15 or 20 minutes, it took effect.\n\n“It’s almost like I could see the life in everything around me,” she recalled. “It sounds weird, but it’s like (I could) feel what it really is like to feel alive.”\n\nOne of the sessions was “very hard” and “very emotional,” she said. But despite the increased anxiety and discomfort, it also was very effective.\n\n“The biggest change was, I have more trust and confidence in myself through these ceremonies, therefore that allows me to reflect that back in my actions and in my thoughts and how I affect other people,” DelaCruz said.\n\n“That proved to me that everything that I need to heal is within myself.”\n\n‘There’s no magic here’\n\nThe process, according to Silo Wellness CEO Mike Arnold, isn’t fun.\n\n“(It) can be very, very uncomfortable most of the time, and you have to put in the work, too. So, after you’re done with it, even if you have a great session and you feel like you’re connected to nature and everything’s beautiful and easy … still, you gotta put in the work afterward.\n\n“Like, there’s no magic here.”\n\nArnold founded Silo Wellness in 2018 after having what he described as a life-changing experience with psilocybin, then started the retreats in Jamaica.\n\nHow psilocybin may rewire the brain\n\nIn addition to a strict intake process that screens for underlying medical issues that might be worsened by psilocybin – such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – medical professionals on-site throughout the retreat keep close watch over participants before, during and after the ceremonies, he said.\n\n“I think drugs are not the answer to anything,” Arnold said, but “certain molecules can be a tool to finding the answers if used appropriately and responsibly and safely.”\n\nPlanning for centers to take root in Oregon\n\nIn 2020, Oregon became the first US state to legalize psilocybin for personal use for those over age 21. More than 1.2 million residents, or 55.7% of voters, voted in favor of legalizing it, with most of those opposed living in the rural eastern and southern parts of the state.\n\nYet unlike cannabis, which in Oregon and other states can be used at home, psilocybin must be administered at licensed “service centers” under the direction of trained “facilitators,” who must meet criteria including age and residency and pass regulations exams and background checks but need not have a medical background. Not required to be on hand in Oregon are counselors or therapists who support talk therapy and could help avert a “bad” trip.\n\nThough the vote was two years ago, the application process to become a service center or facilitator is slated to start in January, and participants would have to complete a “preparation session” before receiving any psilocybin and have a designated driver after treatment. The rules also require any center to have a safety and security plan in place for each client and allow for, but do not require, a “client support person” to be present during the session.\n\nEven under the tight rules, Arnold wants to bring Silo Wellness’s Jamaica retreat model to Oregon and has identified New Frontier Ranch in rural southern Jackson County as an ideal setting. He’d grow the mushrooms on-site in a small, indoor, lab-like space – separate from living quarters – where a bathtub-sized container could supply his retreats for an entire year.\n\nFarmer Jason Lampman wants to open a psilocybin \"service center.\" CNN\n\nFarther north, in McMinnville, Oregon, farmer Jason Lampman is eyeing the potential on a much smaller scale. He’s hoping to make his 1-acre orchard a psilocybin “service center” and treat people on-site, growing the mushrooms in a retrofitted shipping container and hosting clients for a few hours each in a yurt.\n\n“There are laws and rules that are written out,” Lampman said. “This is safe, (and) it is extremely expensive to get into this and there are very strict rules.”\n\nLampman estimates he’ll spend nearly $50,000 to get licensed and trained, in addition to building infrastructure to comply. He hopes he’ll be able to recoup the investment swiftly and add to profits from his other small crops, like hemp, hazelnuts and apples.\n\nAsked if he worries about giving doses of psilocybin on the same property where his wife and their three toddlers live, Lampman pointed directly across the street to his neighbor’s lush vineyard.\n\n“There’s a winery right there,” he said. “People can drink as much alcohol as they want and drive down this road. I think that’s a way more concerning conversation that I’m gonna have.”\n\nFor some, this brings back bad memories\n\nWhile Oregon legalized psilocybin use more than two years ago, roughly a third of the state’s counties and cities are now proposing ballot measures Tuesday to ban the psychedelic in their communities.\n\n“We just want to say no; we want to opt out for a while,” said Stayton Mayor Henry Porter. “The health, safety and welfare of the community, that’s my main responsibility.”\n\nAfter seven terms as mayor and more than three decades as a high school civics teacher, Porter’s worry is rooted in the lingering unknowns surrounding psilocybin, he said, adding he fears the January start date for state applications is too soon.\n\n“I don’t know what it does. I don’t know how it would be controlled. I don’t know how to keep kids away from it,” he said. “I guess it’s the fear of things we don’t understand.”\n\nA neighbor of New Frontier Ranch, where Arnold hopes to set up his retreat, echoes a similar concern.\n\n“I don’t really know a lot about it. … That’s part of the problem,” said Mary Anne Crandall, who supports a local ban on psilocybin following the rocky 2015 cannabis rollout. She and others in Jackson County recalled promises by lawmakers and cannabis advocates that legalization of that drug would eradicate cartel influence and stop illegal grows.\n\nInstead, Crandall said, “it’s made it worse,” adding they’ve seen an influx of human trafficking and a depletion of water resources.\n\nStill reeling, “we feel like we don’t have a voice in what’s going on” now with psilocybin, Crandall said.\n\nOregon officials did not respond to CNN’s specific questions about human trafficking and water use in the marijuana industry but recently started requiring those working on grow farms to report suspected human and sex trafficking.\n\nMeantime, Angela Allbee, who helps manage the Oregon Psilocybin Services Section of the state’s public health division, acknowledged “many lessons learned” from the state’s cannabis rollout and touted the robust rulemaking and feedback processes implemented this time around for psilocybin.\n\nA rush to educate voters\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday’s election, Mike Arnold and other psilocybin advocates are urgently educating voters on the industry as he envisions it.\n\n“These folks are scared and they’re concerned and rightfully so because they had experiences with another ballot measure that promised good things that didn’t necessarily deliver,” he said.\n\nArnold is confident the rollout for psilocybin will not be a repeat of cannabis in Oregon – in part, he argued, because of where the profit is made.\n\n“It comes down to the economic basis of the two industries: Cannabis is a product, a commodity,” he said. “And psilocybin is a service industry.”\n\nIt’s a service Chrissi DelaCruz views not only as mind-altering but also life-changing.\n\n“There were a lot of different reasons (I went on the Jamaica retreat), and it was not to just go and trip out and have a good time,” DelaCruz said. “I was battling internally.”\n\n“It was a big release for me, and there definitely was a lot of processing and healing that I was able to do during the ceremony and then especially afterward, too,” she said.\n\nSince the retreat, DelaCruz has reconciled with her longtime partner and no longer finds herself incessantly seeking external validation. She’s also reduced her reliance on alcohol.\n\n“And that’s just because I feel better without it now,” she said.", "authors": ["David Culver Jason Kravarik", "David Culver", "Jason Kravarik"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/11/monuments-restored-gifted-program-ending-stripe-shortage-news-around-states/119039482/", "title": "Monuments restored, gifted program ending: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: A $15 million expansion will add a lot more space to Space Camp, with Boeing making a $3.5 million donation toward the project at the state-run U.S. Space and Rocket Center. Officials held a groundbreaking ceremony Friday for the more than 40,000-square-foot building, which will include a 1,000-seat auditorium, 10 classrooms, laboratories and a permanent home for U.S. Cyber Camp, which focuses on computer technology. Other companies and individuals made additional donations, and the state provided an economic development grant for construction, which officials said would cost about 40% more than first anticipated because of increased costs for materials and labor. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the project, which already is underway and is set to open in March 2023.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A man upset over the impeachment of former President Donald Trump, illegal immigration and the direction he thinks the country is headed is accused of threatening the lives of the state’s two Republican U.S. senators in a series of profanity-laced voicemails that included saying he would hire an assassin to kill one. “Your life is worth $5,000, that’s all it’s worth,” a message left at the office of Sen. Lisa Murkowski said. “And as you let in these terrorists, assassins, guess what? I’m going to use them. I’m going to hire them.” In a voicemail to Sen. Dan Sullivan, the caller vowed to use “illegals for target practice,” assistant U.S. Attorney General Ryan Tansey said. Some of the voicemails were played in U.S. District Court in Fairbanks on Friday during the first appearance for Jay Allen Johnson, 65, who moved to rural Delta Junction, Alaska, from Texas in 2019. The retired man had earlier ties to the Fairbanks area. Johnson’s wife, Catherine Pousson-Johnson, testified on her husband’s behalf in trying to have him released, detailing a series of recent surgeries he’s had: “He’s in pain right now. My husband is an old man, and he gets very angry listening to politics on the news.” Tansey later asked her if she was aware her husband was making threats against two U.S. senators. “Who hasn’t?” she replied.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Child-welfare officials considering whether to terminate parental rights of inmates facing long prison terms have a constitutional duty to offer reunification services to those prisoners who want to try to keep their children, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. Though Arizona law doesn’t require the state to offer reunification services to help maintain bonds between prisoner-parents and children, it’s necessary because a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision said parents have a “fundamental liberty interest” in the care, custody and management of their children, the Arizona justices said. They acknowledged that their ruling’s requirement for offering reunification services to prisoners serving long sentences departs from a 2005 state Court of Appeals ruling. It’d be difficult to maintain parental relationships while separated, “but an incarcerated parent can maintain a bond with a child in other ways, such as through visits, phone calls, letters, pictures, and gifts,” the ruling said. The justices considered the reunification issue as part of a father’s appeal of a juvenile court’s termination of his parental rights to two young children. Though the court misapplied two legal standards, other circumstances and the childens’ best interests still warranted termination so that they could be adopted by a family, the ruling said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers on Friday rejected legislation preventing businesses from requiring employees to say whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19, after the House speaker and business groups said it would have devastating consequences. The majority-Republican House voted 41-46 in favor of the Senate-backed bill, which would have created a “right of privacy” for employees and contractors regarding their vaccination status. The proposal, which would allow employees to sue under the state’s civil rights law for any violations, was among attempts to limit or prohibit vaccine requirements in response to President Joe Biden’s order that businesses with more than 100 employees must require vaccinations or weekly coronavirus testing. But the measure faced opposition from business groups and hospitals, as well as GOP legislative leaders who said it went too far in restricting businesses. Speaker Matthew Shepherd told House members before the vote that the bill was “an overreach.” Opponents said it would force businesses to choose between exposing themselves to lawsuits by workers or facing federal fines for not complying with Biden’s order. They also said it would have jeopardized Medicaid and Medicare funding for health care facilities and stopped them from preventing infections and contact tracing.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVisalia: Marie Wilcox, a Native American who saved her tribe’s dying language, has died. She was 87. Wilcox was once the last fluent speaker of Wukchumni, but she worked for more than 20 years to produce a dictionary of the language spoken by her tribe in the San Joaquin Valley and taught her family. Now there are at least three fluent speakers of the language, including her daughter. Wilcox died Sept. 25 in a Visalia hospital after her aorta ruptured. Her great hope was for the language work she started to continue, her daughter, Jennifer Malone, told the Fresno Bee. “Her dream for us was to keep it going,” Malone said on the eve of her mother’s memorial service Friday in Tulare County. “So no matter what, we will do this and teach as many people as are willing to learn.” A Wukchumni dictionary Wilcox wrote was copyrighted, and her family is now looking for a publisher for it, Malone said. The Wukchumni are one of the numerous tribes under the larger umbrella of the Yokuts, Indigenous people in the central San Joaquin Valley. But unlike other Yokuts tribes that are recognized by the federal government, the Wukchumni lack federal status and resources for cultural preservation. Wilcox regularly taught Wukchumni language classes through the Owens Valley Career Development Center. The classes will continue.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Civil rights groups have filed to block the state’s new congressional map, arguing the independent redistricting commission that redrew the legislative boundaries to match population growth shortchanged Hispanic residents. The filings Friday from the Colorado Latino Leadership, Advocacy and Research Organization and the League of United Latin American Citizens contend the commission continued to dilute the power of Latino voters by following traditional congressional maps in the state, which have separated heavily Hispanic areas. They argue that Latinos – who are 21% of Colorado’s population – are scattered among several congressional districts, mixed in with white residents who vote against their preferred candidates. The groups pleaded for the commission to group Latinos together by, for example, splitting the city of Colorado Springs and attaching its heavily Latino southern end to a southern Colorado district including Pueblo and the San Luis Valley. The commission balked at that, preferring to preserve what are known as “communities of interest” – cities and neighborhoods with shared needs. When it submitted the maps, the commission told the court they complied with the federal Voting Rights Act and did not discriminate against any voter on basis of ethnicity or language.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A lawmaker is standing by comments that compared Gov. Ned Lamont and his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic to Adolf Hitler. Republican state Rep. Anne Dauphinais initially posted a comment on Facebook on Thursday night that called the Democrat “King Lamont aka Hitler.” Dauphinais posted a longer comment on her Facebook page Friday night that mentioned Nazi concentration camps, book burnings and other actions under Hitler, interspersed with mentions of Lamont’s mandates during the pandemic. “This Governor, with the help of the one-party rule we have in this state right now, has taken dictatorial powers for himself for what will be almost 2 full years when this latest extension expires,” Dauphinais wrote. “Hitler too was a dictator enabled by the rule of the single Nazi party.” Max Reiss, Lamont’s communications director, called the comments “disgusting, repulsive and disrespectful to the history and memory of victims of the Holocaust,” the New Haven Register reports. An email message was left with Dauphinais on Sunday. Her district includes Plainfield and Killingly in eastern Connecticut.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s chain pharmacies are facing a severe staff shortage. Employees at Walgreens and CVS describe chaotic stores with desperate customers waiting in hours­long lines and phone calls that go unanswered. Amalia Lucci said she was surprised to see a closed sign citing “a shortage of employees” at a CVS pharmacy when she went to pick up an antibiotic for her daughter at 4 p.m. “While the door was closed, I saw someone still inside and knocked,” Lucci said. “After explaining my situation, I was able to get the medication, but I could tell he (pharmacist) was really stressed.” Another customer, Mae-Lyn Smith, had to wait more than an hour when she went to pick up medication. “It was not a situation where I could shop around or wait until next day,” Smith said. In social media posts, pharmacists described understaffed pharmacies, customers lashing out during long waits and workers quitting out of stress. “Unfortunately a pharmacy can not be open unless there is a licensed pharmacist and we currently just do not have the pharmacist to staff our pharmacy,” a Walgreens manager, Melissa Anne, wrote in a Facebook post. A number of Walgreens pharmacies have stopped opening on weekends, while many 24-hour stores, mainly in southern Delaware, have reduced operating hours.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Former President Donald Trump’s company lost more than $70 million on his Washington hotel during his four years in office despite taking in millions from foreign governments, according to documents released Friday by a congressional committee investigating his business. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform said the luxury hotel just a few blocks from the White House was struggling so badly that the Trump Organization had to inject $27 million from other parts of its business and got preferential treatment from a major lender to delay payments on a $170 million loan. The committee said the losses came despite an estimated $3.7 million in revenue from foreign governments, business that ethics experts say Trump should have refused because it posed conflicts of interest with his role as president. The Trump Organization said in a statement that the findings of the Democrat-led committee were misleading and false, and it did not receive any special treatment from a lender. Trump’s company has been trying to sell the 263-room hotel since fall 2019 but has struggled to find buyers during the coronavirus pandemic at a reported initial asking price of more than $500 million.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Augustine: A house connected to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is now in the hands of a couple who plan to preserve it. David Manaute and Patti Barry live near 5480 Atlantic View already and were familiar with the house’s history. A historical marker stands on the property, which is on the coastline several miles south of St. Augustine. During the 1960s, King came to St. Augustine to advance the civil rights movement and stayed in different places around town to maintain his safety. The Atlantic View home was the target of attacks by people who apparently thought King was staying there. A bullet hole is still in one of the door frames. Before the shooting, the St. Augustine Record printed the address of the cottage after getting a tip that he was staying there, according to historian David Colburn’s book “Racial Change & Community Crisis.” King wasn’t in the home at the time of the shooting. But he arrived later, and a photo showing him looking at a bullet hole in glass became “one of the iconic images of the civil rights movement,” according to the marker at the property, which is from the ACCORD Freedom Trail. The home was the winter residence of missionaries who supported the civil rights movement, who opened the house to King, according to information from ACCORD.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The unique experience of racing on a runway at one of the world’s busiest airports is back this year. The Mayor’s 5K on the 5th Runway returns Saturday after being canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The airport says it’s “one of the flattest – and fastest – courses in metro Atlanta.” With the pandemic ongoing, masks are required before and after the race. While planes will continue to take off and land on the other runways, the 9,000-foot fifth runway, isolated on the far south side of the airfield, will be cleared. The race course goes down the runway and a taxiway. The race starts at 6:30 a.m., and all participants must clear the runway by 7:30 a.m. so airport workers can sweep the area and prepare for flights to start landing again about 8 a.m., the newspaper reports. Proceeds from the race registration fee go to the Mayor’s Youth Scholarship Program and United Way of Greater Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city will soon begin allowing a limited number of fans at University of Hawaii football games and other outdoor entertainment events as it begins to ease restrictions protecting the community from COVID-19. Gov. David Ige and Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said Friday that they were taking the steps in response to improving public health data, including rising vaccination rates and declining numbers of coronavirus cases, hospitalized patients and test positivity rates. Starting Wednesday, outdoor venues may have up to 1,000 attendees or fill up to 50% of capacity – whichever is smaller. For the next Hawaii football home game Oct. 23, attendees will likely be limited to family and friends of players. Attendees will need to be vaccinated, wear masks and maintain physical distance. No food will be allowed, and water will be the only authorized beverage. Restrictions on indoor entertainment, outdoor weddings and funerals, golf tournaments, road races and triathlons will also be eased. Ige said the goal was to manage Hawaii’s health care infrastructure while taking prudent risks and building back the state’s economy. “This is not an all-clear signal. The pandemic is far from finished in Hawaii, in the nation and around the world,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former state lawmaker charged with rape has been arrested and jailed. Online records show Aaron von Ehlinger was booked into the Ada County Jail on Friday afternoon, KBOI-TV reports. He is facing charges of rape and forcible penetration by use of a foreign object. He was arrested in Georgia on Sept. 25 on a “fugitive from justice” charge in connection with a warrant in the case. Von Ehlinger was a Republican state representative from Lewiston when a 19-year-old legislative intern reported he brought her to his apartment under false pretenses and raped her. Previously, von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintained he had consensual sexual contact with her. A legislative ethics committee found that von Ehlinger engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Idaho Statehouse. He resigned from office before the vote was held. The Idaho warrant, issued Sept. 9, would have allowed him to be out of custody after his arrest as long as he posted bond. But von Ehlinger did not turn himself in over the subsequent two weeks. If he is convicted of the charges, von Ehlinger could face up to life in prison and be required to register as a sex offender.\n\nIllinois\n\nDePue: Efforts to change the roughly 200-year-old, racist name of a creek in northern Illinois have gained traction. An 11-mile waterway was named Negro Creek after the DePue area’s first Black settler built a cabin at the mouth of the creek in 1829. DePue is about 110 miles southwest of Chicago. Former resident Amy Urbanowski, who is among those pushing for the name change, has received support from the Bureau County Board and a local NAACP branch. She sent the details to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which approves such changes. In the coming weeks, the agency will consider changing the name to Adams, the surname of the Black pioneer. Records of a first name haven’t been located. “Changing the name of the creek is important,” she said, “because it’s good to reflect on how the names of towns and villages are all historically and respectively named after people, not their race.” Urbanowski and others say they’ve heard people refer to the creek by a racial slur over the years. Ladd Village President Frank Cattani said he played on the creek as a child. At an August public meeting about the name change, he used a racial slur several times in describing the waterway, saying that’s how many people still refer to it and insisting that the term “means ‘Black,’ not ‘Black person.’ ”\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: A second spill in less than two weeks at a U.S. Steel plant sent an oily sheen onto a Lake Michigan tributary, prompting officials to close some nearby lake access as a precaution. The sheen was detected Thursday morning on Burns Waterway outside the U.S. Steel Midwest plant in Portage, but by 8 p.m. it was no longer present on the tributary, said company spokeswoman Amanda Malkowski. She said an existing boom had contained the sheen in an estimated 120-square-foot area, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management was investigating, spokesman Barry Sneed said. As a precaution, the Indiana Dunes National Park closed access to the lake Thursday off the neighboring Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk, said spokesman Bruce Rowe. The nearby community of Ogden Dunes also shut down access to Lake Michigan from its beach, a town official said. Indiana American Water’s Ogden Dunes water treatment facility remained online, and the spill wasn’t expected to impact its Lake Michigan source water, spokesman Joe Loughmiller said. The water utility had idled that treatment plant for about a week starting in late September after U.S. Steel’s Portage plant discharged iron-tainted wastewater into the Burns Waterway.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has extended an order that will prevent state officials from enforcing a law that prohibits school districts from implementing mask requirements until a federal lawsuit challenging the law can be heard. Judge Robert Pratt had earlier issued a temporary restraining order preventing Gov. Kim Reynolds and Department of Education Director Ann Lebo from enforcing the law Reynolds signed in May. The order entered Friday issues a preliminary injunction that continues to prohibit the state from enforcing the law until the court case can be decided. Lawyers for Reynolds and Lebo immediately filed notice of an appeal with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which could reverse Pratt’s order or keep it in place. “We will never stop fighting for the rights of parents to decide what is best for their children and to uphold state laws enacted by our elected legislators,” Reynolds said in a statement. Eleven parents and The Arc of Iowa, a group that defends the civil rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, sued the state Sept. 3. They claim that the law substantially increases the risk of several children with health conditions of contracting COVID-19 and that it violates federal laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Amid a shortage of glass beads triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the white lines being painted on the state’s highways this year tend not to reflect light as well as officials would like. Still, the smaller glass beads being used to accomplish that purpose should nevertheless be “adequate” and “safe,” said Tony Menke, bureau chief of construction and materials for the Kansas Department of Transportation. “We’ll just probably need to touch them up sooner rather than later,” he said. The reduced brightness results from a nationwide shortage of glass beads of the type the state embeds in roadways to enhance the reflectivity of pavement striping, Menke said. Those beads, placed on top of white lines to help drivers see at night, reflect light back in the direction of the oncoming car’s headlights. Medical-grade oxygen is required to produce the beads, Menke said. But the current spike in COVID-19 cases and the resulting need for oxygen for patients have reduced the rate at which the beads can be produced, he said. In addition, a nationwide shortage of chemicals used to create traffic line paint may prevent all roads Shawnee County maintains that need striping from getting redone this fall, Niehaus said. “We’ll prioritize and get the most-needed segments completed,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge ruled Friday that the Kentucky Constitution prohibits a part of a new state law enabling donors to get tax credits for supporting private school tuition. Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd said the state cannot implement the “school choice” elements of House Bill 563. The ruling prohibits the creation of any account-granting organizations or education opportunity accounts, nor can the state grant any tax credits for these purposes. Many students could indeed benefit from the legislation’s financial assistance, the judge acknowledged, but he said that points to another constitutional failure. “The very fact that so many children need additional educational assistance, beyond what is presently funded and appropriated for the public schools, is an indication that we, as a state, may well be falling short of the constitutional mandate of ‘an efficient system of common schools,’ ” Shepherd wrote. The law’s opponents objected to using the state tax code to aid private education. Attorneys defending the law argued that tax credits don’t amount to government spending, even if they decrease revenues. Lawyers with the Institute for Justice, which intervened in Kentucky’s suit, said they will appeal. The legislation was passed over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto this year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Citing sharp declines in COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations, Louisiana State University announced Friday that it will no longer require proof of vaccinations or negative coronavirus tests to enter Tiger Stadium for football games. Fans still will have to wear masks in any indoor areas of the stadium as required under Gov. John Bel Edwards’ statewide mask mandate. Dr. Catherine O’Neal, chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital and a coronavirus adviser to the university, said the state is seeing less than 5% of virus tests returning positive statewide as Louisiana exits its fourth and worst-yet surge of the pandemic. “Because of this success, we are able to lift the vaccine and testing requirements for entry into Tiger Stadium. By balancing mitigation efforts and risk in the ongoing fight to end the pandemic, we can protect our community and safely celebrate the traditions that bring us together,” O’Neal said in the statement released by LSU. Several people who attended football games had said the university’s compliance checks for proof of vaccination or testing had been spotty at best. Meanwhile, Edwards is no longer pursuing efforts to mandate regular virus testing for thousands of state workers who aren’t vaccinated.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine Preservation has added a historic church and a shuttered ski lodge to its list of most endangered historic places in the state. New entries on the nonprofit organization’s annual list, released Thursday, include First Congregational Church in East Machias and the Sugarloaf Summit Lodge in Carrabassett Valley. The hexagonal Summit Lodge atop Sugarloaf Mountain dates to the 1960s and stood at the terminus of the now-defunct gondola lift. It was open to Appalachian Trail backpackers before it closed altogether in 2009. McCurdy’s Smokehouse in Lubec, the Frank J. Wood Bridge between Topsham and Brunswick, and the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta remain on the list, which marked its 25th anniversary. “Advocating for the preservation of historic buildings requires an understanding that our work does not happen overnight and oftentimes necessitates a long-term commitment,” said Tara Kelly, executive director of Maine Preservation. Maine Preservation does list some success stories that have been helped by the organization’s work, including Saco Mill No. 4 and the Wood Island Life Saving Station at Kittery Point.\n\nMaryland\n\nCapitol Heights: Two staff members were fatally shot Friday at an apartment complex for seniors just outside the nation’s capital, and a suspect was taken into custody, police said. The shooting happened shortly after 9 a.m. at Gateway Village in Capitol Heights, Prince George’s County and Capitol Heights police said. Both victims were women – one found in a hallway and another in an office, they said. A resident who identified himself only as Donald said the shooter is his friend and lived in the complex. He said the man was fed up with how residents have been treated. “He told me, ‘Don, nobody is standing up for these seniors. I can’t take it no more. I’ve got to do something.’ And obviously what he chose to do is wrong, but he did something,” the resident said. Gateway Village is one of 310 communities in 25 states run by National Church Residences, which describes itself as “the nation’s largest provider of affordable senior housing and services.” Its website says the apartment complex about a half-mile east of Washington includes studio and one-bedroom units for “seniors age 62+.” A county website describes the property as subsidized government housing for seniors with low incomes. National Church Residences spokeswoman Cindy Young said it’s “extremely heartbroken” that two staff members were killed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city has broken ground on a new memorial to honor the state’s first Black and Indigenous Superior Court judge and all Black veterans. The park in the city’s Roxbury neighborhood is already named after Justice Edward O. Gourdin, but the state on Thursday began the effort to add an 8-foot bronze cast statue of Gourdin and 10 bas-reliefs representing Black soldiers in 10 wars, starting with the American Revolution. Before he became a judge, Gourdin, a Seminole, was an Olympian and a soldier. He won a silver medal in the long jump in the 1924 Paris Olympics and served as commanding officer of the Army’s segregated 372nd Infantry Regiment during World War II. After his discharge, he was a member of the National Guard until 1959, rising to the rank of brigadier general, the first Black soldier to earn the rank in Massachusetts. Gourdin had undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University. Meanwhile, Native American groups marched and rallied on Boston Common on Saturday to observe Indigenous Peoples Day and to call on state leaders to do more to support their communities. Organizers say they want Gov. Charlie Baker to make Indigenous People’s Day a statewide holiday. They also want Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park in Boston’s North End to be renamed.\n\nMichigan\n\nColoma: A rural amusement park that was popular for decades in southwestern Michigan is on the auction block. Visitors could pet animals, ride a Ferris wheel or train, and listen to music at Deer Forest in Coloma. The 25-acre site in Berrien County is for sale, along with many buildings that are in rough shape but still standing. “Perhaps residential might make sense for whomever buys it,” said Rick Levin of Rick Levin & Associates, who is handling the sale. “I don’t know if the best use is a zoo and fun park anymore, but we’ve had a lot of people calling with their fond memories of going here.” The suggested opening bid is $450,000, though the property had been valued at $3.2 million, Levin said. The deadline for the sealed bid auction is 4 p.m. EDT Thursday. Cecil Potts founded the park in 1949. By 1989, more than 3.5 million people had visited Deer Forest, The Herald-Palladium reports. It has been closed since 2014. Rachel Edwards of Coloma fondly remembers a small red house known as Santa’s Summer Village. “You’d go inside and imagine it was where Santa went in the summer for vacation. There was even a sleigh you could sit in. … I know it would take a lot of work, but I would love for whomever buys it to reopen it,” Edwards told MLive.com.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Prosecutors are seeking approval for a more severe penalty than what is outlined in state guidelines if a former suburban police officer is convicted in the shooting death of Daunte Wright. Ex-Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter is facing charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Wright, who was shot while he was trying to drive away from officers during a traffic stop in April. The sentencing guidelines for first-degree manslaughter range from 6 to 81/ 2 years in prison. Potter has pleaded not guilty. She is scheduled to stand trial in December. The prosecutors’ move is similar to one made by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in the trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, convicted in George Floyd’s death. In that case, a judge approved Ellison’s request for an upward departure because Floyd was particularly vulnerable and because Chauvin abused his authority as a police officer. Ellison wrote in a court document filed Wednesday that Potter “caused a greater-than-normal danger to the safety of other people” because she fired into a vehicle with a passenger, and two officers were standing close to the vehicle. Potter is recorded on bodycam video an instant after the shooting saying she mistakenly drew her firearm instead of her stun gun.\n\nMississippi\n\nWinona: Civil rights advocates asked federal appeals court judges Friday to revive a lawsuit they filed against a prosecutor accused of routinely rejecting Black jurors in criminal cases simply because of their race. District Attorney Doug Evans’ jury selection tactics have been under scrutiny for years. His exclusion of Black jurors in one high-profile murder case led to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Curtis Flowers’ conviction in 2019, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh citing a “relentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals.” Friday’s arguments at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans involve a lawsuit focused not on a specific case but on the overall practice of using race as a sole reason for rejecting jurors. It was filed in 2019 by leaders of the Attala County branch of the NAACP and four Mississippi voters, including one who was rejected as a jury candidate in Flowers’ case. They asked a federal judge to declare Evans’ policy unconstitutional and issue an injunction preventing him and his staff from making race-based jury strikes. U.S. District Judge Debra Brown, while acknowledging the plaintiffs’ claims may have merit, dismissed the lawsuit in September 2020, saying an injunction would put the federal court in the improper role of conducting an “ongoing audit” of state court proceedings.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: As some jobs go unfilled, billboards popping up around the city admonish that it’s time to “Get Off Your Butt!” and “Get. To. Work.” The signs that also urge people to “Apply Anywhere” are paid for by a group of business owners, including Brad Parke, who say they’re frustrated. “We don’t know where people are,” said Parke, general manager of Greek Corner Screen Printing and Embroidery. “Obviously they’re not at work. Apparently they’re at home. So that’s where we came up with ‘Get Off Your Butt.’ And then the ‘Apply Anywhere’ is about everyone’s looking for employees. You can’t drive a block through a commercial district without someone having a sign saying ‘Now Hiring.’ ” KYTV reports that the workforce shortage is a major problem in all sectors, affecting the supply chain for all kinds of goods and services, despite the Greene County Commission reporting a record-low unemployment rate at 2.8%. Parke said the billboard company that put up the ad has already been getting feedback. “He said they typically don’t get people calling in about billboards,” Parke said. “But someone called and said, ‘I don’t know who paid for that billboard, but that’s awesome!’ ”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State-employed public health experts say the state’s health department used “misleading and false” claims in support of an emergency rule that urged schools to consider parental input when adopting rules for wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Eighteen epidemiologists wrote to Adam Meier, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services, saying the Aug. 31 rule “threatens the credibility” of the health department and will “negatively impact our ability to communicate with Montanans in the future,” the epidemiologists wrote in a letter Sept. 17. The rule said schools that mandate face coverings in classrooms “should … be able to demonstrate they considered parental concerns in adopting the mandate” and allow students to opt out based on “physical, mental, emotional or psychosocial health concerns, as well as on the basis of religious belief, moral conviction or other fundamental right.” Along with the rule, Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office released a 13-page report citing studies, news stories and social media posts saying there is “no science behind mask mandates for children” and warned of negative effects for some children wearing masks. The epidemiologists’ letter said that ignored “numerous peer-reviewed studies.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A contract agreement has been reached between the state and its public employees that will provide significant pay hikes, particularly to those working in some health care and high-demand jobs, the Nebraska governor’s office announced Friday. State leaders and the Nebraska Association of Public Employees reached an agreement in principle, meaning it has not yet been ratified. The new contract would include $47 million in new compensation, officials said. The union represents more than 8,000 public employees in agencies throughout the state. “The agreement represents a substantial increase in pay for our members working within 24/7 facilities and across state government,” NAPE Executive Director Justin Hubly said. The new agreement would amend the 2021-23 contract to give covered state employees at 24-hour-a-day facilities a $3-per-hour pay increase. Also, starting Nov. 1, it provides a 20% increase pay line adjustment for jobs classified as high demand and a 30% increase pay line adjustment for health care workers identified as critical. The agreement also would increase overtime pay at 24/7 facilities and provide for an additional 2% cost-of-living adjustment July 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a shortage of school bus drivers, 15 high schools in and around the city will start having students ride regularly scheduled public transit to and from campus this week. Clark County School District officials announced last week that the “Ride On” program starts Monday with the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. Officials promised safe and timely transportation, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Students will board RTC buses at stops near their homes to ride existing routes, along with regular riders, to stops near school, officials said. The RTC said 200 security officers patrol bus stops and transit centers, and each bus has 12 cameras that police can monitor live. Parents have complained since school began Aug. 9 about frequent bus delays and unpredictable service causing some students to miss classes. The sprawling district with 366 schools usually operates almost 1,600 bus routes but has about 240 school bus driver vacancies. Last month, officials canceled some high school sports games due to transportation issues.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu asked the Department of Veterans Affairs on Friday to “follow through on their promise” to purchase millions of heavy-duty rubber gloves procured by a New Hampshire company in response to a pandemic-related request for personal protective equipment. In a letter to Secretary Denis McDonough, Sununu said the secretary’s office reached out in October 2020 to the company, Gigunda Group, “to locate, procure and ultimately provide funding” for 500 million gloves. The company has helped the VA with other PPE requests, including $7.4 million worth of nasal swabs. “At that time, locating 10 million or 20 million nitrile gloves was a big deal,” Sununu wrote. “Gigunda was tasked with searching the globe to locate a supplier that could provide 500 million gloves and with capability to provide as many as 2.5 billion over time.” Since then, Sununu said he learned the VA’s procurement arm claims no such request was made. “This is unacceptable,” he wrote. “Over 20 million nitrile gloves have been sitting in Gigunda’s TSA secure facility since May, and yet the VA has chosen to ignore and deny the existence of this successful partnership,” he wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeal: A coalition of environmental and fishing groups says the state should drop a plan to double the amount of money it spends on beach replenishment, asserting that money could be better spent on more effective ways to protect the state from climate change. Standing on a beach in Deal, a Monmouth County shore town due to get new sand as part of a $26 million replenishment project next month, the groups on Thursday decried New Jersey’s plan to increase the amount of money it spends on shore protection from $25 million to $50 million a year. They say that money would be better spent on measures to address repetitive flooding in the northern and central parts of the state along the Raritan and other rivers that often sustain catastrophic damage during storms like Tropical Storm Ida. “Given what just happened with Ida, if the state has an extra $25 million to spend on resiliency or preparing for climate change impacts, should we really be spending it putting sand on the beach in front of wealthy peoples’ second homes?” asked Mike Castellano, chairman of the Jersey Shore chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. Twenty-one groups signed a statement urging the state to reject a bill already passed by the state Senate but awaiting action in the Assembly that would double shore protection funding.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: After a four-year hiatus, state election regulators have resumed spot-checks on campaign finance disclosures by politicians, election candidates and political committees, with 10 accounts referred to New Mexico’s fledgling State Ethics Commission and state prosecutors for possible enforcement action. The random sampling of campaign finance disclosures from the 2020 general election cycle taps into a newly deployed electronic campaign finance reporting system at the Secretary of State’s Office that reconciles an intricate web of campaign contributions, transfers and expenditures. State law requires an annual sampling of 10% of accounts, triggering a review of roughly 110 accounts. Results were published Friday. Regulators attributed the hiatus in part to scarce resources. Alleged violations included groups receiving contributions from unidentified sources and failing to register as political committees. In addition to the 10 referrals, six committees or candidates are currently working to resolve discrepancies with the secretary of state’s office. The agency focuses on education and voluntary compliance.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city will phase out its program for gifted and talented students that critics say favors white and Asian American students, while enrolling disproportionately few Black and Latino children. Starting in the next school year, the nation’s largest school system will stop giving 4-year-olds a screening test used to identify gifted and talented students, according to an outline of the plan released by the city’s education department Friday. The program currently admits only 2,500 pupils a year out of 65,000 kindergartners citywide. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the change will help tens of thousands get advanced instruction, instead of just a select few. “The era of judging 4-year-olds based on a single test is over,” he said in a statement. “Every New York City child deserves to reach their full potential, and this new, equitable model gives them that chance.” The city will instead train all kindergarten teachers to provide accelerated learning in which students use more advanced skills such as robotics, computer coding, community organizing or advocacy on projects while staying in their regular classrooms. The city will also screen students going into third grade to determine if they would benefit from accelerated learning in various subjects while staying in their classrooms.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A county governing board has formally apologized for the mob lynching of a Black boy unlawfully taken from a jail in 1921, saying it suspected some prominent local officials allowed the killing to take place. A report issued Tuesday by the Chatham County Board of Commissioners found no investigation ever was conducted to find out who killed Eugene Daniel, 16, but evidence suggests a county commissioner, the county sheriff, the county coroner and the county jail keeper at the time all were complicit in the death. “The lynching of Eugene Daniel is a painful part of Chatham County’s history, and while our apology can’t change what happened, we feel it is an important step in helping his family and our entire community heal,” Chatham County Commissioner Karen Howard said, according to local news reports. News accounts from the time reported Daniel was accused of trespassing inside a home where a white woman said she saw a Black man standing in her bedroom. Daniel was killed by a mob of residents near Moore’s Bridge outside Pittsboro, about 35 miles west of the capital. According to the Raleigh News & Observer, it is unknown exactly how many people were lynched in North Carolina, but researchers say there could have been as many as 300 such killings from 1882 to 1968.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A lawmaker from southeastern North Dakota who’s accused of misdemeanor theft in Bottineau County said Saturday that he’s surprised by the charge and believes it’s fabricated. Republican Sen. Jason Heitkamp, of Wahpeton, said he was in Bottineau last week to retrieve some of his belongings from his former girlfriend and did not steal anything. He said he had been served with a summons but had not seen a copy of the complaint. “I have literally not seen the charges or what I am being accused of, so I can’t say much,” he said. “I’ll be open and honest with everybody, but I don’t know what’s happening. I have no reason to steal anything because I have everything I need.” Heitkamp, 56, recently completed his first year in the Legislature. He is a member of the judiciary and political subdivisions standing committees and the human services and water topics overview interim committees. He previously served on the Richland County Commission, Bottineau City Council and Prairie Rose City Council. Heitkamp said he did not yet have an attorney. His first court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 2. “I will be exonerated from it,” Heitkamp said. “I am not guilty. Just say it out.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The former director of a county jail where federal authorities described conditions as “inhumane” was sentenced Friday to serve nine months in that same jail. A Cuyahoga County sheriff’s deputy handcuffed Kenneth Mills in a Cleveland courtroom, as Visiting Judge Patricia Cosgrove chastized him while delivering the sentence. “What you’ve done is unthinkable and callous,” Cosgrove told Mills. “I don’t know how you can look at yourself in a mirror.” Conditions worsened during Mills’ four-year tenure, prosecutors said, with inmates living in unsanitary conditions with little or no medical care and inedible food while locked in their cells for periods of 24 hours or more. Prosecutors said Mills fronted a money-making plan to have the jail in downtown Cleveland serve as a regional corrections facility that would charge suburbs and Cleveland to house their prisoners. The regionalization plan led to severe overcrowding and forced corrections officers to work in intolerable conditions, prosecutors said. Mills, 56, was convicted in September on misdemeanor counts of dereliction of duty for having caused unsafe conditions in the jail and falsification for having lied to Cuyahoga County Council when he said he had not blocked the hiring of badly needed jail nurses despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An advocacy group filed two initiative petitions related to marijuana Thursday, one of which creates the framework to allow cannabis sales without a doctor’s recommendation. The other makes changes to current medical marijuana laws. If the petitions withstand any legal challenges, Oklahomans for Responsible Cannabis Action would have 90 days to gather 178,000 signatures for each proposal. If enough signatures are collected, the proposed constitutional amendments would appear on a statewide ballot. The recreational petition would let anyone 21 or older grow, purchase, transport, receive, prepare and consume marijuana and marijuana products. The proposed amendment sets limits on amounts over which a business license would be required. Recreational cannabis would be taxed at no more than 15%, compared to the current 7% excise tax on medical marijuana. If the petition passes, the tax on medical marijuana would be phased out over a year. Anyone serving time for a marijuana-related conviction could ask the court for resentencing or dismissal, according to the proposed ballot initiative. The second petition filed Thursday proposed replacing the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority with a standalone agency, the Oklahoma State Cannabis Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A judge has rejected a request by 33 Oregon State Police troopers to temporarily halt a mandate that requires them to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18. Retired Oregon Supreme Court Justice Jack Landau said in an opinion Thursday that based on case law, “the police power of the state includes the authority to enact public health laws that may have the effect of curtailing individual rights,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Landau, who is presiding over the troopers’ lawsuit in Jefferson County Circuit Court, also said Gov. Kate Brown is acting within her legislatively granted authority in issuing the mandate. Brown has required vaccinations for the state’s executive branch employees, including the troopers, and for hundreds of thousands of health care workers and K-12 educators and volunteers. Religious or medical exemptions can be requested. At least eight lawsuits have been filed. Thursday’s ruling is the second that denies plaintiffs’ request to temporarily stop the mandates. On Tuesday, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that arguments made by a group of 25 health care workers, firefighters and paramedics who are opposed to vaccination have “little-to-no likelihood of success” if hashed out in further court proceedings.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A state court ruling will allow a plywood box to remain – for the moment – over a statue of Christopher Columbus that the city has been trying to remove from a south Philadelphia park since the explorer became a focus amid nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the Commonwealth Court ruling late Saturday night vacated a decision earlier in the day by a Common Pleas Court judge to allow immediate removal of the box covering the statue on Marconi Plaza. City representative Kevin Lessard said Saturday night that removal of the covering during the holiday weekend “would pose a serious public safety risk.” He earlier said officials would stop any attempt to remove the covering prior to the state court hearing. Attorney George Bochetto, who represents supporters of the 144-year-old statue, had vowed that it would be visible by the time a scheduled Sunday parade concluded at the plaza. In Philadelphia, a city with a deep Italian heritage, supporters say they consider Columbus an emblem of that heritage. Mayor Jim Kenney said Columbus was venerated for centuries as an explorer but had a “much more infamous” history, enslaving Indigenous people and imposing punishments such as severing limbs or even death.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: Protesters are planning to gather near the newly erected statue of one of the state’s earliest English settlers Monday to demand that it be taken down. Members of the Narragansett Indian tribe, Native Green, NCAAP Providence and Black Lives Matter Rhode Island are expected to gather at the Rev. William Blackstone statue in Pawtucket on Indigenous Peoples Day. “A big Band-Aid has been taken off of many things in this country and exposed things that were so ugly, so now is the time for healing,” Bella Noka, a Narragansett elder, told WPRI-TV. “But you don’t try to put that dirty, nasty Band-Aid back on the wound that’s healing, and that’s what they did with this statue.” Blackstone – after whom the Blackstone Valley region is named – settled the area in the 1630s at a time when the Indigenous population was brutally oppressed. The 14-foot statue was put up in August by the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council Inc. on a private plot of land. The council said it is trying to spur conversation and understanding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: Horry County will likely become the latest government in the state to ban digging deep holes in the sand at the beach. The County Council unanimously gave key approval earlier this month banning digging holes deeper than 2 feet on beaches. It faces one final vote later this month, The Sun News reports. Supporters said deep holes are dangerous to people walking on the beach who may not see them and fall down and also are a hazard to sea turtles. A number of other South Carolina beach governments have passed similar bans on digging holes, including Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head Island Kiawah Island and Surfside Beach.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBlack Hawk: Residents of a neighborhood where a sinkhole appeared last year say they are tired of waiting for answers and, in some cases, feel abandoned by politicians who received their votes in previous elections. “This was our nest egg,” Valerie Smith said. “We planned to sell, and now that’s our house, our business. We’re ready to retire, and we don’t know what to do.” Smith and her husband, Cole, still live in their home on Prairie Violet Lane in Hideaway Hills, where a sinkhole exposed an abandoned gypsum mine April 27, 2020. About 40 people from 15 homes were forced to evacuate. Since the sinkhole opened, two law firms representing more than 100 residents filed lawsuits and performed tests and studies. One law firm is trying to receive class-action certification, the Rapid City Journal reports. Smith said residents haven’t heard from local or state government officials, which only adds to the deepening frustration in Hideaway Hills. “I wish our Gov. Kristi Noem would do something for us,” she said. “It wouldn’t take that much to fix our neighborhood versus worrying about big fireworks displays. Why don’t you take the millions (of tax dollars) and fix neighborhoods for the people that actually voted for you?”\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Country star Dolly Parton and her Smoky Mountain businesses have raised $700,000 to help residents affected by catastrophic flooding in Middle Tennessee. According to a Wednesday news release, Parton chose United Way of Humphreys County to receive and distribute the donation at the suggestion of her friend and fellow country music legend Loretta Lynn. A foreman at Lynn’s ranch was among those who died in the flood. Parton said she was compelled to help out after the support the Smokies received following the 2016 Sevier County wildfires. “I hope that this money can be put to good use to help the people of Middle Tennessee with what they need during their recovery,” Parton said in a statement. During the Aug. 21 flood, more than 500 homes and 50 businesses were damaged after up to 17 inches of rain fell in less than 24 hours over a weekend in the rural community.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state Senate on Friday approved newly drawn district maps that would keep Republicans dominant in the state’s congressional representation, even amid rapidly shifting demographics. Next the maps will go to the GOP-dominated Texas House of Representatives, where they are expected to be approved before reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk to be signed into law. Minority rights groups and Democrats say the Republican mapmakers are ignoring demographic trends. More than 9 in 10 of the 4 million people who moved to Texas over the past decade are people of color. Texas is now home to more than 29 million people, the latest census figures show. America’s largest red state is second in population to California, which is home to nearly 40 million. That growth led to Texas gaining two more seats in Congress, for a total of 38 representatives. Republicans currently have 23 of Texas’ congressional seats, while Democrats have 13. Under the proposed maps, the number of Hispanic-majority districts would shrink from eight to seven. There would also be no districts with a majority of Black residents. State Senator Joan Huffman, a Republican and the chair of the Senate’s redistricting committee, said the maps were drawn fairly and “blind to race.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: President Joe Biden on Friday restored two sprawling national monuments in southern Utah, reversing a decision by President Donald Trump that opened for mining and other development hundreds of thousands of acres of rugged lands sacred to Native Americans and home to ancient cliff dwellings and petroglyphs. The Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments encompass more than 3.2 million acres and were created by Democratic administrations under a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historic, geographically or culturally important. “This may be the easiest thing I’ve ever done so far as president – I mean it,” a smiling Biden said at a White House ceremony attended by Democratic lawmakers, tribal leaders and environmentalists. Restoring the monuments’ boundaries and protections restores their integrity, upholds efforts to honor the federal trust responsibility to tribal nations, and conserves the lands and waters for future generations, Biden said. Bears Ears in particular was an important site to protect, Biden said, noting that the 1.3 million-acre site is the first national monument to be established at the request of federally recognized tribes. It is “a place of healing … a place of reverence and a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of native peoples,” Biden said.\n\nVermont\n\nRoyalton: A federal judge heard arguments Friday about whether a private institution, Vermont Law School, has a right to conceal two large murals against the artist’s wishes because some members of the school community find them racially offensive. Artist Samuel Kerson painted the murals – “Vermont, The Underground Railroad” and “Vermont and the Fugitive Slave” – for the school on two walls inside a building in 1994. Last year the school said it would paint over them and, when the artist objected, said it would instead cover the murals with acoustic tiles. “Despite its beneficent intentions, the mural has not aged well,” the school said in a court filing in response to a lawsuit filed by Kerson. “Its depiction of African Americans strikes some viewers as caricatured and offensive, and the mural has become a source of discord and distraction at Vermont Law School – an institution whose explicit mission it is to educate students in a diverse community.” Lawyers for Kerson, who lives in Quebec, argued in court papers that the artwork is protected by the Visual Rights Act that safeguards artists’ works from “distortion, mutilation, or other modification … which would be prejudicial to (their) honor or reputation.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Negotiations broke down Friday between members of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on which proposed maps they should use as a starting point. The meeting ended after Democratic citizen co-chair Greta Harris left. The impasse came just two days before the commission was supposed to turn in maps for Virginia’s state House and Senate districts. “At this point, I don’t feel as though all members on the commission are sincere in their willingness to compromise and create fair maps for the Commonwealth of Virginia,” Harris said before leaving. A number of other members also left, effectively ending the meeting because it lacked a quorum. Others wanted to push on. Harris said in an email that she did not resign from the commission and had only left the meeting. The commission is tasked with dividing the state’s voters into new legislative and congressional districts, while also trying to ensure that Black and minority voters are given a fair shot to elect candidates of their choice. The 16-member commission is evenly split between Democratic and Republican appointees. And it was already struggling to break a partisan divide before Friday’s impasse.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Residents who sued the Snohomish County Auditor seeking an audit of the 2020 election because of alleged but undocumented “electronic manipulation” of ballots could square off with lawyers for the state Democratic Party. On Wednesday, state party lawyers filed motions to intervene in the lawsuits filed by Republican voters in eight counties including Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, Clark, Whatcom, Lincoln and Franklin, The Daily Herald reports. They want all the cases tossed out. “This lawsuit is entirely unfounded and appears to be little more than a coordinated political attack on the integrity of Washington elections,” lawyers for the Democrats wrote in a motion filed in the Snohomish County case. “Plaintiffs stand before the Court with nothing but speculation, fueled by conspiracy theories, asking for breathtaking and entirely unwarranted ‘relief.’ ” The lead plaintiff in all the suits is Washington Election Integrity Coalition United, whose leader, Tamborine Borrelli of Gig Harbor, traveled the state in search of residents willing to join in. The original lawsuits allege auditors used uncertified voting equipment and manipulated thousands of ballots in an unspecified statewide race. Each lawsuit seeks a “full forensic audit” conducted like one in Arizona that found no evidence of fraud.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The death toll continues to surge from the coronavirus pandemic, according to state health data released Friday. There were at least 115 new COVID-19 deaths reported during the first seven days of October, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That follows a September toll of about 600 deaths – more than the four previous months combined. The state is on pace to surpass 4,000 total deaths from the pandemic this week. On Sept. 21, state officials warned that a surge in deaths from the delta variant of the virus would last up to six weeks. But there are signs in other areas that the surge is slowing down. According to health data, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 dropped to 839 Friday, the lowest total in a month. There were 238 people in hospital intensive care units, down from a record 296 on Sept. 29. And the 157 COVID-19 patients on ventilators was the lowest since Sept. 19. Active cases statewide have gone up slightly in the past few days after dipping to 11,331 on Tuesday, the lowest since late August. Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that improvement in the numbers “leads us to absolutely believe wholeheartedly that we have passed through the eye of the storm.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Federal prosecutors announced Friday that they won’t file charges against a white police officer who shot Jacob Blake last year – a shooting that sparked protests that led to the deaths of two men. Officer Rusten Sheskey shot Blake, who is Black, during a domestic disturbance in Kenosha in August 2020. The shooting left Blake paralyzed from the waist down and sparked several nights of protests, some of which turned violent. An Illinois man shot three people, killing two of them, during one of the demonstrations. State prosecutors decided not to file charges against Sheskey earlier this year after video showed that Blake, who was wanted on a felony warrant, was armed with a knife. The U.S. Department of Justice launched its own investigation days after the shooting. The agency announced Friday that a team of prosecutors from its Civil Rights Division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee reviewed police reports, witness statements, dispatch logs and videos of the incident and determined there wasn’t enough evidence to prove Sheskey willfully used excessive force or violated Blake’s federal rights. Blake’s uncle, Justin Blake, called the decision “unconscionable” and said it “definitely steps on every civil right we can imagine this country owes every African American descendant.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The intensive care unit in the state’s biggest hospital was at full capacity Friday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. While not all ICU patients were dealing with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus contributed to the strain, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/big12/2013/01/22/mens-college-basketball-oklahoma-state-marcus-smart-profile/1850729/", "title": "Smart went from 'dead or in jail' to Oklahoma State's selfless general", "text": "Eric Prisbell, USA TODAY Sports\n\nOklahoma State freshman point guard is a potential NBA lottery pick\n\nFamily tragedy sent him into a period of simmering rage and troublemaking as a youth\n\nCollege coaches praise Smart for his unselfish style of play and decisionmaking\n\nFLOWER MOUND, Texas -- Six years before Oklahoma State point guard Marcus Smart became one of the nation's most respected college basketball players, he threw rocks at people's heads.\n\nHow he blossomed into one of the sport's most humble stars, an unassuming 18-year-old potential NBA lottery pick, was through a journey defined by deep personal loss and self-discovery.\n\nRage burned inside him after seeing cancer overtake one older brother and cocaine nearly destroy another. Anger boiled while confronting a neighborhood south of Dallas he called a war zone amid duplexes. He desperately sought to inflict others with the pain that incessantly gnawed at his 12-year-old heart.\n\nOne night near his home in Lancaster began like so many others, with Marcus and a friend stuffing their pants pockets with rocks and positioning themselves on the second floor of the apartment complex they called The Pinks, looking for a target with a pulse. Little did Marcus know this would be such a pivotal night in his life.\n\nSpotting a man on a bike in a black hooded sweatshirt, they unleashed rocks and celebrated with high-fives and laughs after – Bam! – the pelting knocked the man to the ground. But when Marcus looked again, all he saw was the bike. And all he heard was the thumping of a man racing up the stairwell and a frenzied voice promising to kill him.\n\nMarcus and his friend leaped over the second-story railing, landing hard on the concrete below. The man quickly followed. Fueled by adrenaline and fear, Marcus sprinted faster than he ever had on the football field or basketball court, zigzagging through alleyways to an adjacent complex, The Meadows.\n\nBehind Marcus, the footsteps and menacing voice grew louder. Marcus did not know that the man was a member of the Bloods street gang. And until he glanced back in the dimly lit roads, he did not know what object the man held in his hand: a loaded gun.\n\nMarcus knew he no longer was the generous kid who as a 4-year-old gave a homeless man his coveted $20 bill, no longer the innocent child who pedaled his bike in cowboy boots to McDonald's for free burgers. He knew he had devolved into something else, a lost soul perhaps with just seconds left to breathe. His heart pounding and soaked in sweat, he breathed so uncontrollably he felt like his lungs were locked in a vise.\n\nThe man closed to within 15 yards. Marcus heard the ear-splitting sound of four gunshots.\n\n\"Ever see 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'?\" Marcus says now. \"Just imagine him that close to you with a chainsaw, that's how close he felt. All I kept thinking was, Am I going to die? Is this how I die? What is he going to do if he catches me but doesn't shoot me?\"\n\n***\n\nWhen fans see Marcus play college basketball now, racing up and down the court with an intensity few can rival, there is little evidence of that anger. Some players in the sport are more talented than Marcus, but few possess such a unique skill set, and even fewer are as reluctant to boast about it. To Marcus, his statistics are an afterthought; his teammates' statistics matter more. He deflects attention in an age when most crave it.\n\n\"It's his character,\" says Marcus' best friend and roommate Phil Forte, a friend of Marcus since they were in third grade. \"He plays with a chip on his shoulder, not like a prima donna.\"\n\nFran Fraschilla, the ESPN analyst and Dallas resident who has watched Marcus play since the ninth grade, says, \"It is very rare you see a young player with the countenance and knowledge of a 10-year NBA player … If you're going into an alley fight, and you have the Incredible Hulk on your side, you feel pretty good. That's what you have with him.\"\n\nSyracuse coach Jim Boeheim says that by season's end there may not be a more valuable player in the country. And Oklahoma State coach Travis Ford can recount myriad stories that he finds so unusual, so refreshing in this look-at-me-generation in which many players seek to compile highlight reels.\n\n\"For a McDonald's All-American, his approach to the game is like no one I have ever been around,\" Ford says. \"If you are around him for five minutes, you'd never guess that he is one of the best players in America.\"\n\nFew know how Marcus became the way he is today. Says Marcus, \"People always ask me, 'How are you so humble?' When you go through things like I have, there's only one way for you to be. Life is not a game. This is a cold world out there – the world is very cold – and if you don't learn things and understand things, this world can eat you up.\"\n\nFew know how his childhood fueled his competitiveness and shaped his self-effacing persona. Marcus says he shared his story with USA TODAY Sports, including many details that he never told close family members, so that other troubled children who have endured the loss of loved ones and hardscrabble environments have a template for success.\n\n\"I think about it every day, it's incredible,\" Marcus says. \"Thank God I had both parents and older brothers. My mom and brothers are my heroes … If I didn't change what I was doing, I would be dead or in jail.\"\n\nMarcus was bred in a close-knit family that rarely sulked despite tragedy. There was his mom, Camellia Smart, 58, who goes to dialysis three times a week and who has lived with one kidney since, she says, \"a kidney stone ate up the other one\" two decades ago. There's her husband of 38 years, Billy Frank Smart, the 66-year-old biological father of Marcus and Michael Smart. And there's Todd and Jeff Westbrook, who were born to a different father decades before Michael and Marcus were born.\n\nCamellia, whom the brothers deemed Wonder Woman for her fortitude and work ethic, was the family's heart. Todd, a second father figure to Michael and Marcus, was its backbone.\n\nMarcus knew that if anyone was destined to play in the NBA, it was Todd, who shot 62 percent from the field one season as a guard for Lancaster High. By the time Marcus would dribble a basketball all over the home in his boots, he had already heard all the stories from the 1980s that made him idolize Todd.\n\nMarcus knew that when doctors found a tumor behind Todd's eye at 15 years old, his mom felt like \"someone took a knife and split my chest in two.\" But he knew Todd barely flinched, telling the doctor, \"Okay, what do we do next?\"\n\nThough the cancer spread to his lungs, then his stomach, Todd always found enough resolve to mentor his brothers. He showed them how to shave, shake a man's hand and sell themselves in job interviews. He explained to Michael how to wear a condom. Even as he turned gaunt and too weak to walk to the bathroom without resting, he often called Michael and Marcus into his bedroom to watch the Discovery or History channels.\n\n\"That is what I always admire about him,\" Marcus says, \"that tenacity and that ambition to keep living even though you know you don't have much time.\"\n\nAs a 9-year-old, nothing meant more to Marcus than family. When Camellia saw he was wearing sneakers with holes in the bottom to school, Marcus shrugged. When a relative offered to buy him Nikes, he pointed to other $19 sneakers instead. And in December 2003, when Camellia asked him what he wanted for Christmas, Marcus said one word: \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Seriously, baby, what do you want?\" Camellia repeated.\n\n\"Momma, I don't want anything,\" Marcus answered. \"I ask God to bless me and my family to be together for Christmas.\"\n\nTogether with his family for the holidays, Marcus received that gift. But on Jan. 9, 2004, Marcus' aunt called him and his cousin inside from playing, asked them to sit down and tearfully delivered the news everyone feared: Todd was dying. The family was at the hospital. Marcus stared at her, gazing at her face, thinking he was dreaming.\n\nThen he sprung up and bolted out the door, slamming it so hard the glass shattered. His cousin chased him down, wrestling him to the ground while Marcus screamed. At the hospital, Marcus ran down a long hallway until he spotted the rest of his family, all bawling.\n\nTodd, at 33 years old and after an 18-year battle with cancer, had died.\n\nIn Todd's hospital room, among crying relatives still trying to speak to Todd, Marcus walked to the foot of the bed, slowly knelt and touched Todd's foot. \"It was cold as ice,\" he remembers. \"I have never felt something so cold and so hard in the human body before.\"\n\nCamellia, tears rushing down her face, picked Marcus up and told him everything would be okay. Still in disbelief, Marcus walked to the other side of the bed thinking Todd was merely sleeping. Marcus shook him and yelled, \"Todd, wake up!\"\n\nMarcus walked to the edge of the bed and placed a gentle kiss on Todd's lips. Marcus then put his hands in the air, saying, \"Todd is just like a butterfly. He flew away.\"\n\n***\n\nLosing Todd was a blow the family struggled to endure. In their home in DeSoto, Marcus and Michael, sometimes at the same time, could not help but crawl into Todd's bed at night, putting themselves to sleep to that familiar sound of the Discovery Channel. It was the same room where they would always put a hanger above the door in the shape of a basketball hoop and would join Todd in shooting balled up socks until Todd grew fatigued.\n\nNow without Todd, the brothers found a catharsis in surrounding themselves with Todd's memory, his images and sounds.\n\nBut Marcus also had other images seared into his mind: his 19-year-old brother Michael, who had been a talented point guard at Lancaster High, spiraling into a world of gangs, drugs and guns. Michael became affiliated with the Bloods street gang and acted as if he had a death wish.\n\nMichael saw friends accumulate up to $8,000 a week working the streets, driving Mercedes Benzes and '86 Chevys. They were decked out in gold and diamonds and had oversized flat-screen televisions before much of suburban American owned one.\n\nMarcus watched Michael springboard in that life and nearly drown. Michael says he made $2,500 per week, selling crack and other drugs and pimping out women. To protect himself, he says he had at least five firearms: \"A .40 and .45 caliber, a TEC-9, an AK-47 and a 12-gauge shotgun.\"\n\nAfter they moved to Lancaster, Marcus at times would run to the corner of the 1500 block of Bluegrove Road and make futile attempts to get Michael to come back home. Undeterred, Marcus would wait up until the wee hours of the morning to make sure Michael – though at times frazzled from drugs – returned home safe.\n\nMarcus, just 10 years old, would sit close to Michael in the near darkness of their home and tell him, \"Momma does not need a call at 2 a.m. telling her they found you in jail or six feet under. She already lost one son.\"\n\nMarcus would raise his little hand and wipe away tears from Michael's face.\n\n\"Stay out of trouble,\" Marcus told him. \"I promise, I got you, brother.\"\n\nLooking back eight years later, Marcus says, \"We had plenty of nights like that. I was growing up around it. I was seeing it. I was seeing his pain. I didn't like what he was doing, but he was still my brother and I loved him. You see that stuff on the news and play the [video] games, and it's like a video game. When you see it in front of you, it's terrifying.\"\n\nLess than a year after Todd's death, Marcus was at an AAU tournament when Camellia relayed him a message that Michael was in the hospital. During a one-month binge of cocaine abuse, Michael snorted so much on one occasion that he toppled over in the home and hurt his eye. Gary Westbrook, his uncle who was rendered a paraplegic after being shot in the spine in a carjacking, came off his wheelchair to pound his chest to try to revive him before calling 911.\n\nAnd soon after, Marcus again was in a long hospital hallway, bracing himself for another ice cold foot to grasp, thinking all the while that he could lose a second brother in the span of a year. Upon entering the room, his emotions swirled as he saw tubes coming out of Michael.\n\nMarcus gripped his hand.\n\n\"I do remember the look in Marcus' eyes,\" Michael says. \"And it was scary.\"\n\nSays Marcus, \"He should have been dead, that's how much was in his system.\"\n\nMichael remembers the doctor telling him, \"I'm here to save lives. If you want to do this to yourself, don't come here. Just kill yourself.\"\n\n***\n\nMichael recovered and went to the altar in church that Sunday. Though he was not done with street life, he says he never sniffed cocaine again. He vowed to keep Marcus away from that lifestyle. And he told gang members to leave Marcus alone or face Michael's wrath of bullets.\n\n\"You go down a different path,\" Michael told Marcus. \"It's called a straight arrow. People want to call you a punk or different? You be different. I promise you, six years later when you look back, see who is different and who made a difference.\"\n\nBut problems were beginning to fester for Marcus, whose rage simmered. As a young child, he hardly made a misstep, except when he says he foolishly smoked marijuana the only time in his life, when he was no older than 8. He says it made him so sick that he had to embarrassingly tell his mom, who took him to the emergency room. Camellia says Marcus only told her he was sick, not that he smoked pot.\n\nBut after losing Todd and nearly losing Michael, while surrounded by classmates flashing gang signs and guns on street corners, Marcus says, \"I just felt really lost. I definitely changed.\"\n\nHe and friends would steal candy, food and soda from stores. He uncorked much of his anger on the football field, but his greatest emotional release came from fighting. He called himself a bully, preying on the weak and strong.\n\n\"It feels like if you have a broken arm and you just want to scream,\" Marcus says of his anger. \"The worst pain you can ever think of, that's exactly how angry I felt. That's how bad the anger was and exactly how bad I wanted to release it. Got to release it. It's like a boiling pot. I didn't know how to express it beyond fighting.\"\n\nHe would get in three fights per week. He looked for any weapons he could find. He would throw knives and branches at people. He recalls nearly breaking a kid's neck. He says he felt like he could have killed someone.\n\nOn one occasion, he and a friend were jumped and outnumbered by guys. Marcus pulled out a pocketknife. They pulled out a pellet gun. Marcus went home and got his dad's .22 caliber pistol. Michael stopped him at the door before Marcus had the chance to hunt down the kids.\n\nThe fights escalated. He slammed another kid's head into the concrete. At one point, the principal called him into his office and told him he was to go to alternative school for 30 days.\n\n\"It was like jail,\" Marcus says. \"Good behavior and you can get out early.\"\n\nThe night that remains most crystallized in Marcus' mind is when he was running for his life from the man in the black hooded sweatshirt. He and his friend raced to a trail in the woods they knew well.\n\nThey made quick turns and knew a low-hanging branch required them to duck. The man did not duck, and they heard him get knocked to the ground. Once home that night, Marcus never closed his eyes.\n\n\"My life was almost taken,\" Marcus says. \"I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. From some stupid decision I decided to make, one stupid decision that I felt was good, that I felt was fun, it could have easily taken my life. That's a lesson learned.\n\n\"I really don't tell people that story because what would you say? What would you do if you were in that situation? It's just not a pretty sight to try to imagine running, literally running for your life.\"\n\nMarcus never told Michael that the man – an acquaintance of Michael -- shot at him, only that the man tried to beat him up. Marcus knew that if he had told Michael all the details, Michael might have killed the man.\n\n\"You see how he thinks?\" Michael says. \"If I just keep this to myself, my brother won't get in trouble and I just won't do it anymore. I would have gone out and somebody might have gotten killed. He came home safe. And I'm still here.\"\n\nAnd he never told his mother, but at the time she knew he needed help, an escape from that environment.\n\n\"I knew I had to do something,\" she says. \"You know how you know something is wrong, you can feel it. I've always told my boys, there's nothing too hard to come and talk to me about.\"\n\nOne day she sat Marcus down and talked. He told her about the fights. \"He was just tired almost of living. I said, 'Baby, why haven't you told me this before?' \" Camellia asked. \" 'Momma, I didn't want to worry you.' \"\n\n\"I didn't let the gangs rob my other boys, and I was not going to let them rob Marcus,\" she says. \"He was so depressed. You're battling out there. Peer pressure is a mother. 'Should I do this, do that? If I don't do this, I'm a coward.' He was too young to live through that.\"\n\nMarcus took anger management classes, which he says helped a great deal. And the family moved into a three-bedroom ranch house in Flower Mound, a suburb west of Dallas. Camellia relied on advice from the family of Phil Forte, Marcus' best friend who lived in Flower Mound, to select a school.\n\nMoving was a culture shock. Marcus would see people walking around outside at night and instinctively flinch. Friends would have to tell him that it was just a man walking his dog. Marcus now could sit on the family's back porch without hearing gunshots or fighting. The effect on Marcus was unmistakable.\n\n\"He was like reborn,\" Camellia says. \"How would you put it? Like he stepped out of the darkness to the light. That is how remarkable the change was.\"\n\nMarcus channeled his aggression in football and then in his primary sport, basketball. Teachers told Camellia how impressed they were that Marcus lacked a sense of entitlement that some other athletes possessed. When Marcus won trophies or awards, he would quickly put them aside and turn to YouTube to study intricate skills like Kobe Bryant's footwork. And when the recruiting letters came, he didn't dwell on them, instead hitting the gym with Michael.\n\n***\n\nSitting in an Applebee's last week, Michael's eyes welled up as he reflected on Marcus, a younger brother he says he looks up to as if he were an older brother. Michael says Marcus regularly encourages him to keep his life above board and tells him how proud he is that Michael, who is now 27 and works at a warehouse, gave up selling drugs a few years ago.\n\n\"God had me on this Earth for a reason,\" Michael says. \"And I think that might be the reason – my brother. He is doing something my mom wanted for all of us, to be successful. He is making us believe. You look at Marcus. Everything is complete. He has it all.\n\n\"When (Mom) looks at Marcus, it just brightens up her day. Todd is gone, but he's living in Marcus. It's crazy, man. You have met Todd because you met Marcus. Marcus seems like a big brother.\"\n\nBack in Camellia's suburban home, which is filled with Marcus' trophies, signed basketballs and Adidas shoes from the McDonald's All-American game, she walked to the fireplace and picked up a team picture of Todd from Lancaster's 1987-1988 season. Todd returned that senior season despite playing with little more than one eye and helped Lancaster to a No. 2 ranking in the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches' Class 4A poll.\n\nIn the picture, Todd wore No. 3, the same number each brother wore in high school. Each brother has a tattoo in memory of Todd. Marcus was also interested in wearing the No. 3 at Oklahoma State, but was told it was unavailable because Dan Lawson, who died in the Oklahoma State plane crash of 2001, had worn it. Marcus instead chose 33 because that was Todd's age when he died.\n\nIn Saturday's game against Texas Tech, Marcus scored only three points but didn't care. The team won. Marcus reflects on his life every day, appreciative of how far he has come and determined to always play hard and unselfishly. He is intent not to let his brother's name go in vain.\n\nHe says he has firm control now over his emotions, and his coach, Travis Ford, calls him one of the most genuine players he has been around.\n\n\"I don't want to be that person they look at and say, 'He's an A-hole, he's mean,'\" Marcus says. \"I want them to look at Marcus Smart and say he's the nicest guy I have ever met. I want to hear good things. I don't want to hear any negative things about me. It makes me look bad. It makes me feel bad. It makes my family look bad. I'm a reflection of my mom, my brothers and everyone in my family. How I carry myself is a reflection of how they raised me. I've learned that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2024/04/25/nfl-draft-2024-in-detroit-updates/73430278007/", "title": "'Insanity': Attendance record set, maximum capacity reached at NFL ...", "text": "At long last, the 2024 NFL draft is here. Hundreds of thousands of football fans descended upon downtown Detroit for the sports spectacle that will see more than 200 new players enter the league and hope at an all-time high for all 32 teams, including the Detroit Lions.\n\nWhile the actual NFL draft began at 8 tonight with Round 1, the NFL Fan Experience opened to the public at noon. We're covering all the action as we bring the excitement to you with live updates and visuals from Detroit.\n\nKeep up with our live updates on what's happening on Day 1 at the NFL draft's theater near Campus Martius and at the NFL Fan Experience in Hart Plaza.\n\nThat's all for tonight, folks\n\nSee ya tomorrow!\n\n—Matthew Dolan and Eric D. Lawrence\n\nLions draft choice wows crowd on record-setting night\n\nAs Mark Elker watched the 2024 NFL draft inch closer to the Detroit Lions' pick, he couldn't help but hope.\n\nAfter hours standing outside downtown amidst the festivities at Campus Martius, he also couldn't hold it any longer.\n\nIt was just as he left the bathroom that he learned the Lions traded up from the 29th pick to the 24th pick. Suddenly, three hours after the draft started, his team was on the clock. He also knew his guy, Alabama cornerback Terrion Arnold, remained on the board.\n\nSo he did what any dedicated fan would do: the 62-year-old from Northville ran.\n\nHe couldn't run too fast: It was dark, cold, and the massive Honolulu Blue firefighters helmet he wore was less than aerodynamic. Yet he made it back to the plaza in time to hear Commissioner Rodger Goodell announce the Lions picked what some believe could be the missing piece to a Super Bowl roster.\n\n\"He's the guy I was hoping for. I kept thinking -- he's dropping, make a move, make a move,\" Elker said minutes after the pick.\n\nHis son, Jacob Elker, was equally excited about the pick. The Lions helmet atop his own head bobbled up and down as he elaborated on why it was an obvious pick for the pride.\n\nLike the others around him standing near the draft stage, he said he felt the electricity surge as people realized Detroit traded up.\n\n\"I was closer (to the stage) in the crowd, and as soon as the logo came up, we were like, 'Oh no, oh god!' We knew magic was gonna happen,\" said Elker, 32.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nFan says pick means big things ahead\n\nJake Shamoon of Sterling Heights says Detroit's pick is the best.\n\nHe also knows what's next for the Lions, apparently the Super Bowl.\n\n—Darcie Moran\n\nFather and son at odds, but that's OK\n\nSam Herron, 10, of the Flint area, was at odds with his dad on the first draft night.\n\nStill wearing a J.J. McCarthy No. 9 Michigan jersey, he said he was happy the quarterback didn’t end up in the AFC West.\n\nHerron is a Kansas City Chiefs fan, specifically a fan of quarterback Patrick Mahomes. With McCarthy headed to a different division with the Minnesota Vikings, Herron said he can still root for him.\n\nHis dad, 45-year-old Dan Herron, felt a little differently. As a Lions fan, he’d hoped McCarthy wouldn’t land in the NFC North.\n\n“It would be easier to root for him,” he said.\n\nThe duo did agree the Detroit draft experience had been a good one, however.\n\nThey got downtown about 6 p.m. and though crowded, the lines moved pretty well, the elder Herron said.\n\nThe younger Herron’s favorite part of the day was a Little Caesar’s Pizza draft activity where he got to throw footballs and eat their namesake product.\n\nThe elder Herron said his son has been getting more into football in recent years and the younger was glad for the chance to go to the draft.\n\n“This is in our home state,” Sam said.\n\n—Darcie Moran\n\nLions make their pick\n\nThe crowd erupted late Thursday when the Detroit Lions' draft pick was announced. They traded up five spots for Alabama cornerback Terrion Arnold.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nSecretary of State Benson weighs in on the scene\n\nRoot against J.J.?\n\nDee Handy of Detroit watched the NFL draft at the Lloyd Diehl Boys and Girls club in Detroit during a watch party after the a conference on youth sports.\n\nShe waited to see where former Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy would land.\n\n“I would always want him to come back,” she said.\n\nMoments later, the Minnesota Vikings selected McCarthy with the 10th pick in the draft.\n\n“I don’t know how to feel about that!,” she said in shock. “That’s one of our biggest rivals.”\n\nAs it all settled in that the former star quarterback in Ann Arbor would be playing for a division rival of the Detroit Lions, Handy, who works at a Boys and Girls Club in Van Buren Township, had only one thing to say:\n\n“We’re going to have to smack you around, J.J.”\n\n—Eric Guzmán\n\nDetroit police chief weighs in on crowds, security\n\nIt’s a lot of people, said Detroit Police Chief James White said with a laugh after replacing his cap following The Star-Spangled Banner playing before a crowd of thousands at the NFL draft in downtown Detroit Thursday night. But, he said, “everything is going as expected” and “everybody’s pretty much well-behaved.”\n\nA little bit of a challenge has been people indulging in adult beverages, White said.\n\nIt’s not like any other sports game or Lions game when people tailgate starting at 6 or 8 a.m. in the morning and leave by 4 p.m., he said. People have been out all day and the draft likely won’t clear out until midnight, he said. He encouraged people to pace themselves.\n\nThere were also some people who also tried to sneak in when the entryways closed, White confirmed.\n\n“We were right on top of it and were able to get them out and it was no big deal, nobody got arrested or anything,” he said.\n\nWhite commended his officers – he’d smiled for photos with a few members of the law enforcement community at the back of the crowd - and he said the security measures were going well.\n\n“Just be patient,” was his message to fans. “It’s going to be a long evening with the draft picks and pace yourself with the drinking and we’re going to get you out of here safely with our traffic plan.”\n\n—Darcie Moran\n\nJJ heads north to join Vikings\n\nMichigan fans watching the NFL Draft in Detroit offered mixed feelings about watching beloved quarterback JJ McCarthy go to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nA Vikings fan stopped Julian Medina,15, so he could get a picture with his McCarthy jersey. Medina, of Laingsburg, located just northeast of Lansing, said McCarthy is primed to perform well.\n\n\"He's got weapons, like Justin Jefferson,\" he said.\n\nThat's the problem, said Matt Laun, a 36 year old Michigan and Lions fan.\n\n\"It's gonna suck,\" he said, moments after cheering for McCarthy. \"It's gonna suck to root against him.\"\n\nAlthough gear for the Lions and other NFL franchises made up the majority of swag at the draft, quite a few people wore their Michigan jerseys and other Maize and Blue garb.\n\nWill McDowell, 35, of Detroit brought his makeshift championship belt to the draft. Before the draft he said he wants McCarthy to succeed, but really didn't want him in the NFC North.\n\n\"I'm gonna be bummed when I see Aidan Hutchinson hit him at least twice a year,\" he said, before the Vikings took McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy, 21, led the Wolverines to a 15-0 record and a National Championship this season. However, the fact he threw relatively few passes compared with other top quarterback prospects left him as something of an unknown to some scouts and teams.\n\nHe’s the first Michigan quarterback taken in the opening round of the draft since Jim Harbaugh went to the Bears in 1987. There was some speculation that Harbaugh, McCarthy’s coach while at Michigan and current leader of the LA Chargers, might trade away star Justin Herbert to land his former protege.\n\nBut in the end, it was not meant to be.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nKeep calm and watch on\n\nDressed in a custom ice blue tux —his nickname is Frozone, after the “Incredibles” character — Mike Sainristil spent Thursday night in Ann Arbor, waiting to be drafted by the NFL. He was surrounded by family and friends, including neighbors from his hometown, Everett, Mass. Sainristil, a University of Michigan defensive back, said he wasn’t nervous. True to his suit, true to his nickname, he was calm and cool. “I feel good,” he said\n\nAlso: At the party, the room cheered when JJ McCarthy was drafted.\n\n—Georgea Kovanis\n\nFirst day draws record attendance\n\nWe expected the numbers to be big, but they really were huge.\n\nThe first day of the NFL draft in Detroit drew massive attendance, according to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nSpeaking from the draft stage Thursday night, Goodell said it was a draft record with more than 270,000 people.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nNew to Detroit and confused by this word phrase around the draft scene? We've got you.\n\nForm: Sometimes it's \"Whatupdoe!\" — all one word; But it can also be \"What up doe,\" written in three words, also is commonly used and is acceptable. While often followed with an exclamation point, such punctuation is not always necessary; it just depends on context and how it is used by the subject.\n\nUsage: Similar to the Hawaiian \"Aloha,\" \"Whatupdoe!\" can mean hello or goodbye. \"Doe\" is a contraction of the word \"though,\" and does not represent an actual person or a female hoofed ruminant ungulate of the Cervidae family (a female deer).\n\nAlternate meanings: What are you doing? What do you want to do (casually/collegially, or in response to another's use of fighting words, i.e: \"I'll whoop yo' a--! response); \"Whatupdoe?! Note the change in punctuation, with an addition of a question mark followed by the exclamation point for emphasis. This iteration is typically used with the physical gesture of hands raised or outstretched, signaling it's about to go down/the proverbial poop is about to hit the fan.\n\n—James Hill\n\nFireworks and a flyover spark chant\n\nDetroit mayor warned of capacity issues before draft\n\nMayor Mike Duggan had warned visitors last month to plan their NFL draft trip and arrive early because the downtown footprint would fill up, though he touted other remote options nearby. The fenced area in downtown Detroit filled around the time of rapper Big Sean's performance and hundreds of visitors awaiting entry were turned away before 6:30 p.m.\n\nDuggan said in March: “I want people to start thinking about this and their experience. If you were at the draft in Las Vegas or Kansas City, everybody was inside the NFL fence. You swiped in and they accommodated everyone.\n\n\"Here, our fenced area is in downtown, it's not going to be as big. I'm guessing one in three or one in four people who are down here are actually going to be inside the NFL fenced zone.\"\n\nDuggan could not be immediately reached Thursday.\n\nThe mayor, among draft planning officials from Visit Detroit and the Detroit Sports Commission, said that while visitors may technically be outside of the NFL OnePass zone, there are options outside the footprint in Capitol Park, Beacon Park, Grand Circus Park, Harmonie Park, Corktown and along Woodward Avenue to watch and participate in NFL draft activities.\n\n\"What the team here has done has created so many other spaces where you're going to be able to watch and hear the draft,\" Duggan said at the time.\n\n—Dana Afana\n\nCheck out Big Sean's set here\n\nBig Sean was in his element Thursday night, whipping up a festive hometown performance to kick off NFL draft festivities in downtown Detroit.\n\nLooking out over a sea of Detroit Lions’ Honolulu blue peppered with pockets of team colors from teams across the NFL’s other 31 markets, the homegrown rapper performed a half-hour set traversing his career catalog. It was part of an NFL draft that promised to lean hard into Detroit's rich musical legacy — including an ESPN broadcast that launched Thursday night with a Smokey Robinson voiceover and Motown's \"Get Ready.\"\n\nWith thousands packing the area around the hangar-sized bandshell at Cadillac Square, awaiting the 8 p.m. draft start, the atmosphere had the sizzling noise and anticipation of a big music festival. It was a brisk but sunny evening as Detroit stepped onto center stage of the sports world.\n\nBig Sean donned a bandana and Aidan Hutchinson Lions jersey for the occasion, acknowledging other fan bases on hand (“I see the Vikings, I see the Ravens, I see the Bears”) but drawing a roar when he shouted out the Lions and coach Dan Campbell for their hot 2023-24 season.\n\n“You gotta respect that,” Big Sean said, later vowing the team is ultimately Super Bowl-bound: “The Lions are going to get their shot — I can feel it.”\n\n—Brian McCollum\n\nBoxed out of the main event, these fans went high\n\nA gaggle of football fans gathered on the roof of the garage near the corner of Griswold and Lafayette in downtown Detroit to try to steal a view into the NFL main stage after officials barred the gates, citing full capacity.\n\n—Matthew Dolan\n\nAn electric opening to the draft with a hometown guest\n\nThe Detroit Lions introduced the world to the city with a warm welcome to kick off the NFL draft.\n\nCurrent players and past legends joined NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and Detroit icon Eminem on the draft stage in the heart of Campus Martius Park to start the 2024 NFL draft. Jared Goff, freshly-extended Amon-Ra St. Brown, Aidan Hutchinson, Calvin Johnson and Barry Sanders walked out onto the stage with a dramatic entrance.\n\nGoodell came out first to a wave of boos, as is custom, then it turned into a raucous cheer when Eminem came out.\n\nThen, the Lions legends graced the stage, and the crowd went crazy.\n\nSt. Brown, now $120 million richer, was the first player to greet the crowd. He welcomed the massive crowd in attendance and then started a chant for his quarterback standing behind him.\n\n\"Before we get off the stage, I need to hear one thing, JA-RED GOFF, JA-RED GOFF,\" St. Brown said, before trailing off and letting the strong Honolulu blue contingent in attendance take it from there.\n\n—Jared Ramsey\n\nSurgery is no barrier for devoted fan\n\nAs a lifelong Lions fan who has been through the team's hardships and reveled in their successful last season, Ben Seifert, 24, of Troy couldn’t miss the draft in Detroit. Even if a basketball game gone wrong did just earn him reconstructive surgery on his foot. It involved multiple screws and plates.\n\nSporting a Sanders jersey and knee scooter, he rolled up to the theater as presenters took the stage.\n\nHe got to Hart Plaza about 3:30 p.m. and used the handicap entrance without issue to get through. He had to navigate getting over some curbs, but he’s an athletic guy, and everyone had been pretty courteous, he said.\n\nHe wanted to come out for the atmosphere and to see the young players.\n\n“Broken foot’s not going to stop me,” he said.\n\n—Darcie Moran\n\nCheck out all of the NFL draft looks here\n\nDesigner tennis shoes, grills and, of course, Cartier buffs all made an appearance on the NFL draft red carpet Thursday but many of the prospects chose to use the red carpet as an opportunity to honor their families and communities.\n\nAbout a dozen of the top NFL draft prospects walked the red carpet at the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit in suits widely ranging in colors, from salmon to pastel green, before the first round of the draft later in the evening.\n\nTerrion Arnold had two photos on the inside of his suit: one of the first time he started playing football and another of his family with him for signing day.\n\n—Adrienne Roberts\n\nShowing off the fit on the red carpet\n\nQueuing up for the QLINE\n\n'The scene in Detroit is insanity'\n\nNFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport chimed in on how this NFL draft experience in Detroit compares to other recent drafts.\n\nBarry Sanders has arrived\n\nSticker-shock for excited fans\n\nZach Lorenc, 18, and his dad Shae Lorenc, 51, said they waited about an hour to buy some tacos. It was roughly $35 for 5 quesadillas and two drinks.\n\n“It was the only food we could get,” Zach said.\n\nStill, the pair from Novi said they expected big crowds and were just excited to experience the draft in person.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nApp tells fans: We're at max capacity, try tomorrow\n\nThe NFL draft application for mobile phones told fans around 6:45 that the main zone of the festivities is at capacity and won't re-open today (there are remote sites outside the gates for viewing parties). The app instructed fans that draft Day 2 open at noon tomorrow.\n\n—Christina Hall\n\nBig time for Big Sean\n\nTens of thousands of fans screamed back lyrics to Big Sean as he performed at the NFL draft two hours before the start of the event. The crowds were so thick that the NFL draft paused general admission at about 6:30, turning away hundreds from the gates.\n\nBig Sean noted he attended high school at Cass Tech, just around the corner from a stage now at the heart of the NFL universe.\n\nWearing a black Aidan Hutchinson jersey, he told the crowd to follow their dreams and to expect another big season from the Detroit Lions.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\nFull capacity for General Admission\n\nAt 6:30 p.m., the NFL draft announced a pause in general admission entry. \"Please visit Grand Circus Park or otherd Day in the D viewing parties.\"\n\n—Matthew Dolan\n\nKids on the Corner\n\nOn a sunny Thursday afternoon, parents and children from across the region lined up at the Corner Ballpark, which is a hub for youth activities during the draft.\n\nThursday, Friday and Saturday, the Corner will host football clinics and watch parties for kids and families.\n\nThe Corner, home to Detroit PAL, sits at what's considered hallowed sports grounds of Michigan Avenue and Trumbull, where Tiger Stadium stood.\n\n“Thrilled is the word that comes to mind for the city of Detroit. It’s really special,\" said Fred Hunter, CEO of Detroit PAL on Thursday. As PAL celebrates its 55th season, Hunter is hopeful that the city will leave a great impression on fans.\n\n“I want people to come out and enjoy this unique opportunity we have.”\n\nThe Corner's will host on-field football clinics for children ages 6 to 14, other activities for kids including an obstacle course and Hail Mary pass attraction, as well as food trucks Thursday through 8 p.m., Friday 3:30 p.m.- 8 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m.- 5:30 p.m. As teams make their picks in the draft, the Corner will host watch parties. Participation is first-come first-serve and registration on the NFL's One Pass app is required, according to the NFL draft's website\n\n—Eric Guzmán\n\nLots of people and the city looks great!\n\nEntry 2 is closed\n\nThe NFL draft says Entry 2 is now closed because of crowd capacity. Plan to use Entry 1 (Jefferson and Randolph) or Entry 3 (Cadillac Square) instead.\n\n—Eric D. Lawrence\n\nTime to roll out the...\n\nAs the crowds swarm below, advertising takes to the skies\n\nThe zone around the draft Thursday afternoon was treated to an aerial parade of by-planes pulling advertisements in a giant circle above the crowds. Many were for marijuana sales. They were joined by the thrump-thrumping of hovering helicopters, making the skies above downtown Detroit filled with its own kind of traffic jam.\n\n—Matthew Dolan\n\nBeware: This gate into the draft zone is very crowded\n\nThe NFL draft cautioned around 5:15 p.m. that its Entry 2 on Griswold Street \" is exceptionally congested and causing delays.\" You've been warned!\n\n—Brian Manzullo\n\nCrowds swell downtown streets as draft approaches\n\nDowntown Detroit grew increasingly crowded through the afternoon.\n\nAs 5 p.m. approached, People Mover cars were packed with visitors and nearly at full capacity.\n\nDown on Woodward Avenue, the line to see Detroit retired Lions running back Billy Sims stretched for half a block.\n\nRomney Funderburg, 25, of Romulus, said the hour-wait for Sims’ autograph was worth it, and he plans to give the inscribed photo to his father, a retired firefighter who is a big Billy Sims fan.\n\n“When I first got a No. 20 jersey, he asked me, ‘Do you know who wore 20?’ And I’m like, 'Yeah, Barry Sanders.' He’s like ‘But do you know who wore 20 before Barry Sanders?’ And he told me, 'Billy Sims,'” he said.\n\n“As soon as I saw that he was here, I had to go get something for my dad,” he explained.\n\nFunderburg also said he was surprised by the size of the crowds in downtown.\n\n“I’m not used to seeing this many people,” he said. “And it’s not just people form Detroit, it’s people from all of the country. One of my friends is working the draft and he told me expect at least 300,000 people here.”\n\n—JC Reindl\n\nWhen in doubt, think hoofing it or ride-sharing\n\nIf you’re avoiding the perils of driving downtown during the draft — good call!\n\nBetween traffic, limited parking, street closures, or, maybe, you plan to do a little responsible celebratory day-drinking, navigating the draft by foot or a ride-share service might be most convenient.\n\nIf traveling by taxi or through a ride-sharing service, there are designated pickup locations throughout downtown Detroit. Pay close attention to the streets listed in your app for the pickup area nearest to you, or visit nfl.com for a full list of pickup and drop-off locations.\n\nYou’ll also want to build in some time to walk to your pickup location before confirming your car to avoid missing your driver and risking a no-show fee.\n\n—Lyndsay C. Green\n\nIs it Gov. Tirico?\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, posing as a sportscaster in a video posted Thursday on X, filmed video of her asking more than a half-dozen people Wednesday at Gilly's in Detroit \"the question that is on everyone's mind: Who are the Lions playing in Super Bowl 59?\"\n\nThe answers ranged from the Kansas City Chiefs, who won the Super Bowl the last two years, to the Baltimore Ravens to the Buffalo Bills. NBC Sports broadcaster Mike Tirico, who lives in Ann Arbor, picked Kansas City.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan had a \"bigger question\" on his mind.\n\n\"You know, right now, my bigger question, they're letting me announce the fifth round pick, so I'm trying to figure out who they're gonna pick in the fifth round,\" he said as he spoke into a tiny microphone Whitmer held. \"And then, we'll go deal with the (Miami) Dolphins later.\"\n\n\"The Dolphins. Alright, you heard that,\" Whitmer said.\n\nWhitmer, who studied communications as an undergraduate at Michigan State University, wanted to pursue a career in sports broadcasting before she found her passion in politics.\n\nTirico told Whitmer: \"I wanna be the governor 'cause I was a political science major. So do you wanna job swap?\"\n\n\"We're gonna job swap,\" Whitmer said.\n\n\"Here we go. Bye,\" Tirico said with a laugh at the end of the nearly two-minute video.\n\n-Christina Hall\n\n$100 downtown parking\n\nYou can drive downtown in the Motor City for the NFL draft, but it’ll cost you. Downtown lots and garages charged $50 or more.\n\nOne lot on Fort Street posted a sign noting a $60 charge was nearly full.\n\nAbigail Blumberg was on her way to work at Parc complaining about the surge in parking costs. She usually parks downtown and it typically costs her $12. But today she was flabbergasted by what she saw with parking costs ranging up to $100.\n\n“That’s absolutely crazy,” she said. Fortunately for her, her workplace covered the cost of the parking Thursday.\n\nBut Blumberg said she hopes workers who didn’t have the benefit of their parking being paid didn’t have to bear the entire cost themselves.\n\n“I really hope that they carpooled and split the cost with somebody else,” she said.\n\nAnd for those taking public transportation to get downtown some had to do a bit of walking. The Qline southbound stops at Little Caesars Arena during the draft. And bus riders saw their typical commutes rerouted around downtown due to road closures related to the draft.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nDetroit Ambassadog draws fans\n\nWhile thousands of fans pour through downtown Detroit as the NFL draft consumes the city, Tom McDevitt’s dog Bobby, both of whom live in downtown Detroit, caught the eyes of fans who surrounded the furry fellow. Bobby is known as “Detroit Ambassadog” on Instagram, and McDevitt’s goal is to highlight the city and pit bulls with Bobby.\n\n“We make fun little social videos,” McDevitt said. “We go to all the tailgates, so he's kind of known around the Lions circle of fandom of sorts. We've traveled cross country to support the team and went to San Francisco for the NFC Championship game and met some fans out there. It was fun … he's just enjoying himself. He loves he's a people person and loves getting butt scratches is his favorite thing.”\n\nBobby snatched the attention of visitors while wearing a fuzzy lions mane around his neck to show his Detroit Lions spirit, allowing visitors surround him with pets and plenty of love.\n\n“He’s a good sport. He wears that he wears work goggles and a hat every once in a while,” McDevitt said, who’s been a Lions fan for years, including their roughest periods.\n\n“I've never thought this day would come when we would actually be good. And now we have like the highest-paid players in the NFL, that's another mind-blowing thing to think about. But I'm so excited for this upcoming season and for all the smiles that (Bobby) can put on people's faces during the during the tailgate,” McDevitt said.\n\n-Dana Afana\n\nLast-minute tips\n\nDo not purchase drinks prior to entering gates. It's like the airport and you'll have to leave them at the gate.\n\nHuntington Place has parking on the rooftop for $20.\n\nDrink prices: Bud Light and Michelob Ultra, $15. Water, $6. Bud Light Seltzer, Crown Royal Whisky Lemonade and Smirnoff Smash Vodka Soda, $16.\n\nThere's a hydration station with water for refilling bottles inside the draft footprint at Michigan Avenue and Campus Martius.\n\nFans attending the NFL draft experience with mobility disabilities can access wheelchairs at the Accessibility Center/Fan Services Center. The center is located on the lefthand side of the entrance to the draft events at Hart Plaza on the south end of Griswold.\n\n-Brendel Hightower, Jalen Williams\n\nDraft fans spill into Capitol Park\n\nFans enjoyed sun, new football-shaped chairs, good food and local vendors at \"Draft Day in the D\" at Capitol Park.\n\nA line of mostly Lions fans and one lone Bengals fan waited for loaded mac and cheese and pulled pork from the Slows Bar B Q food truck.\n\nThe Rolling Stoves food truck hyped a smashed cheeseburger and vegan chipotle black bean burger. Detroit Girls Rock is selling T-shirts and varsity jackets. Draft Day in the D is put on by the Downtown Detroit Partnership.\n\n-Anjanette Delgado\n\n40-yard speed racers have a good time\n\nElite NFL prospects can run 40 yards in just over 4 seconds.\n\nJames Zagunis, 7, of Allen Park managed his in about 8 seconds. It wasn't quite enough to beat his friend Theo Gallmeyer, 9, but that doesn't mean James didn't give it his all: He started running a hair early and managed to throw an impressive hip check against a racing Theo, much to the chagrin and approval of the crowd.\n\n\"I just dig racing,\" James said, polarized sunglasses on his forehead and a Jahmyr Gibbs jersey on his back.\n\n\"He pushed me!\" Theo said, adding he wanted to race to prove he could beat James.\n\nJames, Theo and a cadre of others were some of the hundreds of people who participated in the 40-yard-dash, one of the most popular events within the NFL Draft Experience at Hart Plaza. Fans waited for well over 30 minutes for their chance to sprint down and turf and dive into the mats underneath a scoreboard that displayed their times.\n\nIt's all part of experience that they just couldn't miss, said James' dad, Jimmy.\n\n\"I think it gives us obviously an opportunity to show what we have as a city, and all the fans and the great people that we have,\" Jimmy said. \"It's good to see fans from all over the world, in Detroit.\"\n\nA Michigan Man, Theo wants the Lions to take either ex-Wolverine running back Blake Corum or quarterback J.J. McCarthy. James said it didn't matter, as long as they're talented.\n\n\"As long as my team is good!\" James said.\n\n-Dave Boucher\n\nLions fans feel the beat\n\nFans encircled the Lions Honolulu Boom drumline before the team marched its way west down Jefferson Avenue.\n\n“Best drumline in the league,” someone shouted from the crowd. They brought the volume up a few notches and then had Lions fans join them to cheer on the Detroit team.\n\n“Let’s go Lions!” fans screamed as they grooved and took out their phones to capture the electric moment. Spontaneous chants have broken out all afternoon. Earlier in the day fans screamed out “Jar-ed Goff” in unison in tribute to the Lions quarterback.\n\n'Happy people, welcoming people. That's what we do in Detroit.'\n\nThe first pick in the 2024 NFL draft wouldn't come for several hours, but you wouldn't know it by the tens of thousands of people milling around downtown Detroit early Thursday afternoon.\n\nFootball fans waited in long lines to get inside the in-depth NFL Draft Experience tent, to get pizza or to throw footballs to huge cutouts of Aidan Hutchinson and other Lions greats.\n\nOthers took their pictures with huge helmets of their favorite teams — and in the case of a couple Green Bay Packers fans, to boo next to the helmet of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt all boils down to a perfect day for Detroit, said Reiner Calderero, 47, and Chris Guiao, 41.\n\n\"This doesn't happen often, especially in the city of Detroit. We haven't had a big event since the Super Bowl like 18 years ago,\" said Guiao, of Sterling Heights. \"We just love all the fans coming in from everywhere.\"\n\nEven among the Lions-heavy crowd, the duo stood out. Dressed head to toe in Detroit garb, their Luchidore masks went above and beyond the jerseys or hats adorning most fans.\n\nThey're not johnny-come-lately fans, they said — although they're welcoming the bandwagon jumpers following the Lions historic playoff run. They've stood by the team through thick and thin, and now, just want to bask in a wonderful moment for the franchise and metro Detroit.\n\n\"The people coming in here from all around the world coming in here, they're seeing peaceful people. Happy people, welcoming people. That's what we do in Detroit. We're not like them other cities,\" said Caldereo, of Warren. \"Proud of Detroit.\"\n\nGuiao agreed.\n\n\"It's that cliche: Midwestern hospitality. Everyone's nice. We just want to show everyone that this city is a legitimate city to come visit, come be at, enjoy, have the energy,\" he said.\n\n-Dave Boucher\n\nA sunny, family-friendly draft day\n\nParents brought their children out for the NFL draft in Detroit in hopes of cultivating the next generation of fans.\n\nSaliha Elmore, 35, of Detroit walked her 1-year-old son in a stroller on a chilly but sunny spring day in Detroit. “I heard that this was the first draft here, so I wanted to just bring him out, enjoy the weather and just experience this, and that way he can at least say that he’s been to a draft before,” she said.\n\nWhile she roots for the Lions, she says that she’s not a diehard fan, noting that she’s not from Michigan originally. But she hopes her son grows up to root for the Detroit football team and hopes it will make him more connected to the city where he’s from.\n\nShe appreciated how family-friendly the event at Hart Plaza was and noted how many kids she’s seen. She said she appreciated the tent for nursing mothers. “You don’t see a lot of nursing stations at a lot of places,” she said.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nA working fountain in Hart Plaza and $51 T-shirts\n\nBy midday, thousands of visitors had entered the draft zone and were hanging out around Hart Plaza. The crowd was primarily male and the most common attire was a Detroit Lions jersey.\n\nThe city’s Dodge Fountain, broken for years but now newly repaired, was on and running.\n\n“It beautiful,” said Randy Nelson, 57, of Flushing. “I've never seen it happen.”\n\nOne of the longer lines in the early afternoon was for a pop-up store selling official NFL draft merchandise, including adjustable ballcaps and novelty T-shirts priced up to $51.\n\nJohn Cadwell, of New Hudson, had a friend in the line buy him one of the official Detroit NFL draft caps.\n\n“Only reason I got one is I don’t think it’s going to come back to Detroit anytime soon,” Cadwell said, adding, “I’m the outcast wearing 49ers gear here, but having a good time!”\n\nThe afternoon was also an unofficial reintroduction of sorts for Bud Light — an official draft sponsor — and the male football fan demographic, in the wake of last year’s controversy and consumer boycott following the beer brand’s tie-in with a trans social media star.\n\nThere were crowds of men all over Hart Plaza with Bud Light cans in hand.\n\n“This is what the beer vendor had most of,” explained Brad Jennings, 32, of Livonia.\n\n-JC Reindl\n\nGet a pep talk from Detroit's favorite coach\n\nWant Lions coach Dan Campbell to predict your future? Stop by Hart Plaza, inside a a replica of Ford Field at the NFL Draft Experience. Wearing a black Lions long-sleeved T-shirt and hat, a mechanical Campbell greeted fans Thursday.\n\n\"Welcome to Detroit, draft patron. Have a great time. No seriously, welcome. OK, you can go now,\" he says in one response. \"You've been bruised. I can sit up here and give you coach speak all day long. None of that matters, and you don't want to hear it anyway. You've had enough of that, so take your fortune and get out of here.\"\n\nThe fortune teller game produced small \"Grit and Glory Fortunes\" cards bearing a photo of Campbell with different messages. One reads: \"When we hit hard times, we keep pushing forward. We know what that's about, nobody handles that stuff like we do.\" Another reads, \"The future waits for no one. But if it's looking for us it won't have to look far because we'll be on its front porch kicking the door down.\"\n\nLongtime Lions fan and native Detroiter Felicia Hodges, 47, said she heard about the Campbell fortune teller as she stood waiting in line to take a photo with the Lions' helmet near Hart Plaza. She can't know for certain what the future holds for her team, but she sees good things coming for the upcoming season.\n\n\"I am so excited. I'm very happy, because they've come a long long way. But we're going to get there eventually to that Super Bowl,\" she said. Over the past 20 years, she's seen the team through good and bad. \"When you're a diehard fan, it's win, lose or draw. Whatever. I never waver one moment ever for all these years,\" Hodges said.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nNoon: Fans encounter team gear, barricades as draft opens\n\nAs the NFL draft kicked off in Detroit, football fans from around the world descended on downtown donning their teams’ jerseys. But most found themselves in a sea of Honolulu blue as Detroit Lions fans new and old gathered for the massive sports event to see their teams’ picks.\n\nA heavy security presence dotted the perimeter of the fenced-off area surrounding Hart Plaza and the larger draft area as fans began lining up down Griswold Street early to enter the main gate for the NFL Draft Experience.\n\nCars heading down Fort Street toward Woodward encountered metal gates, forcing them to turn around and find a different route. During the draft’s takeover, downtown workers have had to alter their commutes and found their usual parking spots blocked off.\n\nInside the area around Hart Plaza fans took photos next to their teams’ helmets. The line for the Lions’ helmet was the longest. They stood below the Joe Louis fist facing the Detroit River, their faces beaming. Some grabbed a bite to eat a local vendors.\n\nFor those needing a break, the area included designated prayer and sensory rooms.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nCelebrate the Lions' epic season withthe Detroit Free Press' new commemorative book: “From Grit to Glory: The Epic Story of the Detroit Lions’ 2023 Renaissance.\" Order now atLions.PictorialBook.com!\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press on Instagram (@detroitfreepress), TikTok (@detroitfreepress), YouTube (@DetroitFreePress), Twitter/X (@freep), and LinkedIn, and like us on Facebook (@detroitfreepress).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2024/02/08/women-raped-bahamas-amber-shearer-dongayla-dobson/72524985007/", "title": "2 Kentucky women say they were drugged, raped by Bahamas ...", "text": "Police in the Bahamas this week arrested two people on sexual assault charges after two American women on a Carnival cruise said they were drugged and raped while in the country.\n\nThe report comes on the heels of the United States Department of State issuing a travel advisory for the Bahamas − a popular for cruises and spring break vacations.\n\nA \"quick response\" by officers in Grand Bahama, the northernmost island of the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean, resulted in the arrest of a 54-year-old man of Eight Mile Rock and a 40-year-old man of South Bahamia after they allegedly sexually assaulted two women on Sunday, the Royal Bahamas Police Force reported.\n\nAccording to a preliminary report from the department, the attacks took place shortly after noon on Sunday while two females visited a beach in Central Grand Bahama.\n\nThe women, two mothers from Kentucky who identified themselves as Amber Shearer and Dongayla Dobson, told News Nation's Chris Cuomo they were \"relaxing on a Grand Bahama beach\" when a resort employee allegedly gave them drinks spiked with a cocktail of drugs including benzodiazepines.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"They were given drinks – a coconut and pineapple drink − spiked with a series of drug and narcotics,\" the women's Miami-based attorney, Nicholas Gerson told USA TODAY Thursday. \"They became inebriated and were both taken away and raped.\"\n\nAt the time of the reported attacks, Gerson said his clients, both 31, were unaware of the recent travel warning and \"not aware of any warnings given by Carnival.\"\n\nWhen reached by phone on Thursday, Dobson's husband told USA TODAY he and his wife live in Lancaster, Kentucky, a small city about 35-miles south of Lexington.\n\nHe also said his wife and Shearer are childhood friends who both grew up in Danville, Kentucky, a town about 10 miles west of Lancaster and deferred additional questions to his wife's lawyer.\n\n'A two-for-one drink deal'\n\nGerson said on the day of the alleged assaults, his clients went on an excursion called \"Pirate's Cove Beach Getaway\" and were taken to the island by a shuttle arranged by Carnival.\n\nThere, the attorney said, a resort staffer offered them a two-for-one drink deal, and after taking just a few sips, they realized something was off with the beverage.\n\nDobson told Cuomo the friends went to look for seashells for their children with \"a male resort employee\" and the next thing she remembered \"was waking up while she was being assaulted by a uniformed male resort staffer.\"\n\n“I came to in the process of my rape,” Dobson told Cuomo. “I want people to be safe... Two’s not enough.\" She said they \"thought as best friends … that we could protect each other and to be safe.\"\n\nThat wasn't enough, she said.\n\nShortly after the reported rapes, both women told Cuomo, local authorities and other staff at the resort were able to identify the men accused of sexually assaulting the women through video surveillance.\n\nThe women took toxicology tests when they returned to the ship and reported the rapes, Gerson said\n\nToxicology results, he said, found little if no alcohol in his clients' systems, but the women tested positive for benzos and other drugs including cocaine.\n\n'Support for the two guests'\n\nCarnival released the following statement to USA TODAY on Thursday:\n\n\"While ashore in Freeport, Bahamas on an independent shore excursion, two guests on Carnival Elation reported to Bahamian police that they were sexually assaulted at a local beach.

Rodney Smith Jr. tweeted Friday that he was headed home from Hawaii after cutting grass on Oahu. He got to his last state with help from Delta Air Lines. He says he will now continue providing free lawn care to the elderly, disabled, single mothers and veterans in Alabama. Smith was inspired to begin a free yard mowing service in 2015 after seeing an elderly man cutting his lawn. That morphed into a mission to cut grass for service veterans in every U.S. state. Smith drove across the country this spring posting photos of himself with veterans as he cut their lawns. Individual and corporate donations helped pay for hotel rooms and other expenses.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The National Park Service has completed a project to relieve an interspecies traffic jam. A new elevated bridge and boardwalk across the Brooks River in Katmai National Park and Preserve has replaced a river-level bridge that was often closed to human tourists because it was occupied by locals – brown bears. The replacement for the old floating bridge was more than a decade in the making. Bears catching salmon are a huge draw for the park on the Alaska Peninsula, the arm of land extending from Alaska’s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. The park service estimates 2,200 brown bears inhabit the park, a number exceeding the people who live on the peninsula. The new bridge, which cost $5.6 million, features bear-proof gates on both ends.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A philanthropic arm of Jay-Z’s entertainment company Roc Nation has offered to provide legal support for a couple who say police used excessive force and threatened to shoot them in an incident caught on video. Dravon Ames, 22, and his pregnant fiancee, Aisha Harper, 24, were pulled over by Phoenix police May 29. They allege police pointed a gun at their children, threatened them, and physically harmed Ames and their daughter because the child took a doll from a dollar store. The couple is demanding $10 million from the city of Phoenix. A notice of claim filed Thursday says the police officers committed battery, unlawful imprisonment, false arrest and infliction of emotional distress in addition to violating their civil rights. Team ROC has secured high-profile attorney Alex Spiro to join the family’s legal team pro-bono.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Long before she became the spokeswoman for the Trump administration, Sarah Huckabee Sanders was a well-known figure in the Natural State who appeared in campaign ads for her dad, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, and learned about the state’s rough-and-tumble politics by working on his campaign and others. Now, speculation that Sanders may run for governor in her home state shakes up a race that’s three years away but was already expected to be a crowded and expensive fight among Republicans. Trump announced Thursday that Sanders was leaving as White House press secretary and encouraged her to run for Arkansas governor, a job her dad held for 10 1/ 2 years. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson was re-elected in November, and the seat will open up in 2022 when he’s barred by term limits from running again.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: High school graduation speeches are usually full of praise for teachers and officials. So it was more than a little unusual when a valedictorian sarcastically thanked them for making her self-sufficient by doing nothing to help her. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports San Ysidro High senior Nataly Buhr initially thanked parents, friends and some teachers. Then she thanked a school counselor for teaching her to fend for herself by never being available and the main office staff for not informing her of scholarships until a day before the deadline. Buhr also thanked a teacher she said was regularly intoxicated for being an example of “the dangers of alcoholism.” The district says Buhr’s speech didn’t follow her pre-approved version and was inappropriate. But Buhr’s mother said she couldn’t be prouder.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two decades after the name “Columbine” became synonymous with a school shooting, the suburban Denver community surrounding the school is debating whether it’s time to tear down a building that also became a beacon for people obsessed with the killings. School officials say the number of people trying to get close to or even inside the school reached record levels this year, the 20th anniversary of the 1999 attack that killed 13 people. People try to peek into the windows of the school library, mistaking it for the long-demolished room where most of the victims died, or ask people on campus how to take a tour. The buses full of tourists have mostly stopped over the years, but not the visitors. This year alone, security staff contacted more than 2,400 “unauthorized” people on Columbine’s campus.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Officials are kicking off an effort to encourage students graduating from high schools and others to consider attending one of the state’s 12 community colleges. The first in a series of events this summer will be held Monday at 11 a.m. at the Prince Technical High School in Hartford. The summer enrollment campaign is being dubbed “Aspire” and is focusing on those who may not have considered a post-secondary education. Admissions staff from Manchester and Capital Community Colleges will be on hand to talk to any interested potential students. In May, the Connecticut Board of Regents eliminated the application fee for Connecticut’s community colleges. Various officials will be on hand for Monday’s event, including Democratic U.S. Rep. John Larson and Connecticut State Colleges and Universities President Mark Ojakian.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As a guest on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Friday, actress and Wilmington native Aubrey Plaza joined Colbert for a segment called “Community Calendar,” in which the duo detailed and poked fun at events happening near the city. The show rolled a montage of local sites including the Caesar Rodney statue and the Rockford Tower. “You know what we say in Wilmington – it’s a Wilming-ton of fun,” Plaza said. “Oh, I’m Del-aware of that,” Colbert retorted. The two ran through a list of events including the Wilmington Pirate Festival on June 29 and the American Helicopter Museum and Education Center’s FatherFest on June 16. The description of Sunday’s FatherFest promised classic cars, motorcycles and a beer garden. “So stop by and see what happens when you mix vehicles, alcohol and middle-aged despair,” Plaza deadpanned.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The top economic official for the city is leaving his post to join Amazon. The Washington Post reports Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office announced the impending departure of Brian Kenner on Thursday. Kenner is the deputy mayor for planning and economic development and has been a part of the mayor’s Cabinet since she took office in 2015. He’s set to leave his District of Columbia role next month. The mayor will then appoint someone on an interim basis. Kenner previously worked to incentivize Amazon to build its second headquarters in the district. The online behemoth instead chose Arlington County, Virginia. Kenner told The Washington Business Journal that Amazon approached him about a month ago. He says he’ll work in the company’s D.C.-based policy shop.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A South Carolina woman has reached the Florida Keys, completing a 2,575-mile walk to give attention to the opioid overdose crisis. Jessie Grieb finished her East Coast Overdose Awareness Walk on Friday at Key West’s Southernmost Point in the Continental U.S. marker. Friday marked the fourth anniversary of her brother Brian’s death by accidental overdose. Grieb’s boyfriend succumbed to heroin, and she has struggled herself with addiction since she was 17. The Pawleys Island resident started her journey in Fort Kent, Maine, on July 28, 2018, after she had suffered a relapse. To help carry supplies, Grieb pushed a small cart named “Lieutenant Dan” in honor of the “Forrest Gump” character who dealt with addiction in the movie.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Grammy-nominated rapper 21 Savage has given $25,000 to the Southern Poverty Law Center after the watchdog organization helped him while he was in federal immigration custody earlier this year. The rapper, whose real name is She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested Feb. 3 in what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said was a targeted operation over his expired visa. Abraham-Joseph is a British citizen and moved to the U.S. when he was 7. In a statement, immigration attorney Charles Kuck said the Atlanta-based rapper wants to support the work the SPLC has done to give immigrants legal representation and fight what Kuck called ICE’s “oppressively adverse conditions of detention.” The rapper spent 10 days at the Irwin County Detention Center before he was released on a $100,000 bond.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man injured during a rockfall in a state park was among five people cited for trespassing, officials say. State officials cited Lincoln Hittner of Honolulu for trespassing in a closed park, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Hittner was treated for minor injuries by Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement officers in Sacred Falls State Park, officials say. Hittner described his near-miss with the rockfall as “15 seconds of terror,” officials say. He was among a group of six that included Hawaii residents and a visiting Australian who all received citations, authorities say. Sacred Falls State Park has been closed and warning signs posted since a 1999 accident left eight people dead and dozens hurt, officials say. The state has extensively publicized the dangers of entering closed areas, including a video about Sacred Falls, according to the Department of Land and Natural Resources.\n\nIdaho\n\nPreston: The cult comedy “Napoleon Dynamite” turns 15 years old this month, a milestone for a movie filmed in the Gem State that became an early breakaway hit in today’s era of pop-culture geek celebration. The movie that created the “Vote for Pedro” T-shirt and made Napoleon’s disgusted exclamation of “gosh!” into a 2004 catchphrase is celebrating its anniversary this month. Made for just $400,000 in and around Franklin County, it would ultimately gross over $46 million as a word-of-mouth hit before social media took off. The movie told the story of its socially awkward title character, who ultimately triumphed because of his quirks rather than in spite of them. Its success added to a rising profile for unapologetic nerds just before hits like “The Big Bang Theory” ushered in a new era of geek glory.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Some endangered birds could ground a beachfront music festival proposed for late August. Promoters of Mamby on the Beach are seeking a permit from the Chicago Park District to move the show to Montrose Beach on the city’s north side. But two piping plovers lately have been making the beach their home. Four eggs were discovered and turned over to the Lincoln Park Zoo last week. The plovers appear to be making a new nest, said Louise Clemency of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. MAMBY on the Beach is scheduled to take place Aug. 23-24 and expected to draw up to 20,000 people to the Lake Michigan lakefront each day. But Jill Niland of the Montrose Lakefront Coalition says there are concerns about the number of people expected to attend and noise pollution that could disrupt the piping plovers. The small shorebird is on state endangered species lists and listed as threatened at the federal level.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A change state lawmakers made this year to a tax incentive for startups is being hailed as a big win for the tech industry because it promises to make it easier for fledgling businesses to attract out-of-state investors. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports that legislation signed by Gov. Eric Holcomb will allow investors to transfer Indiana’s Venture Capital Investment tax credits, starting next year. Transferring the credits will allow out-of-state investors to essentially sell them to someone in the state who can take advantage. Tech community leaders say the change will encourage out-of-state individuals to invest in Indiana startups. The state’s VCI tax credit program allows someone who invests in an Indiana startup to claim a tax credit worth 20% of the investment. The credit is capped at $1 million.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Torrential rain this spring prevented most Midwest farmers from planting their crops, but while the federal government provides help to growers of corn and soybeans, those who grow so-called specialty crops are largely on their own. Although the lack of federal safety net programs for farmers who grow everything from arugula to zucchini isn’t new, one of the wettest springs in U.S. history has focused attention on the special status of commodity crops, primarily corn, soybeans, cotton, rice and wheat. Iowa organic farmer Andrew Dunham shrugs at the situation, noting that “there are no federal bailouts for vegetable farmers.” Iowa State University economist Chad Hart says crops like corn and soybeans are treated differently because they’re so important to the national economy, and shortages would be painful, particularly to the livestock industry.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Two endangered Mexican wolf pups from a Kansas zoo have been released into the wild in Arizona. The Wichita Eagle reports that a male puppy, named Traveler, and a female puppy, named Jaunt, were born at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita. They were 2 weeks old last month when they were placed with a litter whose mother is wild. Mexican wolves are considered critically endangered, with fewer than 150 members of the species remaining in the wild. They are native to the southwestern United States in Arizona and New Mexico, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will remotely observe the pack to monitor the results of the cross-fostering. But senior zookeeper Nancy Smith says the pack seems to be doing well.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Louisville Zoo has narrowed a naming competition for its new bongo calf down to three characters from the beloved Marvel masterpiece “Guardians of the Galaxy”: Drax, Groot and Rocket. Until June 23, zoo visitors can make a donation to choose their favorite name. There will be a naming kiosk with three slots in the plaza to the right near the zoo’s entrance. The calf will be given the name that receives the most donations, to be announced during the week of June 24. All donations in the competition will go to the zoo’s conservation efforts. Bongos are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species and are listed as a “near threatened” species. The future Drax, Groot or Rocket is on exhibit along with his mother and the other bongos.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state court official has agreed to take steps to make sure defendants in criminal cases aren’t jailed because they cannot afford bail. The agreement is detailed in a federal court order filed Thursday involving Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell and plaintiffs who accused Cantrell of violating an earlier federal judgment regarding low-income defendants. As a magistrate judge in the criminal district court in New Orleans, Cantrell sets bail for people arrested on various state charges. The agreement details requirements for determining whether a defendant can afford bail and whether the defendant is a flight risk or poses a danger when alternatives to bail are considered. U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon issued Thursday’s order detailing the agreement and closing the case against Cantrell.\n\nMaine\n\nDover-Foxcroft: Police say a moose smashed through the window of a vacant pizzeria. Piscataquis County corrections officer Matt Poole snapped a photo of the moose stepping through broken glass onto East Main Street early Friday. The Dover-Foxcroft Police Department posted on Facebook, “We found the suspect and they are not in custody. Boring right?” Maine has plenty of moose, and sometimes they wander into towns. But Police Chief Ryan Reardon says it was the first time in 26 years he’d seen one run into a building. State biologists estimate Maine’s moose population is between 50,000 and 70,000.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Museum of Art has so far this year added more than 70 contemporary and historic artworks to its broad collection. BMA director Christopher Bedford said in a statement that the new acquisitions highlight the curatorial team’s vision in forging connections “across artists and movements within the museum’s collection.” Additions include 19th-century prints by Italian art nouveau illustrator Manuel Orazi, a film by Cuban American artist Ana Mendieta and a painting by contemporary American artist Mary Lovelace O’Neal. Various new pieces were purchased with proceeds from last year’s auction of seven works by 20th-century artists, including Andy Warhol, to help diversify and contemporize its collection. The BMA has nearly 100,000 pieces, including the world’s largest holding of Henri Matisse’s creations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bit of seat belt art is part of a new public information campaign aimed at getting young men to buckle up when they’re behind the wheel. State officials say they commissioned teens through Artists for Humanity to create a free-standing art installation that will help deliver the message that seat belts can save lives. The 6-foot-by-12-foot artwork is wrapped with real seat belts and will be displayed at locations around the state during the summer. The new campaign is called “Love Clicks” and is based on research that suggests young men are more likely to use seat belts if someone they love asks them to do so. Data suggests that while seat belt use is increasing in Massachusetts, men still buckle up at a lower rate than women.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pride flags are flying on the state office building for the first time in Michigan’s history. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered that starting Saturday, two of the iconic rainbow flags will fly on the George W. Romney Building to help celebrate June as Pride Month in Michigan. The flying of the flags comes after Whitmer signed a proclamation designating June as Pride Month to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising in New York City. A police raid on a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn triggered a series of riots and sparked the nascent LGBT movement in the country and around the world. In a news release, Whitmer said celebrating Pride Month helps ensure that members of Michigan’s LGBTQ community “are treated with the respect they deserve.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota regents have voted to allow beer and wine sales in the general seating sections of the school’s basketball and hockey arenas. Friday’s vote was unanimous and comes as the school is trying to drive up revenue at sporting events. The university has been dropping some ticket prices in response to declining attendance. The Star Tribune reports that athletic director Mark Coyle told regents that campus police back the expanded alcohol sales, as does a fan advisory council. TCF Bank Stadium expanded alcohol sales to general seating areas in 2012. Overall alcohol revenue at the football stadium has been about $1.3 million annually, with most of that coming from general seating, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: Five more members have been added to a hall of fame that honors the arts and entertainment in the Magnolia State. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience announced the additions Thursday of four musicians and one literary figure. Country singer Tammy Wynette of Tremont was lauded as the first lady of country music. Singer and guitarist Bo Diddley helped bridge the blues and rock ’n’ roll. Pianist and singer Jerry Lee Lewis is one of the last surviving pioneers of rock ’n’ roll. Margaret Walker Alexander was a poet, novelist and Jackson State University literature professor. John Lee Hooker was a blues guitarist and five-time Grammy Award winner. The new designees join 23 existing members. The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience in Meridian includes exhibits, performance spaces and a recording studio.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A bar that served as a set location for the movie “Gone Girl” will reopen later this month. The Southeast Missourian reports that The Bar in downtown Cape Girardeau had been closed since last fall. Representative for the management company that owns it and several other downtown properties say the establishment will resume serving drinks June 27. Formerly a catering business, the corner site was transformed into The Bar for the 2014 film “Gone Girl” starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike and Neil Patrick Harris. After the movie was released, the set was converted into a real restaurant and bar. General manager Derek Vaughn says it will no longer serve food and will only be open Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 4 p.m. until 1:30 a.m.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Lawmakers did not have enough support to override four vetoes by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Poll results released Friday showed lawmakers did not reach the two-thirds majority needed in the state House and the Senate to override vetoes on a bill that would have given health insurers the ability to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, two bills that would have created tax breaks and a campus free-speech bill. Bullock vetoed a bill proposed by Republican State Auditor Matt Rosendale that sought to lower prescription drug prices by requiring pharmacy benefit managers to pass on drug manufacturer rebates to insurers. Bullock said the proposal would actually increase costs. In total, lawmakers voted 108-40 in favor of Rosendale’s bill during the session, but the override effort fell short by five votes in each chamber.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Visitors to six state recreation areas will be allowed to light off fireworks July 4. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission says those recreation areas are Branched Oak near Malcolm, Fort Kearny near Kearney, Pawnee near Emerald, Wagon Train near Hickman, and those near Memphis and Fremont. Those parks will permit fireworks from 8 a.m. until midnight on July 4 only. Signs at recreation areas will point the way to designated fireworks sites, and their boundaries will be clearly marked. Use of fireworks elsewhere in state areas or at other times is prohibited. Only fireworks approved for sale in Nebraska are permitted, and visitors must pick up expended fireworks and deposit them in appropriate containers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Burning Man won’t be growing this year, but there could be at least one major change upon entry – drug screenings. The Bureau of Land Management on Friday issued the final environmental impact statement for Burning Man, denying the Burning Man organization its sought-after growth to 100,000 people but granting it more time to address a number of environmental and security concerns. The federal agency may, however, hire a private security firm this year to conduct drug screenings. Or it might wait until 2020, according to BLM spokesman Rudy Evenson. As for the growth of the event, the population cap will remain at 80,000 people for the weeklong event held each year over Labor Day weekend in Northern Nevada’s Black Rock Desert.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton Falls: Enthusiastic clapping – and some furious flapping – marked the end to the saga of designating an official state raptor. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday signed a bill honoring the red-tailed hawk. As applause broke out, a bird being held just over his shoulder began flapping its wings. The bill was proposed by Hampton Falls fourth graders four years ago, but it was killed after one lawmaker injected the issue of abortion into the debate by saying the hawk’s habit of tearing apart prey “limb from limb” would make it an ideal mascot for Planned Parenthood. The students, now in eighth grade, lobbied for a new bill this year and were successful. Sununu told them they exemplified a lesson in perseverance.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A year after gunfire shattered the city’s annual Art All Night festival, hundreds flocked to this year’s celebration of local art, music, food and films – even though, strictly speaking, it no longer quite lived up to the name. The formerly “all night” festival took a break from 1 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday before resuming for the morning and afternoon. And for the first time in the festival’s 13-year history, the event was fenced off, and attendees had to go through security checkpoints before entering the event space that included visible police and security officers. The June 17 shooting last year left a suspect dead and 22 people injured in what authorities said looked like neighborhood gang dispute. But those attending this year to examine the more than 800 pieces of art displayed inside and outside the Roebling Wireworks Building spoke of moving forward rather than looking backward.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state’s film industry appears to be on the brink of a boom thanks to abortion law controversies in other states and expanded incentives. A recent spike in film production in the state comes as Hollywood targets both Georgia and Louisiana over recently passed restrictive abortion laws, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The political developments are being watched closely in New Mexico, which is poised to benefit even though state officials have said there’s no organized campaign to lure film productions from those states. The jump also comes as New Mexico is set to more than double its annual state spending cap on film incentives. In addition, NBCUniversal announced Friday it will build a television and film studio in a warehouse district just north of downtown Albuquerque as it seeks to expand its footprint in one of the fastest-growing film production hubs in the country.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City police say a 29-year-old officer died Friday in the department’s third suspected suicide in less than two weeks. Police say he shot himself in the head on a Staten Island street near the 121st Precinct to which the officer was assigned. His identity had not been released as of late Friday. The week before, two longtime officers died in suspected suicides within 24 hours of each other. Deputy Chief Steven Silks was found dead in a police vehicle in Queens on June 5. Detective Joseph Calabrese was found the next day at a Brooklyn beach. Police say both died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. In the wake of the deaths, Commissioner James O’Neill sent a note reminding the more than 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilians in the NYPD that help is available if they’re feeling depressed, hopeless or otherwise contemplating self-harm.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state won’t clear voting-machine makers to sell their systems to county elections boards until it learns more about who owns them, the elections board chairman said Friday. The decision comes amid worries of foreign election interference that have grown since special counsel Robert Mueller’s April report into Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election. Mueller’s report “essentially says everybody should be concerned about this, and everybody should be looking harder at a lot of these things to make sure we’re protected as best we can be,” said Robert Cordle, the head of the state elections board. “It’s just a matter of doing our due diligence now.” The state board is giving the three companies that have already passed several rounds of screening until Friday to disclose anyone holding a 5% or greater interest in their company, their parent company or any subsidiaries.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota plans to acquire the Ruth Meiers Hospitality House’s property in Bismarck and turn the facility into affordable housing. Lutheran Social Services is partnering with CommunityWorks North Dakota on the acquisition. The plan is to take over the facility by the end of summer. The sale of the site is “in the works,” Lutheran Social Services CEO Jessica Thomasson told The Bismarck Tribune. Choice Bank took ownership of the facility last month. “The reason we got involved was to try to preserve these 85 units of affordable housing in Bismarck because it’s hard when a community loses an asset like that to ever get it back,” Thomasson said. She said the plans include retaining the 85 apartments, renovating some of the units and common areas, and turning underutilized space into 20 additional apartments.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Farmer Jay Butterfield survived a harrowing afternoon recently after being buried up to his neck inside a soybean bin. The 70-year-old was trying to break up wet clumps of the crop inside a 30-foot-tall bin when he sank up to his knees. The material along the bin’s sides began to engulf him. Within 15 minutes, Butterfield was buried up to his neck and thought he was probably going to die. The three-hour rescue effort on the farm north of Cincinnati involved 52 first responders from a dozen departments. Butterfield acknowledges he’s a lucky man. Last year, 30 people were buried in grain on farms, and half died. Butterfield’s friend Charlie Groh died in a corn bin in 2013 in a neighboring township. It happens so often, in fact, that fire departments in farming regions undergo special training and acquire equipment just for these situations.\n\nOklahoma\n\nConcho: Families and friends of missing or slain American Indian women and girls are again calling for justice for their loved ones. About 200 people gathered Friday near the headquarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Concho. Many wore red and marched, holding signs with pictures of women on them. Similar demonstrations have taken place in other states amid growing concern that police nationwide are not adequately identifying or reporting cases of missing and murdered Native American and Alaska Native women and girls. Those demographic groups have some of the nation’s highest rates of sexual and domestic violence. Kateri Fletcher, a Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal government official who helped organize the event, said it was designed to bring awareness and show support for families who still need answers.\n\nOregon\n\nAurora: A global hemp research lab in the state is part of a larger movement to bring the standardization to hemp that traditional crops like corn and cotton enjoy. It’s a critical step toward accountability and consistency in an industry that’s sprung up almost overnight since the U.S. legalized hemp last year. The Global Hemp Innovation Center was unveiled recently by Oregon State University and will be the largest such research hub in the U.S. Oregon State will also begin certifying hemp seeds so that farmers can be confident they’re getting quality seeds. A national review board for hemp varieties is also getting up and running. Interest in the cannabis crop has exploded because of hemp-derived CBD, a compound marketed as having health benefits but without the high caused by marijuana.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBloomsburg: For the past 15 years, Bloomsburg University students have been quietly stocking the shelves of a town food cupboard, donating more than a ton of food and more than $15,000 in meal-plan funds each year. With the help of those donations, volunteers at the Bloomsburg Food Cupboard have been able to bag breakfast, lunch and snacks for elementary students from poor families to take home each weekend, says cupboard director Martha Sheehe. University students who have meal plan “FLEX” money left in their accounts at the end of the academic year can either spend it down or donate it, says Tom McGuire, director of media relations at BU. Sometimes students will buy cases of water or soda to drain their accounts, but many donate their remaining cash to ARAMARK, the university’s dining service, which then purchases food to fill the elementary students’ “Panther Packs.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has preserved 43 acres of open space to provide more recreational opportunities. The Department of Environmental Management says it’s using about $250,000 provided through open space bonds to permanently protect forested land in Charlestown for public recreational access. DEM Director Janet Coit says she’s delighted to secure this valuable parcel and encouraged residents to explore it. The property abuts DEM’s Burlingame Management Area. That area, with the adjoining Burlingame State Park, encompasses more than 4,000 contiguous acres of protected land that’s managed for public recreation, including fishing, hunting and camping. The department purchased the property from private landowners and, at their request, granted a conservation easement to the Charlestown Land Trust to increase the level of protection on the property.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSummerville: A mapping error from 1897 is causing 21st-century headaches for people living near Charleston. Surveyors 122 years ago messed up drawing the county line between Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports the mistake was officially corrected last year, leaving an apartment complex and a senior living home split between the two counties. State officials have been working for a decade to precisely map county boundaries. Tenants at the Farmington Village Apartments are told that the unit they select will decide whether their children go to schools in Berkeley County or Dorchester County. The Village at Summerville senior living complex is split, too, but has arranged to have Dorchester County Emergency Medical Service answer all of its calls. The redrawn boundary has changed tax bills too.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A business development center that was launched more than a decade ago on the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology campus is coming out of the shadows. The Rapid City Journal reports that the Ascent Innovation Center, which opened in a remote corner of the campus in 2006, has outgrown its space and is poised to expand to a more visible location, in downtown Rapid City. School officials say construction on the $12 million business incubator could begin this summer, thanks in part to a $3 million federal grant that puts the new center in range of being fully funded. The architect of the project is Wisconsin-based Strang Inc., which specializes in design of innovation centers and research parks. The building is slated for completion in late 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Peanuts, cracker jacks, hot dogs ... mayonnaise? One fan added a weird twist to baseball stadium cuisine when he started eating from a mayonnaise jar during the Memphis Redbirds’ 8-4 loss to the Las Vegas Aviators at AutoZone Park on Saturday. He started eating early in the game, and by the fourth inning he moved to a different seat and continued eating from the jar with a spoon before security had him moved to another seat. That didn’t stop the mayo eater as he found a new place and continued eating it in the fifth inning. The Redbirds’ Twitter account kept a running commentary, as insiders were apparently as shocked and confused as fans watching it on social media. Even Minor League Baseball’s Twitter account got wind of the fan’s snack and tweeted further disgust.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The groups behind an innovative way of rebuilding homes after a natural disaster say their approach will save money and get people into housing more quickly. They’re hoping a bill signed last week by Gov. Greg Abbott related to disaster planning will boost their efforts. The housing program known as Rapido, Spanish for fast, debuted its first such home built in Houston last week. Under the program, a core unit made up of pre-built panels is assembled. A family lives in this core while the rest of the house is built around them. The Texas agency that has handled housing recovery following Hurricane Harvey in 2017 says it supports such innovations but says rule changes would be needed to free up federal funding to support such ideas.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: When John Frey’s family requested 101 birthday cards to celebrate the World War II veteran’s 101st birthday in Utah, they were expecting to get 500 at most. At a celebration June 8, a day after his birthday, Frey ended up with well over 5,000 cards, the Daily Herald reports. According to the report, Frey’s request spread quickly after the Associated Press picked up the story from the Daily Herald in May and it appeared in news outlets across the country. The cards came from all 50 states and at least 12 countries. Entire classrooms of children, military veterans and Utah’s elected officials wanted to wish the former mechanic/machinist for the U.S. Army a happy birthday. Frey said he had not expected to ever get so many cards.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: U.S. production of maple syrup increased slightly this year, even though the season was shorter than last year’s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that the country produced 4.2 million gallons of the pancake topper, up 1% from 2018. Leading producer Vermont made more than 2 million gallons, an increase over 2018. Data shows Vermont was followed by New York, Maine and Wisconsin. The USDA says the earliest sap flow reported was Jan. 5 in New York. The season lasted an average of 30 days in syrup-producing states, compared with 42 last year. Amanda Voyer, of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association, says the conditions made for some strong days of sap flow in trees.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Attorney General Mark Herring is calling for the legalization of marijuana. Herring said Saturday that Virginia should start decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana and eventually legalize the drug. The Democratic attorney general said criminal prosecutions are costly to the state and local governments and disproportionately affect African Americans. Herring made the remarks in an op-ed in the Daily Press and in comments to reporters at a Democratic fundraiser in Richmond. Herring’s announcement won’t have any practical impact on marijuana prosecutions, which are typically handled at the local level. But Herring said he hopes his public support for legalization will help spur lawmakers to act. The Republican-controlled General Assembly has killed past efforts to decriminalize marijuana.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: A Christian organization has fired a teenager from his job as a camp counselor because he is gay. The Bellingham Herald reports Jace Taylor says he was terminated Tuesday after being hired last month by THE FIRS to be a Fir Creek camp counselor. The nondenominational Christian organization confirmed that Taylor’s sexual orientation was the reason for his firing. Executive Director Tom Beaumont says when it became evident that Taylor didn’t personally align with the group’s statements of faith, it determined it could not use him in the role. Under state law, an employer cannot discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation. QLaw Foundation executive director Denise Diskin says religious nonprofit employers are not defined as employers under the law. Taylor says he intends to picket on the first day of camp to inform people there of the situation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRoanoke: Students participating in the state’s new program for free tuition at public community colleges will have to pass a drug test that includes marijuana. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board of the West Virginia Community and Technical College System listened to a presentation Thursday from a consultant helping launch the program. Kathy Butler said the testing will include the marijuana component THC as well as opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and other drugs. Butler said the testing is modeled after that used by WorkForce West Virginia, a state job placement and training organization. Students will be required to pass the drug test within 60 days of the start of a semester to receive free tuition for that semester. The policy does allow exemptions for legally prescribed medicines.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Hiring in the restaurant and hotel industry is difficult right now. More than 4,000 positions in the area are advertised on one of the largest job sites, Indeed. Hospitality businesses in the city say they don’t have enough workers ready to serve the tens of thousands of people who will come to town for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. At the same time, Milwaukee has large segments of its population that are unemployed and could benefit from work in the service industry. “It’s ships passing in the night – people looking for employees and the people looking for jobs,” Mayor Tom Barrett says. Business and city leaders are starting to make plans for how to use the DNC to establish a pipeline for workers to enter the service industry –a resource that would exist after the convention leaves.\n\nWyoming\n\nRiverton: Students at a high school here will be able to take classes on the Northern Arapaho language. The Riverton Ranger reports that the Fremont County School District 25 Board of Trustees has approved offering two courses of the language at Riverton High School. Riverton Principal John Griffith says parents and students have been suggesting the idea for years in the district near the Wind River Reservation. He says the school now has a staff member with a desire to teach the language. The first class will acquaint students with the basic sounds of the Arapaho language. They also will learn the Arapaho alphabet. In the second class, students will use the basic sounds to form Arapaho words and phrases in order to have conversations or tell short stories.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/16/seven-candidates-running-for-des-moines-city-council-ward-1-in-2023-election-indira-sheumaker-seat/70922300007/", "title": "Des Moines Ward 1: Meet the candidates running for City Council in ...", "text": "Editor's note: Kimberley Strope-Boggus announced Nov. 1 she suspended her campaign.\n\nFollowing the resignation of former Des Moines City Council member Indira Sheumaker, seven candidates are vying for the Ward 1 seat in a special election, including Rob Barron, Chris Coleman, Kathy Hellstern, Dennis McCullough, RJ Miller, Rose Marie Smith and Kimberley Strope-Boggus.\n\nThe Des Moines Register asked each candidate to respond to questions on why they're running and the issues facing the city's northwest side.

Our council lacks the viewpoint of any people of color, even though we live in Iowa’s most diverse city. I would be the first Latino elected to the council. I have the track record to do the job on Day 1. I served on the Des Moines School Board for eight years, including throughout the pandemic. I’m the only candidate in this field that brings that mix of underrepresented perspective and experience.\n\nChris Coleman: I love Des Moines. It’s done so much for me. I want to contribute a fresh perspective to its future; a perspective grounded in a proven track record of hard work, innovation and leadership. The story of my life can be traced through the neighborhoods of Ward 1. I am excited for this opportunity to serve the amazing neighborhoods in which I was born, educated, raised a family, worship, and now work and live. The city needs a healthy dose of common sense and I know I can deliver. I’ll work hard. I treat everyone fairly. I’ll communicate. I’ll deliver results.\n\nKathy Hellstern: I am running because, as a neighborhood leader, I’ve been in the neighborhoods in Ward 1 over the last several years having conversations with neighbors. I believe I can advocate well for Ward 1 neighbors at the city level. I want to sit down with neighbors to listen to their needs and then consider those needs when decisions are being made. I want to stay in touch and communicate with them about what’s happening at the city level. I think it would be good for a voice to come from a part of the ward that frequently doesn’t feel heard.\n\nDennis McCullough: I wish to improve life for everyone in Ward 1.\n\nRJ Miller: I'm running to give a voice to the marginalized neighborhoods within Ward 1 who have been neglected, underserved, and unheard. I have seen the suffering of the people by way of violence, homelessness, drugs, poverty, hopelessness, and despair so I will be fighting to address these issues by pushing for lower property taxes, safer neighborhoods, drivable roads, and lowering the priority of marijuana with law enforcement. But I also equally want all neighborhoods in Ward 1 to have representation and equal access to resources and support regardless of one's ZIP code.\n\nRose Marie Smith: Homelessness.\n\nKimberley Strope-Boggus: My Ward 1 neighbors deserve a member of City Council who shows up and gets things done. My wife and I chose to raise our children here. For us, diversity, equity, and inclusion are not simply talking points, they’re our way of life. We are raising our children here in the hopes that Des Moines will remain a welcoming city for future generations. I’ve been present in Ward 1, and I want to bring my vision of responsible growth, affordability, and sustainability to Des Moines City Council. We need to elect leaders that reflect the diversity of our beautiful city.\n\nWhat is the biggest issue facing your community and how would you address it?\n\nRob Barron: Families need hope that this is the community where they can set down roots. For some, that means that we need to address basic needs like affordable housing and child care. For others, it means living in a dynamic city with a council that reflects that dynamism, eager to try new ideas to solve generational problems.\n\nChris Coleman: We have a number of big issues right now from safety to affordability to infrastructure and more. In Ward 1, we are on the cusp of a significant development boom that is critical. We have a long list of large properties that need strong advocacy to bring them forward. I have the business and community experience to go toe-to-toe with developers to make sure that the development is good for the current residents, as well as the existing businesses. If we do these wrong, our neighborhoods will suffer for a generation. I’ll sweat the details. I won’t let you down.\n\nKathy Hellstern: Currently, the biggest issue facing the Ward 1 community is representation. We’ve just been through something difficult and we are ready to return to having the same representation as other wards. I am willing to be accessible to my neighbors. I will answer the phone and respond to emails. I will attend meetings and make time to have conversations with neighbors and neighborhood groups. I look forward to having these conversations and acting as a conduit to the city for my neighbors. I am already advocating for Ward 1 neighbors and want to do it on a larger scale.\n\nDennis McCullough: My major goal is trying to get a grocery store and more grocery options for Ward 1.\n\nRJ Miller: The biggest issue in the more marginalized neighborhoods is lack of resources. I would address it by being more preventative vs reactive. Bringing in good jobs can help those who are in poverty, building strong partnerships with mental health institutions and substance abuse institutions and creating a public safety system that works for everyone. Creating fresh ideas to approach violence by getting to the root cause and by using a three-tier system, a de-escalation team consisting of community ex-gang members or people who live in marginalized neighborhoods, a victim advocacy team to support victims, and a support team to offer referrals on jobs, education, therapy.\n\nRose Marie Smith: Homelessness. Mayor-elect, Ward 1-elect, Ward 2, Ward 3 and Ward 4. Let work together to eliminate homelessness. This is not an issue to separate us. This is a position of trust we must extend to children, mothers, fathers, grandparents, great-grandparents and veterans of our communities.\n\nKimberley Strope-Boggus: For context: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2021/11/23/gun-violence-injuries-spike-des-moines-worried-leaders-vow-action/8639231002/ As a wife and mother of four, like many families in Des Moines, my top concern is the safety and well-being of my friends, family, and neighbors. Gun violence remains on the rise in Des Moines, especially when these weapons fall into the hands of those suffering from mental illness. Like many of my neighbors, I know people who have been directly or indirectly affected by the rise in gun injuries. On City Council, I will work with community leaders, law enforcement, and stakeholders to help families and teachers recognize the warning signs before violence happens.\n\nHow would you work with community leaders, developers and stakeholders to improve access to affordable housing in Des Moines?\n\nRob Barron: I learned at a recent United Way board meeting that in Polk County we have a gap of more than 11,000 housing units and that will continue to grow as the population increases. We need an “all of the above” strategy for solutions and partners to make the progress we need. I would enter the council with strong connections to local funders and community organizations. Our work has to happen neighborhood by neighborhood with creativity and sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of residents.\n\nChris Coleman: I have always prioritized affordable housing for families and those struggling to make ends meet. I always will. I believe our city can do more to make this a reality, and you can count on me to support this important issue. I have a fresh perspective on what works and what doesn’t. When we invest in our current neighborhoods and improve run-down houses, we not only create affordable housing, but we improve the area for the neighbors who are paying taxes and trying to make it strong. I’ll lead a new era of sustainable, dignified affordable housing that improves neighborhoods.\n\nKathy Hellstern: Access to affordable housing must happen at different levels. I will support, with funding and zoning considerations, multi-family developments that assist neighbors in low- and mid-points of our area median income; especially if these developments promote community building and help neighbors achieve better credit to continue to attain housing that fits their needs. I will continue to help develop and expand the city-supported Community Land Trust project to help those who are ready to own a home afford to do so. I will support the ION Program, which helps neighbors maintain their homes and keep them livable while stabilizing neighborhoods.\n\nDennis McCullough: It would be great if this wasn’t an issue. People need housing; however, everything is unaffordable anymore and the prices keep going up. I think it is time to look at how things are being done instead of starting a new project.\n\nRJ Miller: I would partner with our current affordable housing programs and community leaders, nonprofits, and churches, create community forums to make sure the information is going to those who need it. Outreach and organizing is needed.\n\nRose Marie Smith: We must work together to create affordable housing and integrated health care, build career pathways, develop education connections, strengthen the crisis response system and reduce criminal justice involvement. Last but not least, we should build partnerships between the homeless stakeholders, developers and community leaders. The average age of homeless community members is 37 to 46. Their immediate needs are shelter, food and clothing.\n\nKimberley Strope-Boggus: One of my top priorities on the City Council will be to push for thoughtful development that puts people first and attracts families and small businesses to Des Moines instead of losing out to the suburbs. Our neighborhoods should not only be affordable but also safe and nurturing so our children can feel safe and families can have a peace of mind. I will be a strong advocate for affordable housing, including wraparound services and dignity for the city’s unhoused population. This is a complex issue that needs to be addressed by leaders, stakeholders, and developers together in collaboration.\n\nHow do you envision the future of public safety in the city and would you support a citizens' review board that would provide some oversight to the Des Moines Police Department?\n\nRob Barron: If it is done fairly, oversight helps us all thrive. I’m open to the concept of civilian review. But I think we miss the point if we just focus on that one remedy to the problem of lack of trust and meaningful connection between some community members and the police. Over the last three years, the public has become aware of present and historic misjustice in this country. Being a cop is also harder now, which makes it harder to hire police to build deeper connections within neighborhoods. The community would be well-served by some new voices on the council that can speak to both sides to bridge the gap.\n\nChris Coleman: The future of public safety is about partnerships. The progress made by our police, working with Broadlawns and Polk County on crisis and mental health, is an inspiring example for the future. I will continue to support partnerships that help our most vulnerable citizens and neighborhoods; programs that will allow our officers time to deal with our critical safety issues. I will work to support a humble, well-trained, diverse, and accountable police force. We have an amazing group of officers who are on the street protecting us each day and I fully support their commitment to keeping our community safe.\n\nKathy Hellstern: In my vision, Des Moines is a city where the basic needs of residents are met, reducing crime. A city where mental health needs are addressed over the long term, in a compassionate way. We support the CARES team and our violence interrupters to reduce the need for police interactions. We take care of housing needs and further reduce the need for police interventions in our neighborhoods. All city departments should be held accountable. There are already citizen commissions that make recommendations to the City Council, a commission on department accountability could help ensure all communities are treated equitably.\n\nDennis McCullough: I don’t envy the job of the police. They go places that no one wants to go, for pay that doesn’t properly compensate for the stress, and still deal with residents who believe they’re being harassed by the police. There is already the Civil Service Commission that has oversight of the DMPD. The police department has enough to worry about and there are plenty of people who voluntarily take it upon themselves to “audit the police.\" I don’t think that Civil Review Board is necessary, it would just become another level bureaucracy that would add more stress to an already stressful job.\n\nRJ Miller: I see public safety as being in the hands of the public. Yes I 100% support a community review board to give oversight to law enforcement. Law enforcement work for the public so the public should have a say in how policing is done within our community. We should fully support all law enforcement who protect and serve but for the ones that violate our civil and human rights they should be held accountable and to a higher standard due to the office and responsibility they hold. Nobody is bigger than law: not residents, politicians, or police, so oversight is needed.\n\nRose Marie Smith: I think \"oversight\" is not the position of the Citizen Review Board. Yes, I support a Citizen Review Board that would enhance these relationships. Iron sharpens iron - citizens can sharpen Des Moines Police Department and Des Moines police can sharpen citizens. They both have something to share. We both have to come to the table with solutions.\n\nKimberley Strope-Boggus: First of all, I am a strong supporter of the Des Moines Police Department, and I am a firm believer in providing them with the tools, training, and resources they need to keep both themselves and citizens safe. As a woman of color, I take racial profiling very seriously, and all accusations of police misconduct should be taken seriously. The Des Moines Police Department has systems currently in place to address any wrongdoing and misconduct. While I believe in transparency regarding complaints against law enforcement and that those complaints should be fully investigated, a citizens review board would be redundant.\n\nWhat are the steps you would take to reduce barriers to shelter and help community members experiencing homelessness improve their chances of finding stable, permanent housing?\n\nRob Barron: Elected leaders need to seek out and learn from community members living through a period of homelessness. The Unsheltered Study’s survey found that nearly all unsheltered individuals want a permanent home. Yet this problem will only get worse without further progress on affordable housing and basic needs. The city has to be fully bought into Polk County’s Community-Based Continuum of Care, because we have structures to serve our homeless population at varying levels of need. Right now the system lacks the ability to serve all that have requested support. We should continue to be supportive of permanent supportive housing developments like Anawim's Monarch Apartments in Ward 1.\n\nChris Coleman: My values and faith call me to do more for the homeless and vulnerable. When I was chair of the Homeless Coordinating Council, we expanded the beds available in shelters as the first step of helping get homeless off the streets. Specifically, I would replicate the Project Based Section 8 program in and outside the city of Des Moines to create permanent, sustainable housing units. The community expects the city to do more to help get the homeless into shelters/housing and off the streets, and out of parks, trails, and skywalks. We can do better. I will be a leader.\n\nKathy Hellstern: First, people need to be treated as humans. Judgment and blame should be removed from the conversation. Everyone’s needs are different and housing access can be affected by many factors. The community must be served by multiple tools. We should support the new Anawim project as a pilot. We should have more liaisons and social workers who can work with neighbors who have a difficult time staying housed, regulating themselves and remaining stable. We can’t just fund projects and say, “look what a great thing we did.” We have to continue to support neighbors in their journey to secure living.\n\nDennis McCullough: I am about personal accountability and I understand that sometimes people fall into hard times and need a little help to get back on their feet. I will gladly help those people to the fullest of my capabilities. I will work with the council in the process to ensure that the homeless shelters are adequately funded and make the process of integrating the homeless back into stable and affordable housing is successful.\n\nRJ Miller: I think we need to be more preventative when it comes to homelessness. We can reduce it by addressing mental health, poverty, poor education, drug addiction, etc. For the current homeless, I would want to expand more shelters and make them accessible seven days a week along with referrals to give them support systems in a humanizing way. I would also expand youth shelters. We have over 1,100 houseless teens in DMPS, that needs to be addressed. Food, clothing, and shelter is a human right. Nobody should be homeless or hungry in the great city of Des Moines.\n\nRose Marie Smith: The shelters have extended their hands to our homeless citizen. They are performing an excellent task. We must invite churches to the table. They are our 'brother's' keeper. Let's invite Realtors to the table. There are vacants lots, etc. The large homes in Ward 1, 2, 3, and 4 neighborhoods could be converted into boarding homes.\n\nKimberley Strope-Boggus: For context: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/des-moines/2023/01/18/des-moines-homeless-iowa-shelters-study-housing-solutions/69814146007/ This is an epidemic that has only gotten worse in recent years for Des Moines. In order to reduce the barriers, we must realize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The vast majority of people living unsheltered are dealing with mental illness and substance abuse issues, and one of the first things we should do is get people struggling with the help they need as soon as they need it. We also must improve existing shelter so they are clean and sanitary and treat those seeking shelter with the respect and dignity they deserve as human beings.\n\nVirginia Barreda is the Des Moines city government reporter for the Register.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFrom a spacecraft the size of a refrigerator plowing into an asteroid (deliberately) to a helicopter trying to catch a rocket plummeting back to Earth, 2022 offered surreal moments in space that could have been ripped from the pages of a science fiction movie script.\n\nAmong the memorable events were billionaires mapping out plans to explore the cosmos and scientists attempting to find answers to perplexing questions, only to discover deeper mysteries.\n\nResearchers managed to grow plants in lunar soil for the first time, while engineers successfully tested an inflatable heat shield that could land humans on Mars. And scientists determined that a rare interstellar meteor crashed into Earth nearly a decade ago.\n\nHere’s a look back at 10 times space travel and exploration felt more like a plot from a Hollywood movie than real life.\n\nCrashing a spacecraft into an asteroid — on purpose\n\nA NASA spacecraft intentionally slammed into Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger space rock named Didymos. While this collision seemed like something out of the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” the Double Asteroid Redirection Test was a demonstration of deflection technology — and the first conducted on behalf of planetary defense.\n\nDimorphos' rocky surface was the last thing the DART mission spacecraft saw before crashing into the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nMany tuned in on September 26 to watch as the surface of Dimorphos came into view for the first time, with DART’s cameras beaming back live imagery. The view ended after the spacecraft collided with the asteroid, but images captured by space telescopes and an Italian satellite provided dramatic photos of the aftermath.\n\nThe DART mission marked the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space. The spacecraft altered the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes. Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose a threat to Earth, but the double-asteroid system was a perfect target to test deflection technology.\n\nA heartbeat in space\n\nFast radio bursts in space have intrigued astronomers since their 2007 discovery, but a mysterious radio burst with a pattern similar to a heartbeat upped the ante this year.\n\nFast radio bursts, or FRBs, are intense, millisecond-long bursts of radio waves with unknown origins — which only fuels speculation that their cause is more alien than cosmic.\n\nAstronomers estimate that the “heartbeat signal” came from a galaxy roughly 1 billion light-years away, but the location and cause of the burst are unknown.\n\nAdditionally, astronomers also detected a powerful radio wave laser, known as a megamaser, and a spinning celestial object releasing giant bursts of energy unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\nMysterious space rings\n\nSpeaking of strange objects, astronomers made a new leap forward in understanding odd radio circles, or ORCs. No, they aren’t the goblinlike humanoids from “The Lord of the Rings” books, but these fascinating objects have baffled scientists since their discovery in 2020.\n\nAstronomers captured an image of odd radio circles in 2022. © Jayanne English (U. Manitoba)\n\nThe space rings are so massive that they each measure about 1 million light-years across — 16 times bigger than our Milky Way galaxy. Astronomers believe it takes the circles 1 billion years to reach their maximum size, and they are so large they have expanded past other galaxies.\n\nAstronomers took a new detailed photo of odd radio circles using the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory’s MeerKAT telescope, narrowing down the possible theories that might explain these celestial oddballs.\n\nEerie, unusual black holes\n\nBlack holes are known for behaving badly and shredding stars — so astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were surprised when they saw a black hole fueling star birth.\n\nTheir observation revealed a gaseous umbilical cord stretching from a black hole at the center of a dwarf galaxy to a stellar nursery where stars are born. The stream of gas provided by the black hole triggered a fireworks show of star birth as it interacted with the cloud, which led to a cluster of forming stars.\n\nThis year, astronomers also captured an image of the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of our galaxy, and Hubble spied a lone black hole wandering the Milky Way. And X-ray signals from black holes were converted into eerie sounds we won’t soon forget.\n\nA hook-wielding copter tries to catch a rocket in midair\n\nRocket Lab, a US-based company that launches out of New Zealand, is trying to figure out a way to recapture its rocket boosters as they tumble down toward Earth after launch. In 2022, the company made two attempts to deploy a helicopter with a hook attachment. The wild spectacle is all part of Rocket Lab’s plans to save money by recovering and reusing rocket parts after they vault satellites to space.\n\nThe first attempt in May appeared to go as planned when the helicopter snagged a booster. But the pilots made the decision to drop the rocket part due to safety concerns.\n\nOn the second attempt, the rocket never came into view, and pilots confirmed the booster wouldn’t be returning to the factory dry. In a tweet, the company reported there was a data loss issue during the rocket’s reentry.\n\n‘Open the pod bay doors, Hal’\n\nNASA flew its first virtual assistant on a moon mission with the space agency’s historic Artemis I flight — a version of Amazon’s Alexa.\n\nWhile not exactly reminiscent of HAL 9000, the antagonistic voice assistant in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the decision did spark plenty of facetious comparisons.\n\nThe Artemis I mission was uncrewed, but NASA’s ground control teams used the voice assistant, called Callisto, to control cabin lighting and play music during the journey. It did not have the ability to open or close doors, for the record.\n\nArtemis I was just a test mission, and NASA is still evaluating how the voice recognition system may be included on future missions.\n\nA Japanese billionaire and 8 artists plan a trip around the moon\n\nJapanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa picked eight passengers who he said will join him on a trip around the moon, powered by SpaceX’s yet-to-be-flown Starship spacecraft. The group includes American DJ Steve Aoki and popular space YouTuber Tim Dodd, better known as the Everyday Astronaut.\n\nThe mission, called Dear Moon, was first announced in 2018 with the intention of flying by 2023. Maezawa initially aimed to take a group of artists with him on a six-day trip around the moon but later announced he had expanded his definition of an “artist.” Instead, Maezawa announced in a video last year that he would be open to people from all walks of life as long as they viewed themselves as artists.\n\nSeparately, millionaire Dennis Tito — who became the first person to pay his way to the International Space Station in the early 2000s — made his own lunar travel plans with SpaceX.\n\n‘Alien’ pace debris found in Australia\n\nChunks of space debris were reportedly found on farmland in Australia’s Snowy Mountains, and NASA and authorities confirmed that the objects were likely scraps of hardware from a SpaceX Dragon capsule intentionally jettisoned as the spacecraft reentered Earth’s atmosphere in May 2021.\n\nLikely debris from SpaceX Crew-1 appears on a field in Dalgety, Australia, in July in an image from social media. Brad Tucker/Reuters\n\nIt’s common for space debris to fall to Earth. But it’s far less common for the objects to wind up on land since most space garbage is discarded in the ocean.\n\nStart-up looks to use centrifuge to fling satellites into space\n\nPerhaps among the most unique space start-ups in the world, SpinLaunch aims to whip satellites around in a vacuum-sealed chamber and toss them into space rather than put them on a rocket.\n\nThe company began testing a scaled-down version of its technology last year, but things ramped up in 2022. SpinLaunch notched its 10th test flight in October.\n\nThere’s a science fiction connection as well. SpinLaunch founder Jonathan Yaney cites the work of Jules Verne — the “Journey to the Center of Earth” writer who died more than 50 years before the first satellite traveled to space — as the inspiration for SpinLaunch.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the company’s technology will ever come to fruition. But in the meantime, this group will be in the New Mexico desert attempting to bring art to life.\n\nJeff Bezos’ joyride rocket explodes on uncrewed mission\n\nIf it wasn’t surreal enough watching Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos and other celebrities travel to space on his self-funded, suborbital rocket last year, hearing that the rocket exploded a little more than a year later over West Texas — albeit on a trip without any passengers — was a harrowing moment that brought home the adage “space is hard.” However, the crew capsule, which was carrying science projects and other inanimate payloads on September 12, was able to land successfully.\n\n“The capsule landed safely and the booster impacted within the designated hazard area,” the Federal Aviation Administration said in a September statement. Bezos’ Blue Origin has been in limbo since and has not returned to flight.\n\nAnd with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic still grounded, neither of the companies spearheading suborbital space tourism last year are conducting routine flights.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/world/milky-way-center-black-hole-image-scn/index.html", "title": "Supermassive black hole: 1st image of Sagittarius A* at the center of ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time, astronomers have captured an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nIt’s the first direct observation confirming the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.\n\nBlack holes don’t emit light, but the image shows the shadow of the black hole surrounded by a bright ring, which is light bent by the gravity of the black hole. Astronomers said the black hole is 4 million times more massive than our sun.\n\n“For decades, astronomers have wondered what lies at the heart of our galaxy, pulling stars into tight orbits through its immense gravity,” Michael Johnson, astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement.\n\n“With the (Event Horizon Telescope or EHT) image, we have zoomed in a thousand times closer than these orbits, where the gravity grows a million times stronger. At this close range, the black hole accelerates matter to close to the speed of light and bends the paths of photons in the warped (space-time).”\n\nThe black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth. Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy, which is why we’re so distant from the galactic center. If we could see this in our night sky, the black hole would appear to be the same size as a doughnut sitting on the moon.\n\nThe Gemini North telescope captured an image of a bright new supernova in the Pinwheel Galaxy. International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA The ring-like shell of the first recorded supernova was captured by the Dark Energy Camera on the Víctor M. Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The glowing debris marks where a white dwarf star exploded more than 1,800 years ago and was recorded by Chinese astronomers in the year 185. CTIO/NOIRLab/DOE/NSF/AURA This artist's illustration shows the large, puffy star Gaia17bpp being partially eclipsed by a dust cloud that surrounds its mysterious smaller companion star. Anastasios Tzanidakis An image of the Sh2-54 Nebula was taken in infrared light using the European Southern Observatory's VISTA telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile. ESO/VVVX The Gemini North telescope captured a pair of galaxies, NGC 4567 (top) and NGC 4568 (bottom), as they collide. Nicknamed the Butterfly galaxies, they will eventually merge as a single galaxy in 500 million years. International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA The Hubble Space Telescope captured a spectacular head-on view of the grand design spiral galaxy NGC 3631, located about 53 million light-years away. NASA; ESA; A. Filippenko; D. Sand This collection of 37 images from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken between 2003 and 2021, includes galaxies that are all hosts to both Cepheid variables and supernovae. They serve as cosmic tools to measure astronomical distance and refine the expansion rate of the universe. NASA/ESA/Adam G. Riess (STScI, JHU) This is the first image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope project. European Southern Observatory/EHT Collaboration Two galaxies, NGC 1512 and NGC 1510, appear to dance in this image from the Dark Energy Camera. The galaxies have been in the process of merging for 400 million years, which has ignited waves of star formation and warped both galaxies. NSF's NOIRLab/Dark Energy Survey This illustration shows exocomets orbiting the nearby star Beta Pictoris. Astronomers have detected at least 30 exocomets in the system, which also hosts two exoplanets. Calcada This artist's impression shows a two-star system, with a white dwarf (foreground) and a companion star (background), where a micronova explosion can occur. Although these stellar explosions are smaller than supernovae, they can be intensely powerful. Mark A. Garlick/European Southern Observatory This sequence of images shows how the solid nucleus (or the \"dirty snowball\" heart) of Comet C/2014 UN271 was isolated from a vast shell of dust and gas to measure it. Scientists believe the nucleus could be 85 miles across. NASA/ESA/Man-To Hui (MUST)/David Jewitt (UCLA) The Hubble Space Telescope has captured an image of the most distant star yet: Earendel, which is nearly 13 billion light-years away. NASA/ESA/Brian Welch (JHU)/Dan Coe (STScI)/Alyssa Pagan (STScI) Astronomers have imaged a space phenomena called odd radio circles using the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. These space rings are so massive that they measure about a million light-years across -- 16 times bigger than our Milky Way galaxy. Jayanne English (U. Manitoba) This illustration shows what happens when two large celestial bodies collide in space, creating a debris cloud. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope saw a debris cloud block the light of the star HD 166191. NASA/JPL-Caltech Some 4.4 million space objects billions of light-years away have been mapped by astronomers, including 1 million space objects that hadn't been spotted before. The observations were made by the sensitive Low Frequency Array telescope, known as LOFAR. Annalisa Bonafede An unusual triangle shape formed by two galaxies crashing together in a cosmic tug-of-war has been captured in a new image taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The head-on collision between the two galaxies fueled a star-forming frenzy, creating \"the oddball triangle of newly minted stars.\" J. Dalcanton/Space Telescope Science Institute/NASA This image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A combines some of the first X-ray data collected by NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, shown in magenta, with high-energy X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, in blue. NASA/CXC/SAO/IXPE This image shows the Milky Way as viewed from Earth. The star icon shows the position of a mysterious repeating transient. The spinning space object beamed out radiation three times per hour and became the brightest source of radio waves viewable from Earth, acting like a celestial lighthouse. Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker/ICRAR/Curtin This Hubble Space Telescope image shows the dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, which is filled with young stars. The bright center, surrounded by pink clouds, indicates the location of its black hole and areas of star birth.

Stanke/ESO This artist's impression showcases a red supergiant star in the final year of its life emitting a tumultuous cloud of gas, experiencing significant internal changes before exploding in a supernova. The Astrophysical Journal/Northwestern University Wonders of the universe Prev Next\n\n“We were stunned by how well the size of the ring agreed with predictions from Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity,” said EHT project scientist Geoffrey Bower from the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, in a statement.\n\n“These unprecedented observations have greatly improved our understanding of what happens at the very (center) of our galaxy, and offer new insights on how these giant black holes interact with their surroundings.”\n\nThe results of this groundbreaking discovery were published Thursday in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nSearching for the black hole\n\nIt has taken five years for astronomers to capture and confirm this image and discovery. Previously, scientists observed stars orbiting some invisible, massive object at the galactic center.\n\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to scientists Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez for their discoveries about black holes, including evidence shared by Ghez and Genzel about the mass of the object at the center of the Milky Way.\n\n“We now see that the black hole is swallowing the nearby gas and light, pulling them into a bottomless pit,” Ramesh Narayan, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement. “This image confirms decades of theoretical work to understand how black holes eat.”\n\nThe discovery was made possible by more than 300 researchers from 80 institutions working with a network of eight different radio telescopes around the globe that make up the Event Horizon Telescope.\n\nThe telescope is named after the “event horizon,” the point at which no light can escape from a black hole. This global telescope network essentially forms a single “Earth-size” virtual telescope when all eight are linked and observing in tandem.\n\nIt’s the second image ever captured of a black hole, with the first being the EHT’s achievement of imaging M87* at the heart of the distant Messier 87 galaxy, located 55 million light-years away, in 2019.\n\nThese panels show the first two black hole images. On the left is M87*, and the right is Sagittarius A*. European Southern Observatory/EHT Collaboration\n\nWhile the two images look similar, Sagittarius A* is more than 1,000 times smaller than M87*.\n\n“We have two completely different types of galaxies and two very different black hole masses, but close to the edge of these black holes they look amazingly similar,” said Sera Markoff, cochair of the EHT Science Council and a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, in a statement.\n\n“This tells us that (Einstein’s theory of) General Relativity governs these objects up close, and any differences we see further away must be due to differences in the material that surrounds the black holes.”\n\nCapturing an impossible image\n\nAlthough the Milky Way’s black hole is closer to Earth, it was much harder to image.\n\n“The gas in the vicinity of the black holes moves at the same speed – nearly as fast as light – around both Sgr A* and M87*,” EHT scientist Chi-kwan Chan at the Steward Observatory and Department of Astronomy and the Data Science Institute of the University of Arizona, said in a statement.\n\n“But where gas takes days to weeks to orbit the larger M87*, in the much smaller Sgr A* it completes an orbit in mere minutes. This means the brightness and pattern of the gas around Sgr A* was changing rapidly as the EHT Collaboration was observing it – a bit like trying to take a clear picture of a puppy quickly chasing its tail.”\n\nIf the supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A* were next to each other, Sagittarius A* would be dwarfed by M87*, which is over 1,000 times more massive. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nThe global network of astronomers had to develop new tools to allow for the quick movement of gas around Sagittarius A*. The resulting image is an average of different ones taken by the team. Taking the Sagittarius A* image was like capturing a photo of a grain of salt in New York City using a camera in Los Angeles, according to California Institute of Technology researchers.\n\n“This image from the Event Horizon Telescope required more than just snapping a picture from telescopes on high mountaintops. It is the product of both technically challenging telescope observations and innovative computational algorithms,” Katherine Bouman, Rosenberg scholar and assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences, electrical engineering and astronomy at the Caltech, said during a press conference.\n\nBouman also worked on capturing the M87* image shared in 2019. Despite the fact that the Sagittarius A* image may seem blurry, “it’s one of the sharpest images ever made,” Bouman said.\n\nEach telescope was pushed to its limit, which is called a diffraction limit, or the maximum fine features that it can see.\n\n“And that’s basically the level that we’re seeing here,” Johnson said at the press conference. “It’s fuzzy because to make a sharper image, we need to move our telescopes further apart or go into higher frequencies.”\n\nOn the horizon\n\nHaving images of two very different black holes will allow astronomers to determine their similarities and differences and better understand how gas behaves around supermassive black holes, which could contribute to the formation and evolution of galaxies. It is believed that black holes exist at the center of most galaxies, acting like an engine that powers them.\n\nSagittarius A* is at the center of our own galaxy, while M87* resides more than 55 million light-years from Earth. National Science Foundation/Keyi \"Onyx\" Li\n\nMeanwhile, the EHT team is working to expand the telescope network and conduct upgrades that could lead to even more stunning images, and even movies, of black holes in the future.\n\nCapturing a black hole in motion can show how it changes over time and what the gas does as it swirls around a black hole. Bouman and EHT member Antonio Fuentes, who will join Caltech as a postdoctoral researcher in October, are developing methods that will allow them to stitch images of the black hole together to reflect this motion.\n\nThis “first direct image of the gentle giant in the center of our galaxy” is just the beginning, said Feryal Özel, member of the EHT Science Council and a professor of astronomy and physics and associate dean for research at the University of Arizona, during the press conference.\n\n“This image is a testament to what we can accomplish, when as a global research community, we bring our brightest minds together to make the seemingly impossible, possible,” National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement. “Language, continents and even the galaxy can’t stand in the way of what humanity can accomplish when we come together for the greater good of all.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}]}
