The White House Office of Management and Budget said in a recent email that workers whose activities are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” are a target, and Vice President JD Vance told reporters that the administration will \"have to lay people off\" if a shutdown extends for weeks.\n\nThe shutdown blame game also is ratcheting up. The White House website features a clock counting the amount of time \"Democrats have shut down the government,\" while the Democratic National Committee wrote on social media early Wednesday that \"Republicans own this shutdown.\"\n\nKeep up with live coverage across the USA TODAY Network.\n\nMass federal layoffs will begin in 'a day or two,' budget chief says\n\nRuss Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told House Republicans in a private call Wednesday that mass layoffs of federal workers will begin in \"a day or two,\" according to a lawmaker on the call.\n\nVought's timeline for so-called \"reductions in force\" of federal workers comes as President Donald Trump has warned Democrats that he could choose to eliminate “vast numbers\" of federal workers under a government shutdown, which started Wednesday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during a briefing with reporters, did not elaborate on which federal departments could be affected but said layoffs are \"imminent.”\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nStatue of Liberty may go dark, New York governor warns\n\nThe Statue of Liberty may go dark during the federal government shutdown, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Wednesday.\n\nWith Lady Liberty as a backdrop, the New York Democrat stood alongside state elected officials and union representatives to call out Republicans in Washington, D.C., for the shutdown’s effects on entitlement programs, as well as closures to services and parks. This may include Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, the historic entry to the United States for millions of people who became Americans. Lady Liberty, dedicated nearly 140 years ago in New York Harbor, has symbolized the country’s embrace of immigrants.\n\nHochul said New York wouldn’t pay to keep the Statue of Liberty open during Washington's budget fight as the state had done before.\n\n“Today, the torch she holds — as a beacon to others, a symbol — could literally go dark,” Hochul said. “Not because of an act of God or a horrific storm, flood or hurricane. But literally because Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington forced a government shutdown.”\n\nNeither the National Park Service nor the Department of Interior immediately responded to emailed questions about keeping Liberty and Ellis islands open.\n\nDuring previous government shutdowns, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo used state funds to keep the Statue of Liberty open. The federal shutdown in 2018-19 cost about $1.5 million to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, Gothamist reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\n- Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhy are lawmakers fighting over health care?\n\nRepublicans are claiming Democrats shut down the government to demand free health care for undocumented immigrants. But these migrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, said Leo Cuello, a professor at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nThey don't qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, Medicare or the Children's Health Insurance Program. And they can't purchase federally subsidized health plans on exchanges backed by the Affordable Care Act. There are legal immigrants on Medicaid in the United States, so-called \"qualified aliens\" who were previously eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, they included only lawful immigrants: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum, people granted humanitarian parole including Ukrainians and Afghans, certain Cubans and Haitians; and certain victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, among others.\n\nThe new tax and spending law Trump signed in July restricts eligibility only to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents – i.e. green card holders – as well as some Cuban and Haitian immigrants.\n\nThere is no proposal to provide free health care to people living in the country illegally.\n\n– Lauren Villagran and Sarah Wire\n\nShutdown stalls case against ICE in Chicago\n\nThe shutdown has also stalled a case against the Department of Homeland Security over the agency’s immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz.\n\nThe National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed documents in federal court over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in the Chicago area. The arrests violated a settlement agreement with ICE dating back to 2022 that barred many vehicle stops and arrests made without a warrant, according to defense attorneys.\n\nA spokesperson for the Northern District of Illinois federal court confirmed that a hearing set for Oct. 3 over potential violations to the Castañon Nava consent decree was delayed following the shutdown.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, urged the court to take up the case again: \"We urgently need the court to weigh in to hold the Trump administration accountable for its ongoing immigration raids in the Chicago area, where federal agents are detaining people, including children, without warrants or probable cause, and using increasingly violent tactics to do so.\"\n\nThe case comes as parts of the region say that Trump’s Midway Blitz amounts to a siege and as Illinois leaders fear masked federal agents will spark protests the White House will use the National Guard to quell.\n\nJeffries says Trump behaving 'erratically,' hits back over sombrero videos\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he had not heard from the White House since congressional leaders left the property after a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nJeffries said Trump, who has been posting AI-generated videos of the Democratic leader in a mustache and sombrero, has been behaving \"somewhat erratically\" since the meeting and does not seem to be interested in coming up with a resolution to the government shutdown that began on Wednesday.\n\n\"It would seem to me that as the president of the United States, on the brink of a government shutdown, if you actually wanted to bring everyone together to try to get to a resolution in a common-sense, bipartisan way, that's not the type of behavior that we would see,\" Jeffries said on The Lead with Jake Tapper on CNN.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters at the White House earlier in the day that Trump was \"joking\" when he shared the memes that Jeffries and others have criticized as racist.\n\nBut Jeffries said he did not want to dwell on the videos. \"The broader problem is it's deeply unserious, and this is a serious moment. We need to reopen the government,\" Jeffries told CNN.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nFirst DOGE. Now shutdown. Federal workers see tough year.\n\nIt’s been a tough year to be a federal worker.\n\nPotential widespread layoffs under the government shutdown are just the latest in a tough year for federal workers that’s already seen over 200,000 civil servants leave the workforce, according to the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nEarly cuts to the federal workforce came at the hands of Elon Musk’s \"U.S. Department of Government Efficiency”, a project Trump established on Jan. 20 to reduce spending and eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity” in the federal bureaucracy. Among those who left were 150,000 federal workers who took the White House’s \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, provided early in the Trump administration.\n\nBut some are pushing back. In response to potential layoffs under the shutdown, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees on Sept. 30 filed a lawsuit challenging the administration’s threats of a mass firing saying it was designed to “inflict punishment on, and further traumatize, federal employees throughout the nation.”\n\nThese actions are a “cynical use of federal employees as a pawn in Congressional deliberations should be declared unlawful and enjoined by this Court,” the lawsuit said.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nFederal spending cuts to Democratic states\n\nFor the second time today, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced a cut to federal funding to Democratic led states.\n\nOn social media Vought said that he would cancel funding for green energy projects in 16 Democrat-led states.\n\n\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,\" Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a social media post.\n\nHe said the cuts would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nEarlier in the day Vought announced that $18 million for two of New York city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — were on hold.\n\nWashington's Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriation's Committee, decried the \"mafioso tactics.\"\n\n\"We're less than a day into this shutdown, and Trump & Vought are illegally punishing Democrat-led states,\" Murray said on social media.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhite House plays AI videos of Jeffries in sombrero\n\nPresident Donald Trump is doubling down on his portrayal of House Democratic Leader of Hakeem Jeffries in a fake mustache and sombrero.\n\nOn the first day of a government shutdown, the White House on Tuesday afternoon started playing the controversial AI-generated videos featuring Jefferies in a mustache and sombrero on loop in the press briefing room.\n\nVice President JD Vance earlier in the day brushed off criticism from Jeffries and other Democrats who have called the videos racist. The videos, which are playing on a pair of large television screens in the briefing room, also include made up audio of Schumer making derogatory comments about immigrants, as mariachi music played in the background.\n\n“The president's joking,” Vance said when asked about the videos. “And we're having a good time.”\n\nThe vice president added: “Hakeem Jeffries said it was racist, and I know that he said that, and I honestly don’t even know what that means. Like, is he a Mexican-American that is offended by having a sombrero meme?”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for student loans? What about FAFSA?\n\nIn the event of a government shutdown, borrowers would still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt.\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to disburse Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans, according to the department’s contingency plan. As available, permanent and multi-year appropriations will also be used to continue processing Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, the plan said.\n\nDuring a lapse in funding, the department would cease any new grantmaking activities; however, grant programs typically make awards over the summer.\n\nBorrowers with a question or dispute related to their loan may have a tougher time reaching the department, as it plans to furlough the majority of its staff.\n\nExperts say while most borrowers won’t “feel” a short shutdown, more issues could arise the longer it takes those in Washington to make a deal.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nFederal agency websites blame Democrats for shutdown\n\nThe websites of several Cabinet-level agencies now have banners blaming Democrats for the government shutdown rather than the routine language noting that a “lapse in funding” has occurred and response times might be slower.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was the first to take a political approach, putting up its banner Tuesday.\n\nThe USDA’s website blames “Radical Left Democrat shutdown” for the page not being updated.\n\nThe DHS website says “Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”\n\nThe Justice Department claims “Democrats have shut down the government.”\n\n“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume,” the State Department’s site says.\n\nThe Treasury Department states “The radical left has chosen to shut down the United States government in the name of reckless spending and obstructionism.”\n\nSeveral agencies including the Education, Labor and Transportation departments simply refer to a lapse in funding.\n\n- Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat does it mean to be furloughed?\n\nA furlough is the \"placing of an employee in a temporary nonduty, non-pay status because of lack of work or funds, or other non-disciplinary reasons,\" according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nWhen an agency does not have enough funds, such as in the case of a government shutdown, a “shutdown” furlough occurs and those employees not categorized as \"excepted,\" or essential, pause their work.\n\nTSA warns of possible delays\n\nTravelers heading to the airport don’t need to worry about TSA disruptions from the government shutdown – at least for now.\n\nThe agency said on X that about 61,000 of its 64,000 employees are considered essential and will continue screening passengers, though their paychecks may be delayed until funding resumes. TSA warned that an extended shutdown could eventually lead to longer wait times, with past shutdowns showing rising absences among TSA and FAA employees can snarl air travel.\n\nFor now, flights and security operations are expected to run normally, but travelers should monitor flight status and security line updates if the shutdown continues.\n\n– Zach Wichter\n\nMillions of Medicare recipients could lose access to telehealth, in-home care\n\nSeniors who rely on Medicare could face major changes and new barriers to receiving medical care during the shutdown. Two COVID-era programs that expanded access to healthcare expired on Tuesday, despite having largely bipartisan support: One provided greater flexibility around telehealth and another allowed hospitals to continue high-level care at home.\n\nAs part of the shutdown, Congress missed the deadline on extending telehealth programs for Medicare beneficiaries, meaning previous restrictions will go back into place.\n\nTherefore, patients can no longer receive telehealth from home unless they meet specific criteria. Telehealth flexibility will again be limited to rural areas; audio-only visits will no longer be reimbursed for most services; and physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and audiologists will be excluded from telehealth reimbursement.\n\n– Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nYes, Congress and the president receive salaries during a government shutdown\n\nCongressional lawmakers and the president continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown under Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution.\n\n“The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States,\" the Constitution states.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers such as New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, say they will not take compensation during the shutdown. Trump also receives a salary as president, but the one-time real estate mogul has historically donated his pay.\n\nWill there be layoffs during the government shutdown? OMB director huddles with GOP lawmakers\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought would brief House Republican lawmakers Wednesday about federal government layoffs planned under the shutdown.\n\nTrump has warned “vast” layoffs are possible. Leavitt confirmed a time frame that layoffs are “imminent” and could begin in as little as two days.\n\n“We have to put a plan in place,” Leavitt told reporters.\n\nIs the DMV impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nNo. It's business as usual at Department of Motor Vehicles offices across the country. Like the U.S. Postal Service, the agency's operations are not contingent on Congress passing a funding package.\n\nMotor vehicle departments, which are state-run agencies, are largely funded through state budgets and supplemented by fees charged to drivers.\n\n– Amaris Encinas\n\nVance takes center stage in shutdown fight\n\nVance made a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing on Wednesday, placing himself at the forefront of the administration's fight with Democrats over government spending.\n\nIn remarks to reporters, Vance repeatedly blasted Schumer, who he accused of acting in his own political interests, and threatened mass layoffs for federal workers if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"We need to reopen the government,\" Vance said. \"Let's fix America's problems, let's work together to solve them, but let's reopen the government before have our negotiation about healthcare policy.\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat government services will be impacted by shutdown?\n\nSocial Security checks will still be delivered. Medicare and Medicaid benefits also will still be paid, but many other aspects of the federal government will grind to a halt during the shutdown.\n\nAll federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working during a shutdown.\n\nEssential services include the U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services and air-traffic control. \"Nonessential\" work, however, must pause, which affects thousands of federal employees and millions of Americans.\n\nDo you have Medicare or Medicaid? Your doctor will see you, for now\n\nIf you have Medicare or Medicaid, you should be able to see your doctor without disruption. But if the shutdown drags on several weeks, problems could surface, experts said.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will continue operations during the shutdown.\n\nDoctors, hospitals and other health providers could see delays in Medicare and Medicaid payments during a longer-term shutdown, said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nDoctors might be reluctant to schedule appointments for new or existing patients if their payments are delayed, Burks said. Federal law requires hospitals to assess and stabilize anyone who seeks care at an emergency room.\n\n– Ken Alltucker\n\nTrump is no stranger to shutdowns\n\nA shuttered government is familiar territory for Trump, whose first term saw three shutdowns, including a 35-day closure spanning the end of 2018 into early 2019. It remains the longest in U.S. history.\n\nWhen Congress failed to pass new spending authority Tuesday, it prompted the 4th shutdown of the federal government during a Trump presidency.\n\nWhen will the government reopen? Here's what would need to happen\n\nThe government will remain shut down until Congress can agree on federal funding allocations.\n\nTo reopen the government, Congress will need to pass funding appropriations. Trump will then have to sign the appropriations bill into law.\n\nLawmakers could also pass a temporary spending bill, known as a continuing resolution (or CR, for short), to buy more time for negotiations.\n\nStocks little changed on shutdown’s first day\n\nU.S. stocks were mixed in the late morning in New York as investors digested the first day of the government shutdown and a weaker-than-expected report about hiring.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 66 points, about 0.1%, to trade near 46,464, while the broader S&P 500 index was down 2 points near 6,687. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 25 points, or 0.1%, trading near 22,635. Gold, which investors snatch up during periods of uncertainty, was up $22 near $3,895.\n\nBefore the market opened, payroll processor ADP said that private employers had shed a net 32,000 jobs in September. Economists had expected a gain of 50,000 jobs. ADP’s report will likely be the only read on the state of hiring until the shutdown ends, and with the Federal Reserve set to meet during the last week of October, it takes on outsize importance.\n\nThe lackluster reading “makes the Fed more likely to cut rates a quarter percent at their next decision in late October,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Dallas-based Comerica Bank, in an email.\n\nHow is the IRS impacted by the government shutdown?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will not immediately be impacted by the government shutdown. More than 74,000 IRS employees are expected to report to work for the first day days after the shutdown's start, per the IRS' government shutdown contingency plan.\n\nThe federal government agency will continue operating under the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides supplemental appropriations to the IRS through Sept. 30, 2031, according to the contingency plan. However, the plan does not outline the agency's next steps after Oct. 5.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nAOC: ‘This is so not about me’\n\nProgressive firebrand New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday that Republicans who are speculating the government shutdown is her fault should negotiate with her on a deal directly.\n\nHer remarks come as some Republicans have argued that Schumer opposed a temporary short-term bill to fund the government because of pressure from progressive Democrats and a potential primary challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in 2028.\n\nSchumer received backlash in March after voting in favor of a Republican-crafted short-term funding bill. Ocasio-Cortez told reporters then that there was \"a deep sense of outrage and betrayal\" and said Senate Democrats must \"correct course.\" Other House Democrats and New York politicos urged her to mount a primary challenge to him when he is next up for re-election in 2028.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez said just hours before the government shut down that, “This is so not about me in this moment.”\n\nShe added, “I saw some senators speculating about this, and I saw some Republican members of Congress saying, ‘Oh, well, if we have this shutdown, it's because of AOC.’ Well, if that's the case, my office is open and you are free to walk in and negotiate with me directly.”\n\nSchumer shutdown becomes key phrase for congressional Republicans\n\nCongressional Republicans adopted two key phrases at a Wednesday news conference to accuse Democrats of holding the American public “hostage” and blast what they called the “Schumer shutdown.”\n\nSchumer of New York has become the face of the Democratic Party as he negotiates federal funding with Trump. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, each called it a “Schumer shutdown.”\n\n“The reason the government is shut down this morning is because the Democrats decided they would rather hold our government hostage and issue a $1.5 trillion random note,” said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota.\n\nSchumer has highlighted that many people will lose health insurance if federal subsidies aren’t extended under Obamacare as the renewal period begins Nov. 1.\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said subsidies could be debated in December before new insurance rates go into effect Jan. 1.\n\n“That is not a decision that has to be made before the end of the year,” Johnson said. “Don’t buy it. They’re grasping at straws.”\n\nMike Johnson says shutdown ‘opportunity to downsize’ government\n\nJohnson told Fox Business that he has spoken to Trump about using the shutdown to cut the federal government.\n\n“The president and I have talked about this at great length,” Johnson said Wednesday. “While a shutdown is very damaging for real American people who depend on government services, it can provide an opportunity to downsize the scope and the scale of government, which is something that we’ve all always wanted to do.”\n\nTrump is threatening mass layoffs of federal workers. Johnson said the shutdown is an opportunity to do things “we would not otherwise be able to do because we would never get Democrat votes for them.”\n\n‘No way out’: Congressional Republicans push for short-term funding\n\nRepublican congressional leaders urged Democrats to support a short-term extension of funding through Nov. 21 and reopen the government while lawmakers continue to debate spending levels.\n\n“There’s no way out,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said at a Wednesday news conference outside the Capitol. “Everybody’s asking the question how does this end.”\n\nThe House previously approved the short-term funding extension. Another Senate vote is expected about 11 a.m. on Wednesday. But a 55-45 vote on Tuesday fell short of the 60 votes needed to approve the bill.\n\n“They have taken the American people hostage,” Thune said of Democrats. “This could all end today.”\n\nDoes the military still operate during a government shutdown?\n\nMilitary operations are necessary to national security, so service members will continue to work during the shutdown, according to a Saturday contingency plan published by the Department of War.\n\nHowever, military members won't get paid while working during the shutdown because their compensation is funded through annual personnel appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security and Department of War, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nIt's possible that Congress will act to ensure active duty members continue to get paid as they have in past shutdowns. For example, the Pay Our Military Act allowed military members to be paid during a government shutdown in 2013.\n\nNational Park site operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nNational Park operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nIn general parks will remain open and “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to newly published contingency plans on the Department of Interior’s website.\n\nParks with accessible areas that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are to use balances from those fees to continue providing basic visitor services like restroom maintenance and trash collection.\n\nHowever, the plan says the National Park Service will not operate nor offer visitor services in parks without accessible areas, though essential services like law enforcement and border safety will continue. Also facilities and areas that are typically locked or secured after business hours will largely remain so during the shutdown.\n\n– Eve Chen\n\n'There’s going to be some pain' Vance says shutdown could hurt.\n\nVance in a Wednesday appearance on CBS Mornings said Americans could be harmed by the shutdown’s impact on government services.\n\n“There are critical, essential services that the people rely on that are going to suffer because of this,” Vance said, adding: “There’s going to be some pain.”\n\nVance also appeared on Fox News, where he criticized Democrats’ focus on including an extension of health care subsidies in any government funding bill, saying “you don’t shut down the government because you have a policy disagreement about a totally separate issue.”\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders – Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York – issued a joint statement at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday saying Trump and Republicans shut down the government “because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people.”\n\nWill a government shutdown impact my flight?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work.\n\nHowever, a group representing major U.S. airlines warned that a partial federal government shutdown could strain American aviation and slow flights, as air traffic controllers and security officers would be forced to work without pay and other functions would be halted.\n\nAirline trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned that if funding lapses \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency\" and impacting travelers.\n\n– Kathleen Wong\n\nAbout $18 billion in NYC infrastructure funds frozen amid shutdown\n\nThe Trump administration has frozen about $18 billion in infrastructure project funds to New York City amid the federal government shutdown. Federal officials on Wednesday alleged discrimination from a city program meant to help underrepresented groups obtain federal contracts.\n\nThe federal Department of Transportation said two of the city’s largest projects in decades — the 2nd Avenue subway expansion and the Hudson River rail tunnel — are on hold pending administrative review. An agency news release called the projects “arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nIn an X post, Russ Vought, the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, said the hold is meant to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”\n\nThe Transportation Department cited the city’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation in federally assisted contracts. Projects, for now, can’t reimbursed, an agency news release said.\n\nA spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Gov. Kathy Hochul, a New York Democrat, called the hold “political payback and an attack on New York and its residents.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nSmithsonian museums remaining open this week\n\nThe Smithsonian Institute’s museums, research centers, and the National Zoo remain open this week despite the government shutdown.\n\nThe organization posted on its website that it will use money from the last fiscal year’s budget to stay open at least through Monday, Oct. 6.\n\nThe Smithsonian has 17 museums and a zoo in the Washington area plus two museums in New York City.\n\nWhat does the government shutdown mean for mortgage borrowers?\n\nAmericans who are hoping to close on a mortgage soon – whether for a purchase or a refinance – may experience some delays as government functions are curtailed. Here are a few things to know:\n\nMost mortgages that will be assumed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be unaffected, industry participants say. However, if your Social Security number needs to be verified, you may encounter delays.\n\nIf your mortgage comes from a rural housing program like those from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, expect delays. As the National Association of Realtors explains in an online memo to members, “new direct and guaranteed home loans, and any scheduled direct‑loan closings will be postponed. Pending conditional commitments for guaranteed loans are still being reviewed.”\n\nIf your mortgage comes from the Department of Veterans Affairs, you should also expect delays. “Some VA staff and support functions may be reduced, which may slow down approvals, appraisals and certificate of eligibility requests,” NAR says.\n\nIf you are working with a housing counselor affiliated with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, that agency may need to scale back or halt their activities, NAR says.\n\nBuyers in flood-prone areas like Florida and Louisiana might encounter delays because the National Flood Insurance Program will not be funded. Some lenders may allow the purchase to proceed anyway, but that can create problems if a storm happens before insurance can be written, said Jeff Lichtenstein, president and broker of Echo Fine Properties in south Florida.\n\n“Uncertainty in the marketplace might have some buyers just wanting to back out,” Lichtenstein told USA TODAY in an email. “Nothing good ever comes out of these things.”\n\nWhite House website features shutdown clock\n\nTrump is doing everything he can to blame Democrats for the shutdown, including featuring a shutdown clock on the White House website.\n\nThe top of the website displays the amount of time since “Democrats have shutdown the government.” There’s also a link to a video with clips of Democrats criticizing past shutdowns.\n\nThe Trump administration has used other government channels to blast out highly partisan shutdown messages, including a banner on the Department of Housing and Urban Development website declaring the “radical left” is shutting down the government.\n\nDemocrats say blame for the shutdown lies with the GOP.\n\n“Republicans own this shutdown,” the Democratic National Committee posted on social media early Wednesday.\n\nMassive furloughs expected in federal government\n\nAbout 750,000 federal employees ranging from workers at national parks to financial regulators could be furloughed each day under a shutdown, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, withholding about $400 million in daily compensation.\n\nOther workers in government services that are considered “essential,” such as the military and law enforcement, will continue to work but won’t be paid until a deal is reached.\n\nTrump warns of government layoffs\n\nTrump has also warned Democrats he may lay off federal workers under a shutdown. \"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them ‒ cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things they that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump said in the Oval Office, hours before the shutdown.\n\nThe president later said: “A lot of good can come down from shutdowns. We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want. They’d be Democrat things.”\n\nThe shutdown is the first since 2019, which came during Trump’s first term following Democratic objections over funding Trump’s border wall. It was also the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 35 days, costing the U.S. economy about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nDemocrats hold out for health-care demands\n\nDemocrats have demanded the reversal of Medicaid cuts that Republicans passed this year and the extension of health care subsidies be included in a funding measure.\n\n“He doesn't understand that if the government shuts down, people's healthcare premiums will go up,” Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said of Trump from the Senate Floor on Tuesday.\n\nTrump and Republicans have countered by accusing Democrats of wanting to provide health care for immigrants who are in the country illegally. “That’s what they’re insisting, and obviously, I have an obligation to not accept that,” Trump said. Democrats have called the president's claims a lie, noting that undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible for payments from Medicare, Medicaid, or the Affordable Care Act.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-impact-flight-cruise-national-parks/86454565007/", "title": "Will the government shutdown affect my trip?

Are airports open during a shutdown?\n\nFlights should still be able to continue during a partial government shutdown since Transportation Security Administration workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, those who give flight clearance and verify travelers’ identities at border control are deemed essential and are still required to work.\n\nHowever, the trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency.\"\n\nDuring the last government shutdown in 2019, the number of absences by air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers rose as workers missed paychecks, extending waits at some airports.\n\nAre trains working during a government shutdown?\n\nAmtrak trains will continue operating normally in the shutdown.\n\n\"Passengers planning to travel on Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor and across the country in the coming days and weeks can be assured that Amtrak will remain open for business,\" Amtrak said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nWhile Amtrak receives federal grants, it also earns ticket revenue, so it has the money to keep going. However, the Rail Passengers Association notes, if a shutdown goes on long enough, operations could be strained.\n\nWill cruise ports still work during a government shutdown?\n\nThe government shutdown shouldn’t directly impact cruise sailings.\n\n\"As far as the impact on cruises, essential federal personnel – including the U.S. Coast Guard, TSA, and CBP agents – will continue to report to work, so core port and security functions will remain in place,\" the cruise industry’s leading trade group Cruise Lines International Association told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, CLIA says some experiences offered at U.S. destinations, like national park visits, may be impacted.\n\nAre national parks open during a government shutdown?\n\nNational Park operations will vary during the government shutdown.\n\nIn general parks will remain open and “park roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors,” according to newly published contingency plans on the Department of Interior’s website.\n\nParks with accessible areas that collect fees under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are to use balances from those fees to continue providing basic visitor services like restroom maintenance, trash collection and campground operation.\n\nHowever, the plan says the National Park Service will not operate nor offer visitor services in parks without accessible areas, though essential services like law enforcement and border safety will continue. Also facilities and areas that are typically locked or secured after business hours will largely remain so during the shutdown.\n\nContributing: Kathleen Wong, Nathan Diller, USA TODAY; Reuters\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/09/30/government-shutdown-flight-airports/86371001007/", "title": "Will a government shutdown delay your flight?

Here's what air passengers should know.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nWill a government shutdown impact my flight?\n\nFor the most part, no. Air passengers should still be able to continue with their flights during a partial government shutdown.\n\nThose workers who screen at airport security checkpoints, give flight clearance, and verify at border control are deemed essential, so they are still required to work. Instead, a shutdown puts federal funding on hold for agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration, and Customs and Border Protection. As a result, actions like hiring or training are put on hold, and workers aren't paid until the issue is resolved.\n\nHowever, you may encounter longer lines and wait times, so plan accordingly. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure the security of our transportation systems, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" a TSA spokesperson told USA TODAY in December when a previous shutdown loomed. In 2019, FAA controllers and TSA agents stopped showing up for work, causing flight delays and long lines.\n\n\"Our expectation and history shows that air travel continues to be safe, but history also shows that when workers, whether it's air traffic controllers or Transportation Security officers, have to continually show up for work without pay, it adds additional stress,\" Hansen said.\n\nHe recommended people stay informed on any updates from their airport and airline, so their travels can run smoothly.\n\nA group representing major U.S. airlines warned on Monday that a partial federal government shutdown could strain American aviation and slow flights, as air traffic controllers and security officers would be forced to work without pay and other functions would be halted.\n\nAirline trade group Airlines for America, which represents United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others, warned that if funding lapses \"the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency\" and impacting travelers.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/25/government-shutdown-2025-open-closed/86347920007/", "title": "What's open or closed in a federal government shutdown? Here are ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − As President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats clash over government spending, a partial government shutdown looms Oct. 1.\n\nPartisan spending disputes occasionally shut down parts of the government for a few days or a few weeks. Traditionally, \"essential\" workers such as military troops or air-traffic controllers are exempt from a shutdown, while visitors to national parks notice custodial workers are \"nonessential\" and trash piles up.\n\nThe stakes are higher for federal workers because the White House is considering layoffs rather than temporary furloughs. In past shutdowns, workers were paid back for their time off when the funding dispute was resolved, but it's not clear that will happen this time.\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet on Sept. 29 at the White House with the four top GOP and Democratic leaders in Congress as the deadline approaches. Here's what to know about the potential shutdown:\n\nWhat will be affected by the shutdown?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, all federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working.\n\nEssential services include the U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security services and air-traffic control.\n\n\"Nonessential\" work, however, must pause, which affects thousands of federal employees and millions of Americans. National parks closed during past shutdowns or were kept open with state help – but with fewer services like trash pickup.\n\nWill Social Security checks go out?\n\nThe Social Security Administration is projected to pay out $1.6 trillion to 72 million beneficiaries this year, making it a vital economic lifeline for much of the country.\n\nA shutdown won’t disrupt those payments.\n\nSocial Security is a mandatory spending program that is not subject to annual appropriations. However, staffing and some services could be impacted if they have a discretionary spending component, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonprofit that studies federal fiscal policy.\n\nWhat happens to Medicare and Medicaid during a shutdown?\n\nThe federal Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs also are considered mandatory spending, meaning benefits won’t be impacted if the government shuts down.\n\nNearly 71 million people were enrolled in Medicaid for lower-income families and the disabled as of May 2025. And 69 million enrolled in Medicare for the elderly.\n\nWill national parks close in a shutdown?\n\nNational parks could be significantly impacted by a shutdown. Park funding is appropriated by Congress, leaving the park system vulnerable if lawmakers can’t reach a deal.\n\nDuring the 35-day shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019, some national parks closed completely. Many stayed open, some with help from state governments, but \"no visitor services were provided, and damage and trash buildup were reported at many sites,\" according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nA contingency plan created by the National Park Service for a potential 2023 shutdown stated: \"In general, National Park Service sites will be closed during the period of a lapse in appropriations. This means that the majority of National Park sites will be closed completely to public access.\"\n\nWill federal workers get paid?\n\nTraditionally, federal workers get paid after being furloughed temporarily for shutdowns. But the Office of Management and Budget asked federal agencies on Sept. 24 to draft plans for permanent layoffs.\n\n\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown,\" the memo said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the threat was meant to scare workers.\n\nIs airline travel through FAA and TSA affected by a shutdown?\n\nAir travel continues during a shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control system and the Transportation Security Administration are considered essential.\n\nBut workers don't get paid during the shutdown, which can lead to delays when workers don't show up for shifts. Geoff Freeman, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said an estimated $1 billion per week is lost to the travel economy due to disruptions in air and rail travel, and closures of parks and museums.\n\n\"The consequences of inaction are immediate and severe,\" Freeman said in a letter Sept. 25 to congressional leaders.\n\nDuring the shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019, some TSA checkpoints were closed and travelers faced longer lines when agents didn't report to work, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The absence of 10 controllers temporarily halted flights at New York's LaGuardia airport and caused delays at others.\n\nWhat happens to food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program during a shutdown?\n\nSNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, also are considered mandatory spending but can be impacted by shutdowns.\n\nThe continuing resolutions – bills that continue government funding at current levels − that have been used to fund the government generally only allow the Agriculture Department to send out SNAP benefits \"for 30 days after a shutdown begins,\" according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.\n\n\"During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the USDA paid February SNAP benefits early on January 20, just before the 30-day window ended, but it would have been unable to pay March benefits had the shutdown continued,\" the group said.\n\nHow long could the shutdown last?\n\nThe federal government has partially closed down 21 times for a total of 162 days since 1977. That's an average of nearly eight days per shutdown.\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted 35 days. Spanning from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019, it is also the most recent federal shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\nThe second longest government shutdown occurred during the Clinton administration. It lasted 21 days from Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/09/29/social-security-payment-government-shutdown/86419409007/", "title": "Will I get my Social Security payment if the government shuts down?", "text": "With less than 48 hours until a potential partial government shutdown, Congress and the White House continue to spar over whether to keep the government open or let health benefits expire for approximately 24 million Americans who receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCongress has until the end of the day on Sept. 30 to avoid a partial shutdown, which will take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1 if a last-minute agreement is not reached. In the event of a shutdown, many federal agencies and services are shut down or significantly restricted, impacting everyday people who rely on programs like Social Security.\n\nSocial Security does get funding from the government, but not in the same way as national parks or the military. Because of this, existing beneficiaries will feel the impact of the shutdown differently from Americans who don’t already receive Social Security payments.\n\nHere’s what to know about Social Security payments during a government shutdown.\n\nWhen could a government shutdown happen?\n\nThe current funding for the government expires at midnight on Sept. 30, with Oct. 1 being the potential start of a partial government shutdown.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nSince 1981, there have been 14 partial government shutdowns, with most lasting only a day or two, according to Reuters. One of the most recent shutdowns was also one of the longest, lasting 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, during Trump’s first term in office, due to a stalemate between the president and Congress over border security.\n\nWhat happens during a government shutdown?\n\nIf Congress does not pass the budget legislation or if Trump does not sign it, federal government agencies and programs that rely on annual funding will be paused. During a government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers considered nonessential would be furloughed, meaning they would not work and would not get paid until funding is restored.\n\nEssential workers in fields such as law enforcement and the military remain on the job without pay, and both groups are eventually reimbursed once the government is funded and reopens.\n\nDo Social Security payments continue in a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security benefits, including Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and benefits for retirement, disability and survivors, continue uninterrupted through government shutdowns.\n\nMoney for Social Security benefit programs is considered mandatory spending by law, meaning its budget is not dependent on yearly congressional approval, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA). Unlike discretionary spending, which requires congressional agreement on how money will be spent, mandatory programs must continue, meaning Social Security payments are distributed on a regular schedule.\n\nIf you rely on these benefits, you should continue to receive your check or direct deposit as usual, regardless of what happens on Oct. 1.\n\nOther services provided by the SSA, however, such as processing new applications, can be impacted by shutdowns and the resulting lack of workers and movement in government systems.\n\nWhat challenges do Social Security beneficiaries face in a government shutdown?\n\nWhile existing payments continue without disruption, people newly in need of Social Security benefits or in the process of applying may face significant delays during government shutdowns.\n\nPeople looking to apply for and access retirement, disability or survivor benefits for the first time are likely to face extended wait times. With fewer employees actively working to process applications, review qualifications and provide necessary documentation, those seeking to renew or start receiving benefits contend with a backlog in these processes.\n\nThis is especially true of anything that requires a manual review. Medical assessments for disability benefits, appeals or recertifications for denied or recurring payments and benefit calculations for families of recently deceased federal employees or veterans are all examples of processes that can be significantly delayed or paused altogether in a shutdown.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-stock-market-us-economy/86442467007/", "title": "Will federal government shutdown last long enough to hurt U.S. ...", "text": "Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. said the impact on the economy and financial markets will be limited if the federal government shutdown lasts just a week or two.\n\nMany federal employees will not be paid during the shutdown and household budgets will be squeezed. The U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union is offering a federal shutdown relief loan.\n\nHow much economic chaos could the shutdown of the federal government trigger?\n\nWe’ll know soon enough if the shutdown that began at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 1, drags beyond a few more hours or days. It’s all about duration — and any kinks already in place.\n\nWall Street opened relatively calmly Wednesday, some nine-and-a-half hours into the shutdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at 46,356.25 points, down 41.64 points or 0.09%, shortly after 9:31 a.m. Oct. 1.\n\nBy 9:40 a.m., the Dow was trading at 46,432.62 points, up 34.73 points or 0.07%. But the Dow was losing ground and dropping back again shortly before 10 a.m.\n\nThe Dow was up 88.82 points or 0.19% and trading at 46,486.71 points shortly before 3:30 p.m. Oct. 1 — a half hour before the market closed at 4 p.m.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nThe Dow closed at 46,441.10 points, up 43.21 points or 0.09% — breaking a new record on the first day of the federal government shutdown Oct. 1.\n\n“If the shutdown lasts a week or two, I don’t think it will have a material impact on the economy and financial markets,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.\n\nThat’s assuming, he said, that the Trump administration doesn’t end up firing government workers during a shutdown, as officials have said they would. If more people are fired, analysts worry that the economic impact would be much deeper.\n\nHow much could a shutdown hurt in the days ahead?\n\nIf a budget resolution isn’t reached quickly ― and a shutdown lasts a month or two, we’re talking about a totally different outlook.\n\n“The heightened uncertainty and mounting concerns regarding the nation’s governance and safe haven status this would create would be difficult for stock and bond investors to ignore,” Zandi said.\n\nWall Street and Main Street don’t tend to do well with long stretches of uncertainty.\n\nStill, haven’t we been here before? And we did OK, didn’t we? Yet, is the U.S. economy more vulnerable now than during previous shutdowns, as some consumers are more on edge?\n\nOn the one hand, we have faced the possibility of a government shutdown fairly often in our lifetimes. A shutdown, for example, was narrowly avoided back in 2023 just hours before the Sept. 30 deadline.\n\nBut you have to go back nearly seven years to the last time Congress couldn't reach a deal, and we entered a time of similar uncertainty.\n\nThis year's shutdown seemed inevitable with the White House running a \"Government Shutdown Clock\" online that already is adding up the hours, minutes and seconds of 2025 shutdown. President Donald Trump's White House site carries the banner: \"Democrats Have Shut Down the Government.\"\n\nThe most recent ― and longest ― shutdown of the federal government hit Dec. 22, 2018, and lasted through Jan. 25, 2019.\n\nLong, yes, but the economy and the stock market turned out OK after the shutdown seven years ago during the first Trump administration. The last federal shutdown was viewed as a \"partial\" shutdown because Congress had already enacted a handful of spending laws.\n\nA government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass spending legislation but not all federal services stop.\n\nHow did stocks do during the 2018-19 shutdown?\n\nThe last go-round didn't cause a panic on Wall Street.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down 7.1% a week before the 2018-19 shutdown began, according to data from CFRA Research. The S&P 500 index fell 2.7% on Day One of the shutdown that dragged into 35 days. The S&P 500 rose 10.3% the entire lengthy shutdown. The index rose an additional 4.8% in the 30 days after the shutdown ended.\n\n\"Most on Wall Street are cynical about the impact of government shutdowns,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA Research chief investment strategist.\n\nStovall says he likes to view government shutdowns as “more of a headline event than a bottom-line event.”\n\nWhile the news is certainly worth watching, he said, the economic impact on retirement savings and other investments tends to be limited.\n\nThis shutdown began on a Wednesday. But Stovall noted that 12 of the last 21 shutdowns took place on a weekend ― a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The 11 shutdowns since 1984 only lasted a median of four days, Stovall said.\n\nNew York’s weekend tourists, he said, tend to face more challenges than Wall Street traders who are dealing with a Monday through Friday grind. An extended shutdown, after all, can lead to flight delays and longer waits at airports.\n\nThe financial fallout has tended to be much less in the early moments after a shutdown as Wall Street traders are more accustomed to government shutdowns, Stovall said.\n\n“No one knows for sure how Wall Street will react this time, but I think no differently than in the past,” Stovall said.\n\nInvestors are more focused, he said, on the monthly jobs report that was to be released Oct. 3 and whether the Fed will cut rates in October and December. The Fed's next meeting is Oct. 28 and Oct. 29, and Trump has been aggressively lobbying for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates yet again.\n\nIf the government remains shut down, Stovall said, no jobs report will be issued as the U.S. Department of Labor will delay releases of economic data.\n\nIn that case, Wall Street traders will be looking at other data that’s available, including the recently issued slightly better-than-expected Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and weaker-than-expected Consumer Confidence reports.\n\nEveryday households will focus on other issues, such as: Will I get paid on time? How much money might I lose if the shutdown lasts into November or December?\n\nSome things will continue as usual: Social Security payments are expected to arrive on time. Military personnel, air traffic controllers, and other essential personnel must work but may not be paid on time.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed without pay. Many will not be paid during the shutdown and household budgets will be squeezed.\n\nThe U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering a federal shutdown relief loan of up to $5,000 with no payments for 90 days. We saw credit unions offer similar types of loan relief to UAW workers on strike at the Detroit Three automakers in 2023.\n\nFortunately, many federal employees hurt by the shutdown will get paid later under a 2019 law that mandates retroactive automatic pay once the shutdown ends, according to details in \"Guidance for Shutdown Furloughs\" issued in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The safety net doesn't apply to everyone. Government contractors, unlike direct federal employees, typically do not receive back pay after shutdowns.\n\nShutdown hits when Dow is breaking records\n\nOverall, the economy has been rolling along. The stock market clearly has been soaring to new heights, giving wealthier households more room to keep spending.\n\nWe've seen a record-breaking rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke yet another record on Sept. 30, as the deadline for a shutdown loomed, and closed at 46,397.89 points.\n\nEven so, concern has been building about a potentially precarious jobs picture, given that we've not yet felt the full impact of tariffs. Higher tariffs put pressure on profit margins and can lead to price hikes on many goods, as well as job cuts in some industries.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, consumers increasingly believe that labor market conditions will weaken. About 65% of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, up from 57% in July 2025 and 35% a year ago, according to the survey released Sept. 26.\n\nThe U-M Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 55.1 in the September survey, down from 58.2 in August and below last September's 70.3.\n\nMatthew Nestler, senior economist for KPMG Economics, noted in a report that the number of job openings stayed flat in August with 7.2 million jobs available nationwide.\n\nAmong different sectors, he said the federal government posted the lowest number of job openings — some 77,000 — since February 2018.\n\n“Government job openings have fallen off a cliff since the beginning of this year, despite new hiring plans for Customs and Border Protection,” he wrote in a Sept. 30 report.\n\nThe unemployment rate has remained low but the expectation is for slower economic growth.\n\n“Labor demand is falling while labor supply is declining due to curbs on immigration and a rise in retirements,” Nestler wrote.\n\nHe noted that a low number of hires continue to be offset by a low level of firings.\n\n“Employers are likely hoarding labor due to supply-side shortages from the shift in immigration policy,” Nestler wrote Sept. 30.\n\nA lengthy government shutdown would only complicate the employment picture, and possibly, further erode consumer confidence ― a reality that could give Congress more reason to settle matters, hopefully, well before 35 days.\n\n(This story has been updated to include new information.)\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The Republican plan, which would have kept the government open until Nov. 21, failed on a 55 to 45 vote, USA TODAY reported.

Three shutdowns took place during Trump's first term in office, but one of them lasted only a few hours.\n\nWhat happens during a government shutdown?\n\nLike any home or business, the federal government must pay its bills. When Congress can’t agree on how to appropriate money for funding, non-essential departments of the government shut down. Funding expires Sept. 30.\n\nIn past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of federal workers, those deemed nonessential, have been furloughed or sent home without pay. They were reimbursed when they returned.\n\nHowever, the Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to prepare for mass layoffs, not just temporary furloughs.\n\nEmployees who are classified as essential for critical operations in defense, energy, agriculture, and other sectors would continue to work, but without pay. They are reimbursed when the shutdown ends.\n\nWhere federal employees work\n\nWhich presidents have had the longest government shutdowns?\n\nLongest single shutdown: A review shows the longest shutdown, 34 days in a row, took place under Trump, starting in December 2018 and ending Jan. 25, 2019.\n\nHighest number of shutdown days: The president with the most is Jimmy Carter, who had 56 days in five separate shutdowns from 1977 to 1979. Second is Trump, with 36 days in two shutdowns in 2018 and 2019. Bill Clinton is third with 26 days in two shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nWhat is open during a government shutdown?\n\nThough the OMB has told departments and agencies to prepare for mass layoffs, not just temporary furloughs, staffers at essential agencies would continue to work if the shutdown happens, including:\n\nDefense: Branches of the U.S. military and the Coast Guard will remain on duty.\n\nLaw enforcement and protection: The Secret Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and others would not be affected.\n\nSocial Security: Payments will continue to be processed.\n\nBorder security: Most Border Patrol officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and customs officials will keep working.\n\nNational parks: Parks often close during shutdowns, but the NPS had not officially released a shutdown contingency plan by Sept. 30. Most park staffers have been furloughed, which means no trail maintenance or restroom cleaning.\n\nPrisons: Officers would stay on the job.\n\nTravel and air traffic control: Transportation Security Administration agents at airports and air-traffic controllers are considered essential and will be required to work without pay.\n\nMail: The U.S. Postal Service will remain open.\n\nTaxes: The IRS would keep working, but a reduction of services is possible.\n\nHealth care: Federal employees with Medicare and Medicaid will keep working. Emergency workers will stay on the job but researchers have been furloughed in the Health Department and the National Institutes of Health. About two-thirds of the Centers for Disease Control have been furloughed. Food and Drug Administration staffers will continue to work.\n\nVeterans Affairs: The department will process benefits checks and continue medical services to veterans.\n\nWhat is closed during a government shutdown?\n\nHere's are some places and services that could close during a government shutdown:\n\nSmithsonian Museums & Visitor Centers: The museums could close or reduce hours during an extended shutdown.\n\nFederal Building Tours: Visitor centers are closed and tours of federal government buildings including the U.S. Capitol, White House, and FBI Building are suspended.\n\nFood Safety Inspections – Food inspectors for the Department of Agriculture will keep working but non-essential operations are suspended.\n\nFederal Agencies’ Public Outreach – Marketing and non-critical communications are paused.\n\nWIC (Women, Infants, and Children Program) – At risk of running out of funds if shutdown persists.\n\nNearly 50,000 Coast Guard employees went without pay for 35 days during a 2019 shutdown, NPR reported.

Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, said in a statement “there is little reason to applaud today’s vote on a continuing resolution,\" calling it the \"bare minimum\" to keep the government open.\n\nWhile both sides of the aisle have promised a deal to avoid government funds running dry, shutdowns haven't been rare over the last several years. Since Trump took office, the government has shut down three times, including for 35 days in 2018 – the longest-ever shutdown in modern U.S. history. It stemmed from a standoff between Congress and the White House over funding for a wall along the southern U.S. border.\n\nBut the quarrel forced about 800,000 federal government workers to be furloughed or go without pay.\n\nIf Congress and the White House aren't able to come to an agreement, thousands of government workers considered nonessential would again be furloughed or forced to work without pay until the shutdown ends. A shutdown right now could have ripple effects unlike what Americans have seen in previous years, affecting everything from government health agencies handling the coronavirus pandemic to air travel.\n\nNational parks may close, airport operations could slow and the paralysis could affect the economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated tax revenue was down $2 billion in 2019 because the IRS had halted some operations during the 2018 shutdown.\n\nAlong with coming to a deal on a spending bill, lawmakers have been negotiating a potential compromise on coronavirus relief – something they've been unable to make a deal on for months. Congress hopes to pass potentially billions for critical programs, many that have expired or are readying to cease at the end of the year, as part of the spending bill.\n\nWhile there is optimism, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have continued meeting to negotiate a deal, time is short and hurdles remain. The biggest sticking points so far have been liability protections for businesses, a key provision Republicans wanted to be part of any deal, and funds for state and local governments, money that Democrats say is crucial. Another round of stimulus checks has also emerged as another key item dividing lawmakers, as the most recent proposals being examined by lawmakers do not include another round of $1,200 checks.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/09/30/mail-stop-during-a-government-shutdown-post-offices-close-open-2025-usps-work-shutdown-date-odds/86437404007/", "title": "Is the U.S. government shutting down?

Should funds run out, federal workers will miss paychecks, families may see delays in food assistance, and air travel may slow.\n\nSome government services would stop, although the U.S. Postal Service and mail delivery would not be affected, despite a bleak outlook for a last-minute agreement in Congress. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have shown signs of budging as a midnight deadline nears, setting up a wide-scale mass shutdown of major services.\n\nWil you still get mail delivery during a government shutdown? Will your nearest U.S. Post Office be closed? Here's what to know.\n\nWhy is the government shutting down?\n\nThe current funding for the federal government expires after 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025, with Oct. 1 being the potential start of a partial government shutdown. Congress and the White House are at an impasse over whether to keep the government open or let health benefits expire for the Affordable Care Act, which benefits about 24 million Americans.\n\nEach fiscal year, Congress allocates funding for federal agencies to operate. However, if lawmakers cannot agree on appropriations or a temporary spending bill, some federal agencies must shut down or stop normal spending.\n\nDo we get mail in a shutdown?\n\nMail delivery and postal services will continue, even during a government shutdown.\n\nThe USPS confirmed on Sept. 25 that its operations won't be interrupted by the shutdown, and post offices will remain open for \"business as usual.\"\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service is an independent entity that is generally funded through the sale of their products and services, and not by tax dollars.\n\nWhat will happen when the government shuts down?\n\nDuring a government shutdown, all federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential\" must stop working.\n\n\"Essential services\" include the USPS, or mail delivery services, Medicare, Social Security services and air-traffic control at airports.\n\n\"Nonessential\" work pauses, meaning tens of thousands of federal employees would be furloughed, or not work and not get paid until funding is restored. National parks closed during past shutdowns or were kept open with state help but with fewer services.\n\nHow long do government shutdowns last?\n\nSince 1977, there have been 21 federal government shutdowns. In total, they lasted 121 days. The longest government shutdown over the last five decades lasted 35 days and occurred during Trump's first term, from December 2018 to January 2019.\n\nTwo other government shutdowns occurred during Trump's first term: the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted a few hours in February 2018.\n\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.\n\nContributing: Melina Khan, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/29/government-shutdown-trump-democrats-deal-fail/86424815007/", "title": "Will the government shut down? Trump, Dems fail to reach deal", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump and Democrats emerged from a private White House meeting on Sept. 29 without an agreement to keep the federal government open, setting up the prospects of a wide-scale shutdown in major services beginning in about 30 hours.\n\nAfter sitting down at the White House, the president and the four top congressional leaders failed to strike a deal. If funding expires at midnight on Oct. 1 – which appeared likely absent any unexpected breakthrough – a shutdown will start at 12:01 a.m.\n\n\"There was a frank and direct discussion with the president of the United States and Republican leaders,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters after the meeting with the president. But he added that \"significant and meaningful differences remain.\"\n\nThe leaders of the two parties are standing their ground, with Republicans pushing a stopgap solution that would extend current funding levels until Nov. 21 and Democrats fighting for changes, mostly related to health care access and subsidies, as part of any deal.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who attended the meeting with Trump, told reporters at the White House that if the government does close, it will be Democrats' fault. Trump listened to their arguments, he said. \"They just wouldn't acknowledge the simple facts.\"\n\nA partial closure will dramatically reduce staffing at many federal agencies (the Education Department, for example, is set to furlough nearly 90% of its employees), while workers deemed \"essential\" in areas like military and law enforcement will remain on the job. Furloughed employees typically receive backpay, but the White House has said it will fire federal workers in mass, if Democrats force a shutdown.\n\nFor weeks, Democrats have been urging Republicans to address a list of requests in exchange for their votes to keep the government open. Namely, the party has united around demands to reverse recent Medicaid cuts recently passed by congressional Republicans and Trump and to extend enhanced health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Unless action is taken, millions of Americans are expected to lose their insurance.\n\n\"We laid out to the president some of the consequences of what's happening with health care,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the meeting. \"And by his face, and by the way he looked, I think he heard about them for the first time.\"\n\nRead more: These people have found their health care at the center of a shutdown showdown\n\nRepublicans have said Democrats' should not negotiate over health care in a government funding bill. Vice President JD Vance said Democrats had some ideas that \"I actually thought were reasonable\" and could be part of a future conversation. But he said the White House would not negotiate under the threat of a government shutdown.\n\n\"I think we're headed to a shutdown, because the Democrats won't do the right thing,\" Vance told reporters following the meeting. \"I hope they change their mind, but we're going to see.\"\n\nComplicating matters further, the House of Representatives isn't likely to be in session again until after a shutdown ostensibly begins. That leaves the Senate in charge of steering the country away from a closure by winning Democratic support for the short-term funding bill that has already failed.\n\nSchumer said that Trump is ultimately the decision maker and a shutdown could be avoided if he agrees to some of Democrats' requests.\n\nRussell Vought, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, cast it as \"hostage-taking,\" however, and said Democrats' proposal was not something that the White House would accept.\n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

Mitch Hescox isn't your typical advocate for environmental causes. He’s a lifelong Republican son of a coal miner, and a man who spent more than a decade working for the coal industry.\n\nBut Hescox is also an Evangelical Christian with a message that is at the heart of a growing eco-friendly Christian movement: Scripture says to honor God's creation by caring for the earth.\n\nYellowwood protests:: How lawmakers are taking aim at logging in Indiana forests\n\nStopping in the Klan: Indiana once had a hate crimes law, but it quietly disappeared\n\nSupport local journalists: The 6 benefits of an IndyStar digital subscription\n\nThese days, Hescox travels the country spreading that message to other Evangelical Christians and in doing so is creating common ground among people who on most issues are bitter ideological opponents.\n\n“One of the things that I have found out, in the nine years I've been doing this and probably a 1,000 sermons and presentations, if not more, is that a lot of Evangelicals have not been taught what the Bible says about caring for the earth,” Hescox told IndyStar in a phone conversation.\n\n“We don't own this earth. God does. We are merely supposed to be stewards, caretakers.”\n\nHescox, who was the featured speaker at the Hoosier Environmental Council’s annual Greening the Statehouse event on Saturday, is far from alone in embracing the environment as a Christian cause.\n\nOver the past decade, several Evangelical leaders and institutions have adopted environmentally conscious resolutions. In 2011, the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, a global Evangelical organization, adopted the Cape Town Commitment. Among its many goals, the commitment “encourages Christians worldwide” to “persuade governments to put moral imperatives above political expediency” for issues related to the environment and climate change.\n\nThe same year, the National Association of Evangelicals released a 56-page paper exploring how environmental changes affect the poor and the biblical arguments for Christian engagement in environmental issues.\n\n“We are concerned when we hear projections that environmental changes threaten the lives of more and more people, particularly the extreme poor,” said NAE president Leith Anderson at the time of the release.\n\nPerhaps one of the largest tours de force for Evangelical environmentalism came in 2006, when 86 Evangelical leaders signed a Climate Initiative that called for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. At more than 200 additional leaders have signed on since then. And Hescox’s own Evangelical Environmental Network has been working on advocating for environmental policies since 1993.\n\nStill, Evangelicals are among the demographics that present the largest obstacle for environmental polices. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in August 2015 found that only 28 percent of white Evangelicals believed that the earth was getting warmer because of human activity. That proportion was smaller than any other religious affiliation represented in the poll, which focused on Christian faiths.\n\nAccording to the same survey, white Evangelicals were also more likely to support allowing offshore oil drilling. That’s a significant number of Americans, considering Evangelical Protestants make up the largest religious affiliation in the United States. In Indiana, they make up a third of the adult population.\n\nAnd as the United States has become more politically polarized, issues related to fossil fuels or pollution have ended up being married to social issues like abortion and marriage equality, issues that could be considered deal breakers for many Evangelical voters.\n\nThat’s something that frustrates Hescox.\n\n“I am and my community are probably never going to be pro-choice,” Hescox said. “The more you lump them together, the more you hurt my ability to communicate, and you exacerbate, and literally fuel, the effort of those who want to keep climate change denial out there.”\n\nMore: Evangelical leader headlines environmental event.\n\nA coal-powered past\n\nHescox grew up in a coal mining town in western Pennsylvania, where the sound a midday fire siren usually announced a mining accident. He came of age during the Vietnam War, a time he called the “God is dead” era, and ran away to Arizona for college. After earning his degree, he settled in Denver and designed equipment for the coal industry, some of which he said you might still find in coal operations around the world. He spent 14 years in the industry before hearing the call to become a pastor.\n\n“(My staff) would jokingly say that becoming president of EEN is your penance job for doing all that. And they remind me of that occasionally,” Hescox said.\n\nOver time he began to understand that caring for the planet was in line with his religious values. He started to find it in the scripture. Look no further than Genesis 2:15, for example: \"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.\" Or perhaps Matthew 24:45: \"He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'\"\n\n“I started to understand climate change and its impacts on water scarcity and food scarcity, and that led met look at what happens in the United States,” Hescox said.\n\nWhat he found is that the way humans treat the environment — and more importantly, the things we extract from it — have a detrimental effect on the health of children and adults, all of whom are God’s children.\n\nHescox finds evidence of the problem here in Indiana. He points out a 2015 Indiana Finance Authority report that stated that 80 percent of the state’s water utilities surveyed said that water quality sometimes affects the amount of water that they can use from their sources of supply, and the fact that five coal plants operate within 30 miles of Evansville alone.\n\nHow we generate energy is of particular concern to Hescox. He thinks of the premature births caused by pollutants from coal burning emissions, and the children with asthma they got from living near fracking operations. And then there’s the actual damage done to the earth during the extraction of these materials, and the devastated lives of the workers left behind when an industry shrinks.\n\n“It's economically, morally wrong to continue promoting the fossil fuel industry,” Hescox said.\n\n“There are these people who want to hang onto their businesses for as long as possible, but the problem is by doing that, they're hurting every single child of God on earth, and hurting us tremendously,” he added.\n\nMore environmental coverage:\n\nNew Indiana solar law could cripple small businesses and customer savings\n\nHow lawmakers are taking aim at logging in Indiana forests\n\nProtesters offer $150K to save Yellowwood State Forest\n\nCreation care in Indiana\n\nBut Indiana also serves another reminder. As Hescox prepared to travel to Indiana, it was not lost on him that he wouldn’t see eye to eye with the state’s highest profile Evangelical.\n\nAs governor, now-Vice President Mike Pence railed against the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean power provisions and sat by as the legislature repealed energy efficiency regulations that were reported to have not only reduced energy use but also to have saved consumers money.\n\n“I would love to get him in a room for an hour to talk to him,\" Hescox said. \"I think I could turn him around or at least partially turn him around.”\n\nMembers of various religious groups in Indiana are turning towards environmental ways to practice their faith. Though there’s no central effort or state-level version of the Evangelical Environmental Network, grassroots efforts have appeared across the state.\n\nOne of those groups is Hoosier Interfaith Power and Light, a network of congregations and religious leaders of all faiths that see caring for the environment as part of their worship.\n\n“At the core of faith is the love of people, the love of planet,” said Mike Oles, organizing director for H-IPL. “That is a spirit and a spirituality that brings together all understandings of faith.”\n\nThe group’s name is a non-accidental play on Indianapolis Power and Light, the investor-owned utility that powers Marion County. H-IPL and IPL are no strangers — they’ve met, at least ideologically, on the floor of the general assembly during the fight over Indiana solar policy, and in the chambers of the city-county council in Indianapolis as H-IPL advocated, alongside other faith-based groups, for the shuttering of IPL’s Harding Street coal power plant.\n\nIPL stopped burning coal at the plant last year, a move that made Marion County free from coal burning power plants and earned IPL an award from the Indiana chapter of the American Lung Association.\n\nH-IPL’s activism reaches across the state. As a network, they provide houses of worship with resources to help them become more energy efficient. Oles says that there aren’t a huge number of Evangelical members, but that there is lot of opportunity there.\n\n“If you have megachurch,\" Oles said, \"I don’t know why you wouldn’t have solar panels.”\n\nEnglewood Christian Church in Indianapolis isn’t a so-called “megachurch,” but that hasn’t stopped the congregation from installing 80 solar panels on the building’s roof. But the more impressive project sits across the street — nearly 550 solar panels on top of a low-income senior housing facility. Joe Bowling, the co-director for the Englewood Community Development Corporation, says that they are hoping the facility will become the first certified net energy positive multi-family building in Indiana.\n\nThe CDC, which is housed within the church, and the solar installations are the work of two decades during which the members of Englewood made moves — literally — to be able to better serve the community. In the 1990s, church members began relocating into the Englewood neighborhood. At the time, about 10 percent of the congregation lived in the neighborhood. Now it’s around 80 to 90 percent.\n\n“The very worst of Christianity is that people want to say that things are rooted in their faith, but those things are not related to their daily life,” Bowling said. “Communities of faith can have a really big impact here but they have to locate themselves where they can live and work in ways that are very much rooted and touch the ground. And I think more and more people are starting to find that.”\n\nBowling told IndyStar that much of the creation care practiced through Englewood is wrapped into other initiatives to provide walkable and affordable places within the community, and to help those who are the most vulnerable. The neighborhood is part of Great Places 2020, which invests in areas across the city to make them more livable.\n\n“We’re very passionate about creation care and stewardship, but we’re also very passionate that the benefits of stewardship and creation care don’t just go towards people who can afford it, but also to people who are often victims of environmental degradation,” Bowling said.\n\nThis is something Rev. Cheryl Rivera has come to understand all too well. As a faith leader and resident of East Chicago, Rivera has spent a lot of her time fighting for her community to have access to things as simple as clean water.\n\n“People of faith have an opportunity and an obligation to get involved outside of synagogue, outside of the mosque\", Rivera said. “The majority of the work that Christ did was outside the synagogue. He went among those who were discriminated against, He went among the outcasts, those who were left out.”\n\nRivera did not always see the value of environmental advocacy or even faith-based organizing. But now, as a Baptist minister and the executive director of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Interfaith Organizations, she sees it as the part of the way she worships. Over the past year, she’s brought East Chicago residents to the floor of the general assembly to testify about their experiences and, with the help of other community groups, has helped secure over 400,000 bottles of water for residents.\n\n“How can I be a person of faith and not be concerned about the environment? The air, the water, the soil, the ground that we walk on,\" she said. \"All of those things are things that have been given to us by God, and we have a responsibility to provide some stewardship over them.”\n\nEmily Hopkins covers the environment for IndyStar.

Government agencies issued warnings to U.S. citizens at home and abroad. And with Mideast tensions heightened, all eyes stayed glued to Iran and its response.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security came notice in the United States of a \"heightened threat environment.\" Hours later, the State Department blasted out a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nU.S. officials have heaped praise on the military operation conducted June 21, saying U.S. bombers shattered Iran's nuclear program in precision strikes − ones planned for weeks that involved 125 warplanes.\n\nWhile Israel hailed the strikes, many world leaders urged speedy de-escalation over fears of a widening Mideast conflict. Some lawmakers in the U.S. − including key progressives and rigid conservatives − questioned President Donald Trump's authority to launch the attack.\n\nFor his part, Trump wrote on social media that \"regime change\" may be needed in Iran just hours after Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not aiming for a change in leadership in Tehran.\n\nPutin to meet with Iran's foreign minister in Moscow\n\nAs Tehran weighed its options, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi is expected to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday.\n\nThe Kremlin has a strategic partnership with Iran, but also close links with Israel.

MIGA!!!,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22 as Mideast tensions continued to escalate the day after the U.S. military bombed three Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTrump's post signaling an openness to new leadership in Tehran followed Vance and Rubio appearing on the Sunday morning talk shows, arguing the U.S. focus was not on launching a war with Iran.\n\nIsrael carried out airstrikes on military infrastructure in western Iran\n\nThe Israeli military said on Monday that about 20 jets had conducted a wave of strikes against military targets in western Iran and Tehran overnight.\n\n⁠In Kermanshah, in western Iran, missile and radar infrastructure was targeted, and in Tehran a surface-to-air missile launcher was struck, the Israeli military said, Reuters reported. The Israeli military added that a missile launched from Iran in the early hours of Monday was intercepted by Israeli defenses.\n\n--Reuters\n\nHow attacks unfolded: Visual details of US bombing in Iran\n\nJapan calls for de-escalation of Iran conflict\n\nJapan called on June 23 for de-escalation of the conflict in Iran and said U.S. strikes demonstrated Washington's determination to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nJapan also said it was \"extremely regrettable\" the situation between Israel and Iran had escalated into a cycle of retaliation, according to Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.\n\n\"Japan continues to strongly hope that the path to dialogue will be reopened by efforts toward a resolution of Iran's nuclear issue through talks between the U.S. and Iran,\" Iwaya said in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. had \"obliterated\" Tehran's key nuclear sites, joining Israel in the biggest Western military action against the Islamic Republic since its 1979 revolution.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier this month condemned Israel's military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, saying deployment for military use \"cannot be absolutely condemned.\"\n\n-- Reuters\n\nTrump to meet with his national security team\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. on June 23, according to the White House.

A now-defunct panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions said in 2021 that the two countries had resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects, including the transfer of critical parts.\n\n\"Pyongyang could provide important assistance in helping Iran reconstitute destroyed missile production facilities, including at new sites to avoid scrutiny, perhaps,\" said Ankit Panda, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nWhether either country would be interested in substantively cooperating on any efforts to rebuild or accelerate Iran's nuclear weapons program is less certain, given the political and military sensitivities over such technology, Panda said.\n\n-- Reuters\n\n'Bullseye!!!': Trump again says Iran’s nuclear sites have been ‘obliterated’\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that Iranian nuclear sites had been obliterated by U.S. bombardments a day after the attacks amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\n“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on June 22. “Obliteration is an accurate term! The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame.”\n\nExperts have raised questions about the extent to which recent Israeli and U.S. strikes have thwarted Iran's nuclear program. But that hasn’t given pause to Trump’s assessment of the damage.\n\n“The biggest damage took place far below ground level,” wrote Trump. “Bullseye!!!”\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nOil hits five-month high after US strikes key Iranian nuclear sites\n\nOil prices jumped on June 23, local time, to their highest since January as Washington's weekend move to join Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities stoked supply worries.\n\nBrent crude futures rose $1.88 or 2.44% at $78.89 a barrel as of 11:22 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude advanced $1.87 or 2.53% at $75.71.\n\nBoth contracts jumped by more than 3% earlier in the session to $81.40 and $78.40, respectively, five-month highs, before giving up some gains.\n\nThe rise in prices came after President Donald Trump said he had \"obliterated\" Iran's main nuclear sites in strikes over the weekend, joining an Israeli assault in an escalation of conflict in the Middle East as Tehran vowed to defend itself.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nState Department issues worldwide caution alert and travel advisory\n\nThe State Department issued a “worldwide caution security alert” advising U.S. citizens overseas to exercise increased vigilance on June 22, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran war.\n\nThe department cited periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East and the potential for “demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad.”\n\nTravel advisories with threat levels ranging from levels 1 (exercise normal precautions) to 4 (do not travel) by country are listed in a searchable database online on the department’s website: Worldwide Caution - United States Department of State.\n\nPortugal, for example, has been designated Level 1; France is Level 2 (exercise increased caution) and Lebanon is Level 4.\n\n-- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nAustralia says it supports US strike, calls for return to diplomacy\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said on June 23 that Canberra supported the United States strike on Iran and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy.\n\n\"We support action that the U.S. has taken to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,\" Wong said in a television interview.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Wong said the strike was a unilateral action by its security ally the United States, and Australia was joining calls from Britain and other countries for Iran to return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We do not want to see escalation,\" she told reporters in Canberra.\n\nThere are around 2,900 Australians in Iran and 1,300 in Iraq who are seeking to leave.\n\nMeanwhile, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on June 22 he was examining the evidence surrounding Iran's nuclear enrichment program, while Prime Minister Christopher Luxon called for a return to dialogue, Radio New Zealand reported.\n\n-- Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement agencies on alert after US attacks on Iran\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies across the United States are deploying additional forces to protect potential targets from retaliatory attacks.\n\nThe New York Police Department, the nation’s largest police department, said it issued an advisory and deployed more resources hours after the June 21 attack.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we’re deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We’ll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC,\" the police department said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass echoed a similar message regarding the city's police department.\n\n\"There are no known credible threats at this time and out of an abundance of caution, LAPD is stepping up patrols near places of worship, community gathering spaces and other sensitive sites,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We will remain vigilant in protecting our communities.\"\n\n-- Terry Collins\n\nTrump congratulates B-2 pilots upon landing in Missouri\n\nPresident Trump congratulated the group of B-2 Spirit stealth bomber pilots who returned to the U.S. after conducting airstrikes against three nuclear sites in Iran.\n\nThe B-2s departed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri early on the morning of June 21 for the flight to Iran and returned in the early evening on June 22.\n\n\"The GREAT B-2 pilots have just landed, safely, in Missouri,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Thank you for a job well done!!! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!\"In an earlier version of the same post, Trump misspelled his own name, calling himself “Donakd.” as he congratulated the pilots.\n\n- Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUS leaders vow to 'defend ourselves' if Iran attacks\n\nU.S. leaders said earlier on June 22 that they remain ready to defend the country from any retaliatory actions from Iran.\n\n\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority,\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said at a Pentagon briefing.\n\nArmy Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, has elevated force protection measures in the region, Caine said, “especially in Iraq, Syria and the Gulf.” There are about 40,000 U.S. troops in the region.\n\nIran strikes raise concerns about oil prices\n\nInvestors are bracing for higher oil prices after the U.S. bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend. Brent crude oil, which is the global benchmark, closed at $77 a barrel on June 20, up about 10% over the previous week as Iran and Israel traded attacks. That’s the highest since January.\n\nOil trading begins at 11 p.m. UK time on June 22, and prices are likely to jump at the open, but then stabilize relatively quickly until it becomes more clear that there is a sustained supply shock, said oil analyst Rachel Ziemba in an interview.\n\nIran produces less than 5% of the world’s oil supply, and almost all of that is exported to China illicitly, said Ziemba, who runs Ziemba Insights. Analysts are more concerned about the country’s ability to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a possibility Ziemba calls “low probability, high risk.”\n\nStill, energy investors will struggle to price in that risk, which could make oil prices more volatile over the coming days and weeks, she said.\n\n− Andrea Riquier\n\nNot what 'MAGA wanted to hear': Tensions within GOP remain about Trump's Iran strike\n\nUS officials say Iran's nuke program is 'obliterated.' But is it?\n\nTrump and his defense chief say American warplanes completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan using bunker-busting bombs that have the ability to penetrate underground targets.\n\nWhile that may be the case, there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. And other U.S. officials have not used such definitive rhetoric.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main agency that assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, said hostilities would need to cease for it to resume inspections. The organization, housed within the United Nations, said it would hold an emergency meeting on June 23.\n\nThe IAEA did say June 22 that craters were visible at the Fordow site, Iran’s main location for enriching uranium But said: \"At this time, no one - including the IAEA - is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.\" Read more here.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nIran almost certainly will retaliate: But when, where and how?\n\nEuropean leaders react to US strikes: We urge Iran to negotiate\n\nThe leaders of the UK, France and Germany said in a joint statement June 22 that they would continue their diplomatic efforts to try and defuse tensions and ensure conflict does not spread further. They urged Iran not to take any actions that would further destabilize the region and called for the country to negotiate to address concerns with the nuclear program.\n\n\"We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security,\" the government heads of the three countries said.\n\nMidnight Hammer operation uses 'bunker busters,' a first in US history\n\nThe U.S. used more than a dozen multi-million-dollar, 30,000-pound \"bunker busters\" to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities in the strike, marking the weapon's first operational use, according to the Pentagon.\n\nU.S. bomber planes dropped 14 of the massive bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine told reporters.\n\nThe bombs used in the strikes, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators, or MOPs, weigh 30,000 pounds each and cost millions to produce. MOPs, also known as the Guided Bomb Unit, or GBU-57, are GPS-guided weapons designed to burrow deep into underground targets, like fortified tunnels or bunkers. The bombs are about 20 feet long and span 6 feet at their widest point.\n\nWhile Israel has bunker-busters a fraction of its weight, only the MOP has the capability to destroy or severely damage Iran's nuclear facilities, experts previously told USA TODAY.\n\nIran government might close Strait of Hormuz, a major oil route\n\nThe Iranian parliament backed a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz following the U.S. strikes on the country, but the final decision will rest with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Iran's Press TV reported June 22.\n\nAbout 20% of global oil and gas flow through the strait, which lies between Oman and Iran, and its closure could mean rising fuel prices for American consumers. The strait is 21 miles at its narrowest point, and the shipping lane is 2 miles wide in either direction.\n\nAsked whether Tehran would close Hormuz, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi didn't give a straight answer, saying: \"A variety of options are available to Iran.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio criticized any decision to block the narrow channel between Iran and Oman.\n\n“That would be a suicidal move on their part, because I think the whole world would come against them if they did that,” Rubio said in an interview with CBS.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar and Reuters\n\nLawmakers push back on Trump’s strikes under War Powers Act\n\nTrump’s ordered airstrikes have attracted criticism from both sides of the political aisle, and some lawmakers are charging that the president did not have the authority to call for the attack.\n\n“Our framers did not believe in the old way that a king could order a nation to war,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said in an interview on Fox News Sunday. “Instead, the framers gave the power to Congress so we would have a debate in front of all the American public whose sons’ and daughters’ lives could potentially be at risk.”\n\nThe Constitution puts the power to declare war in Congress' hands, and the War Powers Resolution of 1973 mandates that the president notifies Congress within 48 hours of military action. The law also limits the deployment of armed forces beyond 90 days, in the absence of a formal declaration of war.\n\nKaine has introduced a resolution in the Senate seeking to block Trump’s actions in Iran. In the House, Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, have filed a similar measure based on the War Powers Act.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\n'We're not at war' with Iran, Vance insists\n\nVice President JD Vance argued in interviews on June 22 that the U.S. is not entering an open-ended conflict in the Middle East. “We’re not at war with Iran. We’re at war with Iran’s nuclear program.” Vance told NBC’s Kristen Welker.\n\n“We do not want war with Iran,” Vance added while on Meet The Press. “We actually want peace. But we want peace in the context of them not having a nuclear weapons program.”\n\nSeparately, on ABC, Vance described the strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran as “targeted.” The Pentagon’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facility employed its most powerful bunker-buster bomb as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines, according to Pentagon officials.\n\nPentagon planners coordinated the attack with Israel to enter Iran’s airspace, said the official who had been briefed on the mission but was not authorized to speak publicly. B-2 bombers dropped GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs, the first time they have been used in combat.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar and Francesca Chambers\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer used sophisticated weapons\n\nThe U.S. attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, called Operation Midnight Hammer, differs in character, scope and destructive power from those that Trump ordered in his first administration.\n\nThose missions included a missile attack in Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons, the raid to kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the drone that killed Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian who led its Quds force.\n\nThe Iranian attacks on Saturday involved some of the most sophisticated weapons in the Pentagon’s arsenal and tapped into its commands overseeing operations from the Middle East to outer space, Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Sunday.\n\nIt took weeks to plan the Saturday attack, which involved 125 warplanes − including nearly one-third of its most sophisticated stealth bomber fleet – and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nInside the attack: Details revealed of secret US mission to bomb Iran\n\nStrikes weren't aimed at Iran regime change, US officials say\n\nThe goal of the U.S. strikes on Iran was not to prompt a regime change, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during the news briefing on the morning of June 22.\n\n\"This mission was not, has not been about regime change,\" Hegseth said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn't denied that an Iran regime change is part of Israel's military objectives, however.\n\n\"It could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak,\" Netanyahu said in an interview on Fox News' \"Special Report With Bret Baier\" a week ago. \"I think it's basically left with two things. Its plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. That's basically what Iran has. They certainly don't have the people. Eighty percent of the people would throw these theological thugs out.\"\n\nNuclear energy head fears Mideast dynamic has changed\n\nThe head of an international agency that encourages the peaceful use of nuclear technology said June 22 that the U.S. decision to bomb Iran has completely reset what was once slowly simmering tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\n“This changes the whole dynamic,” Rafel Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview on CNN.\n\nGrossi said Iran’s current governmental regime, which has been in place since 1979, has been one of the few stabilizing forces in an otherwise “very very unstable” international scene.”\n\n“I think the unraveling of the nonproliferation regime would be a tremendously serious consequence,” he said. “I think that now we need to try to go back to the negotiating table as soon as possible.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nIsraeli president says US involvement in Iran is Trump’s decision\n\nThe president of Israel said on June 22 that the United States is acting in its interests and declined to say whether Israel would need additional resources.\n\n“We are not dragging America into a war, and we are leaving aid to the decision of the president of the United States and to the team,” Isaac Herzog said in an interview on CNN.\n\nHerzog said the U.S. decision to bomb Iran was made “because the Iranian nuclear program was (a) clear and present danger to the security interests of the free world, and the United States is the leader of the free world.”\n\n-- Erin Mansfield\n\nWas Iran's nuclear material really 'obliterated'?\n\nTrump and his top defense official, Hegseth, say U.S. bombers completely \"obliterated\" Iran's three major nuclear complexes at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nThat may turn out to be the case, though there has so far been no independent assessment of that assertion from nuclear watchdogs, international officials or others with direct information of the situation on the ground. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is the main window for how the world assesses the scale and evolution of Iran's nuclear program, has not commented.\n\nAll wars are information wars, as well as ones fought with conventional weapons. One example: Iran's IRIB state broadcaster claimed that its stockpiles of enriched uranium were \"evacuated\" from all three sites before the U.S. strikes, another assertion that has not been independently verified.\n\nHegseth: Trump seeks peace, urges Iran to do the same\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the U.S. strikes on Iran as an \"incredible and overwhelming success.\"\n\nThe strikes did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people, Hegseth said. Trump \"seeks peace, and Iran should take that path,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe noted that fighter pilots and sailors aboard ships and submarines joined the attack.\n\nUS: All 3 nuke sites sustained 'severe damage'\n\nCaine said the U.S. was \"currently unaware of any shots fired at the U.S. strike package on the way in.\"\n\nThe three nuclear targets were struck from 6:40 p.m. to 7:10 p.m. ET, Caine said. He said the U.S. was also unaware of any shots fired on the way out of Iran.\n\nAll three nuclear sites \"sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" initial assessments indicate, Caine said.\n\nPope Leo urges peace, international diplomacy\n\nIn a weekly prayer on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV, the Catholic Church's first pope from the United States, called for diplomacy and peace efforts, not \"violence and bloody conflicts,\" shortly after the U.S.' military action against Iran.\n\n\"Every member of the international community has a moral responsibility: to stop the tragedy of war before it becomes an irreparable abyss,\" Leo said.\n\n\"In this dramatic scenario, which includes Israel and Palestine, the daily suffering of the population, especially in Gaza and other territories, risks being forgotten, where the need for adequate humanitarian support is becoming increasingly urgent,\" he said.\n\nIranians disconnected from world\n\nIranians have been intermittently cut off from the world since the start of Israel's air war on its military and nuclear sites more than a week ago, now joined by the United States.\n\nIran's government has imposed a near countrywide internet blackout in recent days, saying it was necessary to prevent Israeli cyberattacks and for unspecified security reasons, though some residents have reported the shutdown's efficacy has varied and sometimes they were able to get online. There have also been reported disruptions to cellphone text messages in Iran.\n\nOn June 22, NetBlocks, an organization that monitors global Internet access, reported that connectivity in Iran \"again collapsed\" in the hours before the U.S. strikes. NetBlocks also reported that Trump's Truth Social platform was \"experiencing international outages for many users,\" a scenario it said was not related to \"country-level Internet disruptions or filtering.\"\n\nUN watchdog to hold emergency meeting\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog will hold an emergency meeting in Vienna on Monday following the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, created in 1957 amid growing concern over nuclear weapons, called for an end to \"hostilities\" so that it can continue inspections in Iran.\n\n\"In view of the increasingly serious situation in terms of nuclear safety and security, the Board of Governors will meet in an extraordinary session tomorrow, which I will address,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.\n\nThe sites targeted by the U.S. strikes contained nuclear material in the form of uranium enriched to different levels, the IAEA said, according to its most recent information before Israel's strikes on Iran on June 13. The material \"may cause radioactive and chemical contamination within the facilities that were hit,\" the IAEA said. Grossi said no health impacts outside the targeted sites are expected after the U.S. strikes.\n\n“I have repeatedly stated that nuclear facilities should never be attacked,” Grossi said.\n\nWorld reacts to US bombing of Iran\n\nIsrael hailed the United States' decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites as an action that would \"deny the world's most dangerous regime the world's most dangerous weapons.\"\n\nElsewhere around the world the reaction was far more constrained. The United Nations and some leaders from Britain to Mexico called for swift de-escalation while other longtime U.S. adversaries such as Cuba and Venezuela were deeply critical of the attacks.\n\n\"There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control − with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region and the world,\" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Guterres said he was \"gravely alarmed\" by the use of U.S. force on Iran.\n\nRussia, China condemn US attacks on Iran\n\nRussia and China on Sunday condemned the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, the countries' foreign ministries said.\n\n\"The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb attacks, whatever the arguments it may be presented with, flagrantly violates international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,\" the Russian foreign ministry said in its statement. \"We call for an end to aggression and for increased efforts to create conditions for returning the situation to a political and diplomatic track.\"\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, launching a drawn-out conflict that is ongoing over three years later. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, recently suggested that the \"whole of Ukraine\" belongs to his country, even though Russia only controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said the move violates the United Nations Charter and would worsen tensions in the Middle East. The ministry urged an end to attacks for all parties to the conflict, particularly Israel.\n\nWhat we know about the US strikes on Iran\n\nTrump ordered the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, effectively joining a war that Israel started on June 13 when it started bombing Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. One of the U.S. targets was Fordow, a uranium enrichment facility hidden deep inside a remote mountain in the desert.\n\nNuclear sites at Natanz and Isfahan were also struck. Israel said it helped the U.S. coordinate and plan the strikes.\n\nTrump said all three sites were \"totally obliterated\" but an independent assessment has not yet been carried out. The International Atomic Energy Agency − the United Nation's nuclear watchdog − released a statement saying that so far it had not detected an increase in \"off-site radiation levels,\" one of the feared consequences of the strikes.\n\nWhat will Iran do now?\n\nIran's next move is being closely watched. The country has already ramped up its rhetoric.\n\n\"Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. Ahead of the U.S. strikes, Tehran signaled that if the Pentagon were to join Israel's war U.S. military bases and Navy ships in the region could be attacked.\n\nIran has a large arsenal of drones and ballistic missiles. It has been using these on Israel for days. It launched a fresh wave of missiles toward Israel hours after the U.S. bombing started. Iran might even opt for a diplomatic route, which Trump was encouraging before authorizing the U.S. attack.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/01/muslims-islam-climate-environment/1738835/", "title": "Some wish Islam would inform climate debate", "text": "AP\n\nThe Quran, Islam's holy book, is filled with more than 1,500 verses to nature and Earth\n\nEnvironmental activists believe the pull of Islam could be the ideal way to spread message\n\nQatar is hosting a U.N. conference where nearly 200 countries are trying to forge a joint plan to fight global warming\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) — At Friday prayers in Qatar's most popular mosque, the imam discussed the civil war in Syria, the unrest in Egypt and the U.N. endorsement of an independent state of Palestine.\n\nNot a word about climate change, even though the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar is hosting a U.N. conference where nearly 200 countries are trying to forge a joint plan to fight global warming, which climate activists say is the greatest modern challenge to mankind.\n\n\"Unfortunately the Arab and Islamic countries have political and economic problems,\" said Adham Hassan, a worshipper from Jordan streaming out of the al-Khatabb mosque in Doha. \"Islam calls for the protection of the environment, but the Muslim countries are mostly poor and they didn't cause pollution and aren't affected by climate change.\"\n\nOf six mosques contacted by The Associated Press in the Qatari capital, only one included an environmental message in the Friday prayers, telling those in attendance to plant trees, shun extravagance and conserve water and electricity.\n\nThe Quran, Islam's holy book, is filled with more than 1,500 verses to nature and Earth. Yet the voice of Islamic leaders is missing from the global dialogue on warming.\n\nThat disappoints Muslim environmental activists, who believe the powerful pull of Islam could be the ideal way to change behavior in both poor countries, where many people's main source of information is the mosque, and in some wealthy countries like Qatar where Islam remains important even as rapid growth has made it the world's top per capita emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\n\"It's absolutely frustrating,\" said Fazlun Khalid, founder of the U.K.-based Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Sciences, which oversees projects around the world that use Islamic teachings to combat problems ranging from deforestation to overfishing.\n\n\"We get very little support from Muslims,\" he said. \"They don't connect. We have to wake them up to the fact their existence is threatened by their own behavior. Modernity and the economic development paradigm is about dominating nature. Islam, as you are aware, is submission to the will of the creator. We need to remind ourselves that we have to submit.\"\n\nAs the annual U.N. climate conference neared its halfway point in Doha, the usual splits opened up between rich and poor nations over how to divide the burden — and financial cost — of protecting the world from overheating.\n\nU.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres lamented that she didn't see \"much public interest, support, for governments to take on more ambitious and more courageous decisions.\"\n\n\"Each one of us needs to assume responsibility. It's not just about domestic governments,\" she said.\n\nThe talks are aimed at limiting the level of warming to 3.6 F, compared to temperatures before the industrial revolution. So the main focus is to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases that a vast majority of climate scientists say is to blame for the rising temperatures.\n\nThat goal gets more difficult to reach ever year. Temperatures have already risen about 1.4 degrees F, according to the latest report by the U.N.'s scientific panel on climate change. And a series of reports before and during the conference warned that global emissions are still increasing, primarily driven by the rapid growth of emerging economies such as China and India.\n\nWorld religions are seeking a more active role in climate change and sustainability issues. The Interfaith Declaration on Climate Change project — endorsed by Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism — was a regular presence at the U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009, while the Dalai Lama has repeatedly called on governments to take climate change more seriously. Religious leaders in the United States have launched a movement known as \"green religion\" or \"eco-theology, with groups like the Evangelical Environmental Network endorsing clean energy and calling on people to consume less.\n\nMuslims are also slowly heeding the call.\n\nEgypt's government-appointed Muslim Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, also known at the green mufti, has been outspoken on pollution and climate change, calling them greater threats than war, according to the consultancy Green Compass Research. The holy month of Ramadan has taken on a greener theme, with Muslims across the Middle East and the United States using it to touch on food waste and sustainability. Small-scale campaigns using Islam including one aimed at turtle conservation in Malaysia and illegal mining in Indonesia have been rolled out.\n\n\"It's becoming a more important part of Islamic discourse, a more holistic approach to what it means to be a responsible Muslim in the world today,\" said Tamara Sonn, a humanities professor at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. \"There are greater levels of education and overall global awareness of the importance of environmental concerns facilitated by advances in communication, the Internet.\"\n\nBut Muslim environmental activists say more could be done.\n\nToo often, they complain, discussions of the role of Islam and the environment are limited to conferences. They say religious leaders could issue fatwas on the environment, and governments could introduce curriculums in schools highlighting themes found in the Quran such as the importance of nature, treating animals compassionately and the prohibition on wastefulness.\n\n\"The majority of Muslim scholars, leaders, and activists whose major concerns are ritualistic and the legalistic aspects of Islam, themselves have not seen the environmental issues and problems as their immediate concern,\" Muhamad Ali, assistant professor Islamic Studies University of California, Riverside, said in an email. \"While they focus on the purity and validity of a ritual act, they lack understanding and awareness of the immediacy and cruciality of the environment crisis as a common problem. Besides, like other monotheists in general, they see human beings as superior over the natural world.\"\n\nKhalid has seen firsthand how Islam can persuade Muslims to change their ways on sustainability issues. He once went to Zanzibar after conservation groups failed to persuade fishermen to stop using dynamite on coral reefs. After leading several workshops that leaned heavily on Quranic teachings, he said the fishermen never again used destructive practices.\n\n\"They stopped dynamiting coral reefs in 24 hours,\" said Khalid, who has similar successes in Nigeria and Pakistan with forest protection. \"It had a profound impact on the local fishermen. One of the fishermen told me that we can disobey the laws of the government but we can't disobey the laws of the creator.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/09/25/pope-francis-united-nations-address-migrants-climate/72746990/", "title": "Pope Francis pushes world leaders at U.N. to protect environment", "text": "Oren Dorell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPope Francis called on world leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York on Friday to take firm action on the environment, blaming a \"selfish and boundless thirst for power and material\" for its destruction.\n\n\"We human beings are part of the environment,\" Francis said. \"We live in communion with it, since the environment itself entails ethical limits which human activity must acknowledge and respect. ... Any harm done to the environment, therefore, is harm done to humanity.\"\n\nThe speech to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly expanded on themes Francis has already discussed during his whirlwind trip to the United States and Cuba. His visit to the United Nations is the fifth by a pope.\n\nWhere is Pope Francis? A schedule of his U.S. visit\n\nSpeaking in Spanish, Francis greeted the citizens of all the nations represented in the hall before addressing the global dangers of unlimited power.\n\nThe U.N. was created after World War II, at a moment of history \"marked by our technical ability to overcome distances and frontiers and, apparently, to overcome all natural limits to the exercise of power,\" he said. The U.N. was created as a response to technological power that, \"in the hands of nationalistic or falsely universalist ideologies, is capable of perpetrating tremendous atrocities,\" he added.\n\n\"The U.N. founding charter is based on the development and promotion of international law,\" Francis said. \"The limitation of power is an idea implicit in the concept of law itself. ... No human individual or group can consider itself absolute, permitted to bypass the dignity and the rights of other individuals or their social groupings.\"\n\nOn the environment, Francis said Christians and other religions believe man is supposed to take care of nature. \"He is not authorized to abuse it, much less to destroy it.\"\n\nPope Francis to visit site of Sept. 11 terror attacks\n\nEnvironmental destruction goes hand-in-hand with injustice, and is a result of a system that is too focused on material wealth, Francis said.\n\n\"A selfish and boundless thirst for power and material prosperity\" that misuses natural resources and degrades the environment also leads to social ills by excluding those who are physically, economically or politically weak, he said. \"Economic and social exclusion is a complete denial of human fraternity and a grave offense against human rights and the environment.\"\n\nFrancis also discussed the need to address other \"scourges\" of the world. He called for the elimination of nuclear weapons and urged world leaders to work \"toward the complete prohibition of these weapons.\" He praised the Iran nuclear deal reached through diplomacy, and said he hopes it will last, \"with the cooperation of all the parties involved.\"\n\nPope Francis in America\n\nHe spoke of \"military and political interventions not coordinated with members of the international community,\" singling out the strife spreading across the Middle East, where the radical Islamic State has been growing and warring against governments across the Arab world and North Africa.\n\n\"I must appeal to you regarding the painful situation in the entire Middle East and North Africa where Christians and even members of the majority religion have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, places of cultural heritage,\" Francis said. Many of those people are \"paying for their religious belief with their own lives or though slavery,\" he said.\n\nHe scolded the assembled delegates that in response their reaction \"has to be more than drawing up lists of strategies and disagreements.\"\n\n\"The international community should do all it can to stop and prevent systematic religious violence against ethnic and religious minorities and to protect innocent peoples,\" he said. Similar attention needs to be given to conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, Iraq and parts of Africa, he said.\n\nPope Francis steers clear of politics in NYC homily\n\nHe urged world leaders to put aside partisan and individual interests to seek the common good and benefit ordinary men, women and children who suffer the most from the poverty, conflicts and misdeeds of the world.\n\nMissing from the pope's address was the topic of Europe's growing migrants crisis, which he was largely expected to address head-on. Addressing Congress in Washington on Thursday, the Argentine Pope described himself as the son of immigrants addressing a nation of immigrants as the world faces the worst refugee crisis since World War II.\n\nFuture generations should be taught that \"to live as nobly and as justly as possible,\" they should \"not to turn their back on our neighbors,\" he told lawmakers. Immigrants should be viewed as persons, not numbers, and treated in a way that is \"humane, just and fraternal,\" he added.\n\nBefore the pontiff's address Friday, U.N. General Secretary Ban-Ki Moon thanked Francis “for demonstrating once again your remarkable global stature as a man of faith among all faiths.”\n\nFrancis began his visit to the United Nations by blessing U.N. staff and laying a wreath for U.N. workers who have died in service. His characteristic warmth and sense of humor was evident. \"I will pray for each one of you and your families. I ask each one of you to pray for me,\" he said. \"If any of you are not a believer, I ask you to wish me well.\"\n\nHe then rode through the U.N. building in a golf cart, surrounded by throngs of staffers and diplomats standing behind rope lines, waving and taking pictures with their phones.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, crowds lined the streets along 2nd Avenue near the United Nations building and security to get into the area was tight. Some demonstrators protested the church's LGBT stance. One carried a sign that said \"Homophobia kills.\" Nearby, church groups celebrated the pontiff's arrival.\n\nWhile the fanfare was hardly what greeted the Pope’s arrival in New York and his parade down 5th Ave Thursday night, there were plenty of people excited to catch a glimpse of the leader of the Catholic Church on a clear, sunny day in Manhattan.\n\nPam Cowart, 49, arrived in New York with her daughter Niki, 22, from Baton Rouge, La. They scheduled a trip to the city six months ago, but then learned that only New York residents could get tickets to see the Pope while he's there. To make up for it they printed out a “Pope-selfie” cutout to take pictures of themselves in sites around town.\n\nRebeca Melendez, 40, of Los Angeles got a spot at 6 a.m. by the barricades to see Francis. Melendez came to New York to see rock singer Billy Joel and the pope, \"quite a combination,\" she said.\n\nThe United Nations event was the first on the pope's itinerary Friday, his only full day in New York City after traveling from Washington. On Saturday, he will travel to Philadelphia.\n\nContributing: Eli Blumenthal in New York City.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/22/homeland-security-warning-threats-after-iran-bombing/84307932007/", "title": "US issues warning on heightened threat of attacks by Iran", "text": "Homeland Security officials are warning Americans of heightened threats in the United States after the attacks on Iran.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory on June 22 saying attacks from low-level cyber \"hacktivists\" are likely, and larger attacks could follow if Iranian leaders issue a religious ruling \"calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland.\"\n\nThe agency said Iran has a longstanding commitment to strike American government officials following the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020, but the attacks on Iran will likely amplify that commitment.\n\nIn addition, officials said they could trigger more anti-Semitic attacks in the United States.\n\n\"Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,\" the advisory issued at noon ET said.\n\nThe United States struck three nuclear facilities in Iran in a stealth bombing raid that began on June 21. Using so-called bunker-buster bombs for the first time in such a military operation, B-2 bombers were used in the mission targeting Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz.\n\nThe attack, dubbed \"Operation Midnight Hammer,\" involved more than 125 warplanes, submarines, and surface warships, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters.\n\nHow serious is the alert?\n\nThe Homeland Security advisory warning lasts for 90 days through Sept. 22. \"The Iranian Government has publicly condemned direct US involvement in the conflict,\" the advisory noted.\n\nAdditionally, the advisory said that U.S. law enforcement \"has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020\" and also warns \"the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel, or linked to the US government or military in the Homeland.\"\n\nThe likelihood of violent extremists in the United States independently mobilizing to carry out attacks could increase with the issuance of a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence in the United States.\n\nDuring a Pentagon briefing on June 21, Caine said the United States is now on \"high alert\" for any retaliation from Tehran after the strikes on Iran.\n\n\"Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice,\" Caine said. \"We will defend ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority.\"\n\nWhat happened to Soleimani?\n\nSoleimani was killed at Baghdad International Airport in Iraq in a U.S. drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump in January 2020.\n\nThe Defense Department said it conducted the attack at Trump's direction as a \"defensive action\" against Soleimani, who the Pentagon said was planning further attacks. At the time of his death, the Pentagon said Soleimani and his troops were \"responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.\"\n\nAs a top military leader, Soleimani was considered an influential figure inside Iran. He headed Iran's elite Quds Force, part of the country's hard-line paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe unit oversaw Iran’s overseas operations and was considered by U.S. officials to be a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2018, Soleimani called Trump a \"gambler\" and said: \"You will start the war, but we will end it.\"\n\nDuring his June 21 address announcing the United States' bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, Trump mentioned Soleimani by name.\n\n\"For 40 years, Iran has been saying, 'Death to America, Death to Israel.' They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with roadside bombs. That was their specialty,\" Trump said. \"We lost over 1,000 people, and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and around the world have died as a direct result of their hate.\n\n\"In particular, so many were killed by their General Qasem Soleimani,\" Trump added. \"I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. It will not continue.\"\n\nIranian hacktivists may want to 'unhinge our society'\n\nThe Homeland Security advisory said that both hacktivists and Iranian government-affiliated actors \"routinely target poorly secured U.S. networks and Internet-connected devices for disruptive cyber attacks.\"\n\nThese disruptors are pretty sophisticated and may be ready to strike, said Gregory Falco, a Cornell University engineering professor and cybersecurity expert, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It’s an informal army of its own, so to speak,\" Falco said. \"Iran goes after things where there could be serious implications for society; They want to unhinge our society.\"\n\nFalco said the hacktivists will likely target electric grids, dams and water treatment plants, hospitals, and space infrastructure.\n\n\"I think this is what we will see first,\" Falco said. \"These systems are relatively poorly protected compared to military and defense capabilities, and they could have significant collateral damage when attacked.\"\n\nFalco believes some of those hackers might already be lurking around in those critical infrastructure networks.\n\n\"They generally are not doing anything, they are quietly hanging out there and they are waiting to pounce when ready,\" Falco said. \"It doesn't take long for them to take action; it takes long for them to get inside those systems.\"\n\nFalco said the Iranian hackers are persistent and pervasive, noting their cyber operations are highly effective.\n\n\"Iran isn’t going to take this attack quietly,\" Falco said.\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer: Details of the US bombing in Iran\n\nUS law enforcement agencies are on alert after US attacks on Iran\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies around the United States are deploying additional forces to protect potential targets from retaliatory attacks.\n\nThe New York Police Department, the nation’s largest police department, said it issued an advisory and more resources hours after the June 21 attack.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we’re deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across NYC and coordinating with our federal partners. We’ll continue to monitor for any potential impact to NYC,\" the police department said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass echoed a similar message regarding the city's police department.\n\n\"There are no known credible threats at this time and out of an abundance of caution, LAPD is stepping up patrols near places of worship, community gathering spaces, and other sensitive sites,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We will remain vigilant in protecting our communities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Michigan State Police reminded community members to be on alert amid concerns about retaliation after the strikes, the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a social media post that she called for a briefing with the Michigan National Guard and the Michigan State Police after the U.S. military strikes.\n\n\"We’re monitoring the situation in Iran closely and taking steps to keep Michiganders safe,\" Whitmer said.\n\nCivil rights organizations are also monitoring the situation\n\nSome civil rights organizations are also monitoring the situation after the U.S. strike on the Iranian regime's nuclear sites.\n\nAnti-Defamation League (ADL) CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said the ADL's Center on Extremism will continue to monitor extremist responses and potential threats against the Jewish community.\n\n\"We are engaged with elected officials in Washington D.C., and across the country to ensure the safety of the Jewish community is a top priority,\" Greenblatt said in a statement. \"We will also continue to work closely with law enforcement and our communal partners to ensure Jewish communities around the globe are safe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, blasted Trump’s attack as an \"illegal and unjustified act of war\" that favors the wishes of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu over the American people and threatens to drag the United States into a wider conflict.\n\n\"We condemn President Trump’s illegal and unjustified act of war against Iran,\"CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awadsaid in a statement. \"This attack, carried out under pressure from the out-of-control Israeli government, took place despite the longstanding conclusion by our nation’s intelligence community that Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\"Just as President Bush started a disastrous war in Iraq pushed by war hawks, neoconservatives, and Israeli leaders like Netanyahu, President Trump has attacked Iran based on the same type of false information put forward by those who consistently seek to drag our nation into unnecessary and catastrophic wars,\" Awad said.\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/11/26/expectations-un-climate-change-conference-paris/76407178/", "title": "UN secretary-general speaks out on climate change", "text": "Ban Ki-moon\n\nFor the nearly nine years that I have been Secretary-General, I have traveled the world to the front lines of climate change and I have spoken repeatedly with world leaders, business people and citizens about the need for an urgent global response.\n\nWhy do I care so much about this issue?\n\nFirst, like any grandfather, I want my grandchildren to enjoy the beauty and bounty of a healthy planet. And, like any human being, it grieves me to see that floods, droughts and fires are getting worse, that island nations will disappear and uncounted species will become extinct.\n\nAs His Holiness Pope Francis and other faith leaders have reminded us, we have a moral responsibility to act in solidarity with the poor and most vulnerable who have done least to cause climate change and will suffer first and worst from its effects.\n\nSecond, as the head of the United Nations, I have prioritized climate change because no country can meet this challenge alone. Climate change carries no passport; emissions released anywhere contribute to the problem everywhere. It is a threat to lives and livelihoods everywhere. Economic stability and the security of nations are under threat. Only through the United Nations can we respond collectively to this quintessentially global issue.\n\nThe negotiation process has been slow and cumbersome. But we are seeing results. In response to the UN’s call, more than 166 countries, which collectively account for more than 90 percent of emissions, have now submitted national climate plans with targets. If successfully implemented, these national plans bend the emissions curve down to a projected global temperature rise of approximately 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.\n\nThis is significant progress. But it is still not enough. The challenge now is to move much further and faster to reduce global emissions so we can keep global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. At the same time, we must support countries to adapt to the inevitable consequences that are already upon us.\n\nThe sooner we act, the greater the benefits for all: increased stability and security; stronger, more sustainable economic growth; enhanced resilience to shocks; cleaner air and water; improved health.\n\nWe will not get there overnight. The climate change conference in Paris is not the end point. It must mark the floor, not the ceiling of our ambition. It must be the turning point towards a low-emission, climate-resilient future.\n\nAround the world, momentum is building. Cities, businesses and investors, faith leaders and citizens are acting to reduce emissions and build resilience. The responsibility now rests with governments to conclude a meaningful, binding agreement in Paris that provides clear rules of the road for strengthening global ambition. For this, negotiators need clear guidance from the top.\n\nI believe this is forthcoming. The leaders of the G20, who met earlier this month in Antalya, Turkey, showed strong commitment to climate action. And more than 120 heads of state and government have confirmed their participation in Paris, despite heightened security concerns in the wake of the terrorist attacks.\n\nI see four essential elements for Paris to be a success: durability, flexibility, solidarity and credibility.\n\nFirst, durability. Paris must provide a long-term vision consistent with a below 2 degrees trajectory, and send a clear signal to markets that the low-carbon transformation of the global economy is inevitable, beneficial and already under way.\n\nSecond, the agreement must provide flexibility so it does not need to be continually renegotiated. It must be able to accommodate changes in the global economy and strike a balance between the leadership role of developed countries and the increasing responsibilities of developing countries.\n\nThird, the agreement must demonstrate solidarity, including through financing and technology transfer for developing countries. Developed countries must keep their pledge to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 for adaptation and mitigation alike.\n\nFourth, an agreement must demonstrate credibility in responding to rapidly escalating climate impacts. It must include regular five year cycles for governments to assess and strengthen their national climate plans in line with what science demands. Paris must also include transparent and robust mechanisms for measuring, monitoring and reporting progress.\n\nThe UN stands fully ready to support countries in implementing such an agreement.\n\nA meaningful climate agreement in Paris will build a better today — and tomorrow. It will help us end poverty. Clean our air and protect our oceans. Improve public health. Create new jobs and catalyze green innovations. It will accelerate progress towards all of the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why I care so deeply about climate change.\n\nMy message to world leaders is clear: Success in Paris depends on you. Now is the time for common sense, compromise and consensus. It is time to look beyond national horizons and to put the common interest first. The people of the world — and generations to come — count on you to have the vision and courage to seize this historic moment.\n\nBan Ki-moon is secretary-general of the United Nations, www.un.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/09/18/paul-gosar-boycotting-pope-francis-speech/72402396/", "title": "Arizona congressman Paul Gosar to boycott pope's speech", "text": "Matthew Daly\n\nAssociated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — A Republican lawmaker said he will boycott Pope Francis’ speech to Congress next week because of the possibility the pontiff will discuss his support for policies to fight climate change.\n\nThree-term Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona said that as a Catholic, he initially was excited to learn of the pope’s visit to Washington and his address to Congress. But Gosar said he decided not to attend after he read media reports that the pope plans to devote much of the speech to advocating for what Gosar calls “flawed climate change policies.”\n\nIn a column Thursday on the conservative website townhall.com, Gosar wrote that he was appalled by a papal teaching document that “condemned anyone skeptical of the link between human activity and climate change.” He said that if the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology or spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, “I would be there cheering him on.”\n\nIf the pope “urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly,” Gosar added. “But when the pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.”\n\nAs an elected official and a Catholic, Gosar said he has “a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life.”\n\nNo one knows exactly what Pope Francis will say to Congress. But Vatican aides have said that throughout his U.S. trip, he will press his message on the environment, immigration and caring for the poor. The pope has called on government leaders worldwide to take bold action to address climate change and has said he hoped his teaching document, or encyclical, would help influence the United Nations climate talks at the end of the year.\n\nThe Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, told Vatican television Thursday that in his speeches to Congress and the UN the pope will emphasize the encyclical’s message on the need to protect the environment.\n\nIf Pope Francis wants to devote his life to fighting climate change, Gosar said, he should do so in his personal time — not as pope. “To promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous,” he said.\n\nGosar most recently pushed for the impeachment of EPA chief Gina McCarthy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2014/10/18/pates-conflict-hunger-reinforce/17530149/", "title": "Pates: Conflict and hunger increase each other", "text": "By Bishop Richard E. Pates\n\nThis is the prepared text of the keynote address Richard E. Pates, the bishop of the Des Moines Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, delivered Tuesday at the Iowa Hunger Summit.\n\nI welcome all of you from across Iowa and the country to our beautiful city of Des Moines. The opportunity to address you is one of the wonderful perks of being the Bishop of Des Moines.\n\nI often remind people that Iowa is in the heartland of our great nation. We are not the heartland simply because we are part of our country's breadbasket, but also because we give witness to a heartfelt solidarity with those who live in poverty and hunger, both here in the United States and abroad. Dr. Norman Borlaug, our favorite son, gave witness to this with his life's work.\n\nFor me as a Catholic bishop, food security and the relationship between food and peace are moral issues. In our Christian tradition we believe that lifting people out of poverty and feeding the hungry are serving Jesus in disguise. \"For I was hungry and you gave me to eat.\" (Matthew 25)\n\nRecently, I stood on the Mount of Beatitudes and celebrated Mass with 17 of my brother bishops on a Prayer Pilgrimage for Peace in the Holy Land. In the Beatitudes, we read: \"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied\" and \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\" (Matthew 5: 6, 9)\n\nThese two Beatitudes connect the righteous pursuit of justice and the building of peace. People whose basic necessities of life are satisfied are less likely to engage in conflict. Peace is the fruit of justice.\n\nToday, I want to speak to you based on my ministry as the chair of the Committee on International Justice and Peace of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Through my work with the members and staff of the committee and extensive travel around the world, I've encountered people in many developing countries struggling to overcome the effects of poverty, hunger and conflict.\n\nI've also seen the inspiring and humbling work of the church to support those in need through acts of solidarity, charity and empowerment. I have witnessed the mission of Catholic Relief Services that partners with the church in the developing world to alleviate hunger and poverty and build peace. CRS serves all on the basis of need, not creed.\n\nI have learned a lifetime of lessons in these past three years as chair of the International Committee. Drawing from my solidarity trips, I hope to describe what hunger in the developing world looks like and to explore three root causes of hunger: conflict, climate change and the harmful expropriation of land from poor farmers, so-called \"land-grabbing\".\n\nWhat does hunger in our world look like? The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 805 million people live with hunger: one in nine people on the planet. The vast majority of the hungry lives in the developing world. Hunger rates are highest in Africa where more than 25 percent are chronically hungry.\n\nIn response to this unacceptable level of hunger in a world of abundance, Pope Francis said: It is a scandal that there is still hunger and malnutrition in the world! It is not just a question of responding to immediate emergencies, but of addressing altogether, at all levels, a problem that challenges our personal and social conscience, in order to achieve a just and lasting solution.\n\nHunger strikes hardest at the most vulnerable people. In 2013, over 6 million children under the age of 5 died, 45 percent of them from the effects of severe hunger or malnutrition that weakens their bodies and makes them helpless to fight many curable diseases. That is more children than died from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. One in three children in the developing world is stunted and will suffer the physical, cognitive and psychological effects throughout their entire lives, crippling their ability to thrive as God's children.\n\nIn a visit to Kabgayi in Rwanda last year, along with my host Bishop Smaragde Mbonyintege, president of the Rwanda Bishops Conference, I witnessed a young man otherwise well-built dragging a leg as he crossed the school yard. Explaining his condition, the bishop said: \"Like so many youth, he gets plenty to eat, but the food lacks nutritional value to develop fully.\"\n\nDespite unacceptable statistics, we have reason to hope. In the last decade, the number of hungry people in our world has dropped by 100 million. Our biggest challenge is in Africa where today one in four African men, women and children face food insecurity. (FAO State of Food Insecurity in the World 2014.)\n\nI traveled to Africa four times during my tenure on the committee. We visited countries that are in the throes of conflict or are struggling to emerge from conflict. In South Sudan and the Central African Republic, I've met men and women and their families living in camps after being driven from their homes because of civil war. Many of these families have lost everything, their homes, clothing and even kitchen equipment and farming tools.\n\nI've carried, hugged and played with their children who suffer the most. Education is halted and curable diseases go untreated while other illnesses, like cholera, appear because clean water and proper sanitation in the camps are difficult to provide. Agricultural production drops in conflict zones and, as a result, food markets cease to operate and food is barely available for purchase. Organizations like Catholic Relief Services are working in South Sudan and the Central African Republic to fill the gap and save lives created by the fighting.\n\nViolent conflict is development in reverse. It destroys all the hard-won progress in human development and sets people back decades. I have been in South Sudan twice. It won its independence in 2011 after 40 years of horrible civil war that killed about 2 million people. For three years, the country had an opportunity to educate its children, provide basic health care and assist rural farmers to increase their food production. The country's leaders had the enormous bounty of oil wealth to pay for all these services.\n\nIt is tragic that instead of serving the common good and providing social services, political and military leaders turned to corruption and divisive political battles. In December last year, the political infighting turned violent and exploded into civil war that has killed some 10,000 people and displaced 1.3 million. An estimated 4 million people don't have enough food to feed their families. Famine could strike hundreds of thousands. Although the international community and U.N. agencies are seeking to respond to the crisis, there is no sign that the political and military leaders are willing to halt the fighting.\n\nI made a solidarity visit to the Central African Republic in July. It has experienced similar conflict to South Sudan where corrupt and misguided political leaders fight over access to political power and natural resource riches. This struggle provoked by political factors and the fight for control of the rich natural resources was insidiously instigated eventually between religious communities who had lived in peace for decades. What started as a fight over power and wealth led to religious conflict. In the face of this, Muslim and Christian religious leaders are now working heroically to restore trust and peace.\n\nOur committee continues to work with CRS to urge the U.S. government to intensify its efforts to stop the conflict in these countries, to provide humanitarian assistance, and to help rebuild both the governments and civil societies in order to ensure future peace and prosperity.\n\nConflict is also a concern in many parts of Latin America. I recently visited El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where the legacy of civil war and armed insurrection still weigh heavily on the shoulders of small farmers and agricultural workers. During a visit to Colombia last year, I heard first-hand accounts of the terrible conditions faced by farmers and their families at the hands of FARC guerillas and other paramilitaries. Often farmers were forced to grow illicit crops, such as coca.\n\nIt can only be hoped that the current peace negotiations to settle the conflict in Colombia, which are being energetically supported by the Catholic Church in that country, will bear rich fruit.\n\nLand-grabbing is a new threat that can cause hunger, particularly in Africa. Land-grabbing is the purchasing or leasing of large tracts of land by international investors that often violate the civil and land rights of the poor farmers who own or work the land.\n\nLong before the corruption and greed among South Sudan's elite led to the outbreak of civil war in December 2013, the country's politicians had begun to sell or lease their most fertile land to outside investors without the knowledge of the poor landholders who struggle to eke out a living for their families. In the four years preceding independence in 2011, South Sudan leaders signed land deals that handed over 12.7 million acres of land to outside investors. That amounts to over 8% of the South Sudan's total land mass, an area twice the size of Vermont.\n\nAn extensive report by the Oakland Institute shows that none of the farmers was consulted during these transactions. People lost their land rights and often were not compensated. The report concluded: \"As currently conceived, these land deals threaten to undermine the land rights of rural communities, increase food insecurity, entrench poverty, and skew development patterns in South Sudan.\"\n\nThe phenomenon of land-grabbing is occurring across Africa where foreign companies, investment firms and governmental sovereign wealth funds take advantage of countries where corruption is rampant and where land tenure laws are underdeveloped and disfavor poor landholders. In 2011, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued voluntary guidelines and acceptable practices on the responsible governance of land tenure issues. If African countries, international private companies and donor nations implemented these guidelines, the land tenure abuses or land grabbing would cease.\n\nIn a speech to the FAO, Pope Francis said, \"We are all aware that one of the first effects of grave food crises ... is the uprooting of individuals, families and communities. The separation is a painful one; it is not limited to their lands, but extends to their entire existential and spiritual environment, threatening and at times shattering their few certainties in life.\"\n\nOur Committee on International Justice and Peace has studied the phenomenon of land-grabbing and hopes to work with the church in Africa to address the negative impacts of outside investment in agriculture and find ways to ensure that resource-poor farmers in Africa can benefit from the proper infusion of outside private investment in food production.\n\nIn both Africa and Latin America, land has become a battleground in the efforts to develop and exploit natural resources, such as oil, gold, silver, iron and other metals. The role that conflict minerals have played in funding rebel militia activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is well known. In Latin America, extractives have been a source of division among local populations torn between the desire to protect their native heritage, while wishing to participate in the economic gains that proper exploitation of natural resources can promise.\n\nIn Peru, I met indigenous peoples facing eviction from their communities at the hands of large corporate investors seeking to exploit the mineral wealth of their territories. I am convinced that natural resources will only truly be blessings if there is a fair, efficient and effective regulatory structure in place that will ensure compliance with adequate safety, environmental and labor standards, and the consent and participation of local populations.\n\nPerhaps the most threatening long-term challenge to food security is the impact of climate change. Pope Francis tells us that \"Creation is a gift, it is a wonderful gift that God has given us, so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all, always with great respect and gratitude.\" He also warns that we must \"Safeguard Creation. Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us!\"\n\nIt is tragic that his prophecy is coming true in far too many places.\n\nThe International Food Policy and Research Institute reports that Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Most farmers in Africa depend on the rains. Large areas of Africa have seen their rains decrease dramatically, especially in the Sahel and in East and Southern Africa. Some countries may see up to a 50 percent reduction in crop yields by 2020. As many of you know better than I do, that would be disastrous for rural African families who produce 80 percent of Africa's food.\n\nClimate change has also fueled human conflict. In 2003 violent conflict in Darfur, Sudan, broke out. It was triggered by drastic drought conditions that started in 1983. The drought destroyed pasture lands that herders depended on to feed their animals. When herders were forced to drive their flocks deeper into farmers' lands, the animals destroyed many family crops. Farmers attacked the animals and the herders retaliated against the farmers.\n\nThe Sudan regime fueled the conflict with new arms and large scale conflict broke out in 2003. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed, and about 2 million people displaced.\n\nOur committee has been working to identify and address the injustices that occur when we destroy creation and, as a result, destroy the lives of the most vulnerable people. We are a founding member of the Catholic Climate Covenant that strives to raise awareness of looming climate changes and the effects it will have on our lives. The covenant offers us ways to lighten our carbon footprint and mitigate the ill effects climate change will have on humanity.\n\nEnvironmental and climate issues are also of critical importance in Latin America, especially in the nations of Central America that I visited this past summer. Given the size of the countries in question, and the river and water distribution systems that they share, pollution and environmental damage in one country will have dramatic and dangerous consquences for all the other sovereign states in the region.\n\nThe Catholic Church supports effective international and cross-border standards for environmental protection that will safeguard one country from suffering at the hands of illegal and imprudent practices in another.\n\nIn opening, I spoke of the relationship of justice to peace. People who can feed and support their families in dignity are less likely to be engaged in conflict. To build a more stable and prosperous world, we need to adopt policies that get at the underlying causes of conflict and hunger. Conflict increases hunger, and hunger increases conflict.\n\nIt is my hope that you will join me in urging the U.S. government to ensure that poverty-focused international assistance provides adequate funds to support others in building peace and prosperity in our world. In my travels to Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East I have seen the effects of conflict on hunger and of hunger on conflict.\n\nIn these journeys, I have also witnessed the effectiveness of the United Nations in peace-keeping and providing disaster relief under challenging circumstances. We can be proud of agencies such as Catholic Relief Services, Bread for the World and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation representatives who are on the ground and with dauntless courage confront root causes of hunger and conflict.\n\nMost recently, I was in Israel and learned first hand from the legendary Israeli statesman, Shimon Peres, of the projects of the Peres Center for Peace in Tel Aviv-Jaffa. President Peres and his associates operate from a platform of world vision. The center is developing materials that prevent conflict and provide for healthy sustenance of our brothers and sisters in the human family. The Peace Center is working on the desalinization of water, preservation of the 33 percent of food that is wasted worldwide and the development of medicines from vegetables and fruits, thus making them more universally available.\n\nAnd of course, we are at the epicenter of provision of food for the future as the World Food Prize, under the flag of Dr. Norman Borlaug, develops in union with dedicated partners strategies to nutritionally feed the world's billion inhabitants in 2050.\n\nIn my tenure as chair of the Committee on International Justice and Peace, I've been fortunate to be able to travel to 23 countries to show solidarity and support on behalf of the U.S. Catholic Bishops in a very direct and human way. Even if you cannot do the same, you are here in Des Moines attending a summit on world hunger. You could be pursuing any number of other activities, yet you are here. I commend you for your commitment to be in solidarity with people living in hunger and poverty here in our nation and across the world.\n\nAs we fill the hungry with nutritious food, we significantly reduce the possibility of deadening conflict. And as we rally to reduce conflict through peace making, millions of the starving can be fed and put on the road to achieving their inherent dignity.\n\nMay God bless your summit work and bring you success and may God bless you and your families.

Oak Flat, or Chi’chil Biłdagoteel, \"the place where the Emory oak grows,\" is also culturally important to other Southwestern tribes, and is one of Arizona's remaining riparian zones and a popular site for recreational users.\n\nThe 2,200-acre site, currently a campground on the Tonto National Forest about 60 miles east of Phoenix, has been at the heart of a nearly 20-year-long struggle among tribes, environmentalists, the U.S. government and Resolution Copper, which is owned by multinational mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP.\n\nCongress approved a land swap of other environmentally sensitive lands in Arizona for Oak Flat between Resolution and the U.S. Forest Service in December 2014 after a 10-year effort by Resolution to make the deal. Apache Stronghold filed suit in January 2021 to halt the swap.\n\nLuke Goodrich, an attorney for Apache Stronghold said the latest ruling means the U.S. will now team up with Resolution to fight Apache Stronghold.\n\n\"It's clear that several judges think that destroying a sacred site would be unlawful,\" Goodrich said, referring to the suit's latest during an appeals hearing at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of retracted or clarified statements about the process by both the CEO of Resolution Copper's owner and an attorney for the federal government as well as continued calls to support Apache Stronghold and Apache tribes from religious leaders and Native rights groups.\n\nOak Flat: sacred, beloved, coveted\n\nOak Flat occupies a narrow valley with altar sites, petroglyphs, lifegiving water and places to hike and rock climb, and is sacred to Apaches, culturally significant to other tribes and beloved by environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts.\n\nThe site also holds one of the world's largest copper deposits, which is increasingly valuable as the need for copper explodes in the push by the Biden administration to replace fossil fuel generation with renewable energy plants. Resolution Copper said it believes the mine would be an important engine for economic growth in the Arizona Copper Triangle and a major contributor to the clean energy transition.\n\nThe Forest Service was directed by Congress in 2014 to develop an environmental impact statement and consult with tribes with religious, political and cultural claims to the site. The Forest Service published the final version of that review on Jan. 15, 2021, which cleared the way for the swap to be finalized within 60 days of issuance.\n\nThe Biden administration then withdrew the statement and called on the Forest Service to produce a new one that included more robust tribal consultations.\n\nIn January 2021, Apache Stronghold filed suit in federal district to stop the swap. The Native rights group took the case to the appeals court after a judge ruled against their claims. The court rejected Apache Stronghold's assertion that the mine would pose a substantial burden to First Amendment religious practice rights.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court also denied Apache Stronghold's case, but in November, the court agreed to rehear the case in front of the entire panel of 11 judges.\n\nAt the hearing on March 21, judges raised questions ranging from the serious — such as the impact to Apache religious practice if the mine turns Oak Flat into a 2-mile-wide, 1,000-foot-deep crater through a process known as block cave mining — to the silly. One judge asked if any religious protection laws would apply if \"God says I need to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery to go to heaven?\"\n\nLegal arguments: Resolution copper mine goes back before appeals court in a major religious rights case\n\nStatements on environmental impact statement conflict\n\nDuring that hearing, a government attorney said the Forest Service would publish the new environmental impact statement sometime in spring or early summer 2023. Issuing the new review would start the 60-day clock. Anytime within that period, the administration could close the deal and hand Resolution the keys to Oak Flat.\n\nThat set off a flurry of statements and actions by Apache Stronghold, tribes and environmentalists angry that the government might not honor the court's order that 60 days' notice would be given before the final EIS would be published. Such a move would affect stakeholders and plaintiffs in the Apache Stronghold suit and two others filed in 2021 by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and environmentalists.\n\nThe other two suits are on hold, awaiting the release of the new environmental impact statement.\n\nIn May, the U.S. government wrote the 9th Circuit Court and took the statement back. \"The Department has not identified a timeframe for completing its review,\" the letter said.\n\nApache Stronghold leader Wendsler Nosie said the government didn't offer any reason for delaying the review or say how much longer it would take.\n\n\"If you want answers for that, you'll have to ask the government,\" he said.\n\nGoodrich, senior counsel at Becket, a religious liberty law firm that represents Apache Stronghold, said the government's retraction of something said in a courtroom is a \"pretty big deal,\" because attorneys carefully prepare their testimony and evidence beforehand.\n\n\"The attorney wouldn't have said that if she didn't have permission,\" Goodrich said.\n\nRio Tinto chairman: 'Pressure is on' to get the copper ore flowing\n\nIn May, Reuters reported that Rio Tinto's board chair Dominic Barton said the firm was getting \"immense pressure to proceed because of the copper reserves that are there,” during a meeting of Rio Tinto’s Australian shareholders. Barton told reporters that the pressure was coming from \"parts of the U.S. government.\"\n\nResolution shared the transcript of Barton's complete comments with The Arizona Republic. Barton said Rio Tinto was being pressured, but was committed to \"steadfastly holding to the process to make sure that if we are to do something, it has to be done properly in the way that we go through it.\"\n\nBarton and Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm are new to their jobs because their predecessors departed in the wake of a 2020 incident that shook the world's Indigenous peoples, cultural heritage protectors and their allies. Rio Tinto blew up 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Western Australia's Juukan Gorge, which were heritage sites of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples. The multinational firm has been under scrutiny ever since to ensure such incidents don't reoccur.\n\nAlthough Resolution Copper is now an official member of the team pushing for the congressional deal to be completed, the company's involvement is not expected to speed the court's ruling. A spokesperson for the company said, \"As a party (to the suit), we will help ensure that the record of information before the court is fully developed.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said that they intend to respectfully engage with the groups opposed to the mine to \"address and deepen our understanding of their concerns.\"\n\nResolution has consulted with tribes over the past decade and has used traditional Indigenous knowledge to influence the project's design, the spokesperson said, and would keep Oak Flat open for as long as it is safe to do so.\n\nNosie issued a statement saying that the U.S. is required to maintain a trust relationship with Native peoples of the land.\n\n\"Any disagreement between us would be resolved between the United States and us, the Apaches,\" he said. But he was disappointed that the government is bringing in two foreign mining companies to battle Apache people.\n\n\"Resolution Copper does not care about us, they have destroyed the world, people have suffered, land has been exploited regardless of its sacredness and now the U.S. Government is siding against us with them.\"\n\nMore entities are taking the Apaches' side, including the National Congress of American Indians. The nation's largest Native advocacy group will present a panel on the Oak Flat issue during its mid-year conference on June 5 in Prior Lake, Minn.\n\nGoodrich said Apache Stronghold's struggle with the government to preserve Oak Flat is already a \"David against Goliath\" scenario. Bringing in Resolution just makes that a \"David against two Goliaths\" battle.\n\nBut Goodrich, who said he is confident Apache Stronghold would prevail said, \"The bigger they are the harder they fall.\"\n\nDebra Krol reports on Indigenous communities at the confluence of climate, culture and commerce in Arizona and the Intermountain West.

Yesterday, I enjoyed the pleasure of strolling with my two-year-old granddaughter through the Capital Mall and around the Tidal Basin to enjoy this magical sea of pink and white.\n\nAs we wandered the pathway surrounding the Tidal Basin, I was struck not only by the ephemeral blooms, but also, by the monuments to great leaders in our nation’s history--Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Looking back across the Tidal Basin, the Washington Monument towered in the distance.\n\nThomas Jefferson espoused ideas in the drafting of our constitution that all men are created equal. His basic concept of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” instructs our government to protect these basic human rights.\n\nI found two quotes inscribed on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial to be especially poignant:\n\n“In these days of difficulty, we Americans everywhere must and shall choose the path of social justice…the path of faith, the path of hope, and the path of love toward our fellow man.”\n\n\"Men and nature must work hand in hand. The throwing out of balance of the resources of nature throws out of balance also the lives of men.\"\n\nOn the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King’s assassination, citizens and leaders across the country reflected on his influence and profound statements. A deeply insightful quote from his 1967 Christmas sermon in Atlanta inscribed on the south wall behind his statue counsels, “If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.\"\n\nI later passed by the White House on my way back to the metro. I felt disheartened by the current divisive nature of our citizenry. Our President has appointed as his advisory tribe the most racially exclusive cadre since Herbert Hoover. The rhetoric being tweeted contrasts sharply with inspirational quotes of earlier leaders.\n\nI am especially concerned with the adverse impacts by federal agencies--Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and Department of Interior--directly attempting to undo policies that address our most challenging global economic, social, environmental, and energy issues. Even FOX News has challenged, \"Is draining the swamp, renting an apartment from the wife of a Washington lobbyist?”\n\nReflecting on Trump’s ‘draining the swamp’ metaphor, I suggest that we had a relatively balanced estuary in the Tidal Basin and surrounding environ prior to January 2017. Draining an estuary does not create a healthy ecosystem. It creates an inviting environment for invasive species--the opportunists.\n\nI love the beautiful cherry blossoms on display in our nation’s Capital. I love our country. I have nine grandchildren who will inherit the world my generation leaves behind. I am a fiscal conservative tasked with preserving material and energy resources for the young and as-yet unborn.\n\nWhat can you do? Take inspiration from past leaders who were more interested in the welfare of our nation than their personal fame and bank accounts. Please join the March for Science in Washington, DC and communities across the country next Saturday (April 14). The March “champions robustly funded and publicly communicated science as a pillar of human freedom and prosperity.” It is a call for us “to unite as a diverse, nonpartisan group to call for science that upholds the common good, and for political leaders and policymakers to enact evidence-based policies in the public interest.”\n\nSpecial Note: The National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade is to be held on April 14 in DC and blossoms may still be in bloom.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/07"}]}

Controversial food additive used in ...", "text": "A red food dye prevalent in candies, drinks and other products could soon be banned in the United States if federal regulators side with a petition that is under review.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has signaled that it may finally crack down on the use of the additive known as red dye No. 3, an artificial dye that gives a cherry-red coloring to thousands of American products. While the FDA has claimed that red 3, like other additives the agency has approved, can be safe to consume, advocates have long called for its ban amid concerns that the food dye is linked to cancer and behavioral problems in children.\n\nAt a U.S. Senate hearing last week, Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, said it’s been more than a decade since regulators have evaluated the safety of the synthetic color additive.\n\n“With red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks, we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jones told a health committee Thursday.\n\nWhat is red dye No. 3? Lawmakers, advocates call for ban\n\nRed No. 3 is a color additive made from petroleum that gives foods and drinks a distinctive bright red coloring.\n\nThe food dye, which is largely banned in the European Union, has for years drawn the ire of advocates, public health groups and lawmakers due to scientific studies linking it to health issues.\n\nRed No. 3 has been linked to hyperactivity in children and has also been found to cause cancer in animals, although there is not enough research linking the additive to cancer in humans.\n\nConsumer Reports, an advocacy and research nonprofit, in 2023 called on the maker of Peeps candies to stop using red No. 3 in its products. Additionally, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer food safety organization, was among 24 groups and scientists that joined Consumer Reports in starting a petition in 2022 calling on the FDA to formally remove red No. 3 from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines.\n\nFollowing last week's senate hearing, Frank Pallone, Jr., D-N.J., joined a growing list of lawmakers urging the FDA to ban the food dye.\n\n“There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” Pallone said in a statement. “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.\n\nDoes the FDA regulate red dye No. 3?\n\nWhile red No. 3 has been banned from cosmetics in the U.S. since 1990, the dye – one of nine synthetic dyes approved for use in the U.S. – remains in food products.\n\nHowever, the FDA has two regulations for the use of red No. 3 in American products, one for food and one for ingested drugs.\n\nFDA regulations specify the products in which additives like red No. 3 can be used, the maximum amounts allowed and how food dyes should be identified on food labels.\n\nIn 1990, the FDA banned red No. 3 from cosmetics and topical drugs under the Delaney Clause due to evidence that the dye is carcinogenic at high doses to lab rats. However, because the additives have not been found to cause cancer in humans, the FDA has not taken action to ban them from food.\n\nThe FDA has been reviewing that clause under a petition filed in 2022 by a slew of public health groups.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, Trump's health secretary pick, blasts additives\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination for health secretary, has spoken about the potentially harmful impacts of food dyes in American food.\n\nKennedy, who has not specified what he would do to address artificial food dyes if confirmed to the post, has a reputation for being critical of the FDA and modern medicines.\n\nKennedy has also in the past questioned the efficacy of vaccines and the origin of COVID-19. He's also spread unfounded claims about a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and he proposed the removal of fluoride from drinking water\n\nAfter California ban, states take action\n\nIn 2023, California became the first state in the nation to ban the manufacture, sale or distribution of four food additives commonly found in thousands of products across the United States, including red No. 3.\n\nIn a separate act passed this year, California moved to ban six of the nine FDA-approved artificial food dyes in public school food and drinks by 2027. The bill did not include red No. 3.\n\nSince then, more states have followed suit with bills of their own targeting the use of food additives, including Illinois and New York.\n\nThe Illinois State Senate in April passed a bill that would ban red No. 3, along with three other chemical additives, sending it next to the state House for consideration.\n\nNew York legislators also introduced a bill in February that would ban red No. 3 in food and drinks in the state.\n\nIn the past decade, bills targeting red No. 3 and other food dyes have been introduced in Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia, according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit.\n\nFood manufacturers and industry groups have long been critical of such restrictions.\n\nIn a news release responding to the Illinois bill, the National Confectioners Association said \"It’s time to stop pretending that Illinois state legislators have the scientific expertise to make these very important regulatory decisions.\"\n\n\"Usurping FDA’s authority does nothing but create a patchwork of inconsistent requirements that increase food costs, create confusion around food safety, and erode consumer confidence,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Alyssa Goldberg\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

What to know after Skittles lawsuit", "text": "In a lawsuit filed last week, a consumer alleged that Skittles were \"unfit for human consumption\" because the rainbow candy contained a \"known toxin\" – an artificial color additive called titanium dioxide.\n\nIn a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday, Justin Comes, vice president of research and development for Skittles maker Mars Wrigley North America, said the company couldn't comment on pending litigation – but that its use of titanium dioxide and \"all Mars Wrigley ingredients are safe and manufactured in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements established by food safety regulators, including the FDA.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in a wide range of food products and consumer goods – from candy to sunscreen and house paint. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide, specifically as a color additive in food, is safe under some restrictions.\n\nHowever, some experts and food regulators in other countries disagree – pointing to potential, serious health consequences and rising concerns about the additive. Starting August 7, for example, the use of titanium dioxide in food will be banned in the European Union.\n\nHere's what you need to know about titanium dioxide:\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nWhat is titanium dioxide? Why is it used in food products?\n\nTitanium dioxide, or TiO2, sometimes referred to as E171, is an inorganic, solid substance used in a wide range of consumer goods including cosmetics, paint, plastic and food, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nIn food, titanium dioxide is often used as an artificial color additive. Tasha Stoiber, senior scientist at the consumer health nonprofit Environmental Working Group, says titanium dioxide can generally be thought of as a \"paint primer\" – it often goes on a hard-shelled candy like Skittles before the color is added to give it a \"uniform shine.\"\n\nTitanium dioxide \"can also be found in dairy products to make them whiter and brighter … like frosting or cottage cheese,\" Stoiber told USA TODAY, adding that the additive is used in other products – such as food or beverage instant mixes – as an anti-caking agent.\n\nPhthalates on the fast-food menu: Chemicals linked to health problems found at McDonalds, Taco Bell\n\nTitanium dioxide is used in an enormous range of food products, which can feel jarring when looking at some of its other uses.\n\n\"It's sort of ironic, maybe ironic is the wrong word, that the ingredient in paint that makes your kitchen shiny also makes your Hostess cupcakes shiny,\" Environmental Working Group's senior vice president of government affairs Scott Faber added.\n\nIs titanium dioxide dangerous? Has it been linked to any health issues?\n\nWhile the FDA maintains that the regulated use of titanium dioxide is safe, the European Food Safety Authority and some other experts warn of potential, serious health risks.\n\nMost notably, a European Food Safety Authority safety assessment published in May 2021 pointed to genotoxicity concerns, as suggested by previous research. Genotoxicity is the ability of chemicals to damage genetic information such as DNA, which may lead to cancer.\n\n\"After oral ingestion, the absorption of titanium dioxide particles is low, however they can accumulate in the body,\" Maged Younes, chair of the European Food Safety Authority's expert Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings, said in a May 2021 statement.\n\nCan cancer patients skip post-surgery chemo? New research says some may be able to.\n\nThe authority did not identify a safe amount of titanium dioxide that could be consumed.\n\nMatthew Wright, chair of the authority's working group on titanium dioxide, noted that \"the evidence for general toxic effects was not conclusive,\" but that the panel couldn't rule out genotoxicity entirely. There were also some current data limitations and the assessment \"could not establish a safe level for daily intake of the food additive,\" he stated.\n\nWhat other candies and food contain titanium dioxide?\n\nIt's hard to determine the total amount of food products that have titanium dioxide because federal regulations don't require all producers to list its use on ingredient labels, but the list of foods containing the substance certainly doesn't end with Skittles.\n\nOf the products that include the additive in their labels, Thea Bourianne, senior manager at data consultant Label Insights, told Food Navigator USA in May 2021 that more than 11,000 products in the company's database of U.S. food and beverage products listed titanium dioxide as an ingredient. Non-chocolate candy led those numbers at 32%. Cupcakes and snack cakes made up 14%, followed by cookies at 8%, coated pretzels and trail mix at 7%, baking decorations at 6%, gum and mints at 4% and ice cream at 2%.\n\nFood recalls: Some Jif peanut butter products recalled over salmonella outbreak concerns\n\nIn addition to Skittles, other candies that contain titanium dioxide include Nice! mints, Trolli sour gummies and Ring Pops, according to Environmental Working Group.\n\nOther food products that list titanium dioxide are Lucerne cottage cheese, Beyond Meat's chicken plant-based tenders, Great Value ice cream and Chips Ahoy! cookies.\n\nWhat is the FDA limit for titanium dioxide?\n\nThe FDA's Code of Federal Regulations allows for the legal, regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products, under some restrictions.\n\n\"The FDA continues to allow for the safe use of titanium dioxide as a color additive in foods generally according to the specifications and conditions, including that the quantity of titanium dioxide does not exceed 1% by weight of the food,\" the FDA said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nThe FDA first approved the use of titanium dioxide in food in 1966, following its 1960 removal (along with the removal of other color additives) from the agency's original \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" list. In 1977, titanium dioxide joined the list of color additives that are exempt from certification, which means \"titanium dioxide\" doesn't have to be listed on the packaging of every product it's used in, Faber noted.\n\n\"There are many uses of titanium dioxide that we don't know about because they were made exempt from being on the package in 1977,\" said Faber, who added that \"nothing much has changed\" since – other than the FDA approving some other uses of the color additive, such as expanding the use of mica-based pearlescent pigments (prepared from titanium dioxide) as color additives in distilled spirits over recent years.\n\nFaber argued there hasn't been enough change in these federal regulations in the decades following the FDA's approval of titanium dioxide – especially as others increasingly point to potential health consequences.\n\n\"What titanium dioxide is really emblematic of ... is the failure of FDA to look back at these old decisions and ask whether its decisions that were made in this case ... 56 years ago (in the 1966 approval) still hold up,\" he said.\n\nIn its statement to USA TODAY, the FDA maintained that, in all post-approvals for food additives, \"our scientists continue to review relevant new information to determine whether there are safety questions and whether the use of such substance is no longer safe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"\n\nWhen asked about the recent Skittles lawsuit, the FDA said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nIs titanium dioxide illegal in other countries?\n\nThough the regulated use of titanium dioxide in food products is legal in the U.S. and Canada, it's banned in some other countries, notably throughout Europe. In May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority announced that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered safe as a food additive.\"\n\nFollowing six months of phasing out the additive, titanium dioxide will be completely banned in the European Union starting August 7. France had previously banned the use of titanium dioxide in food starting in January 2020.\n\nHow can I tell if a product has titanium dioxide in it? How can I avoid the ingredient?\n\nSome food products will include titanium dioxide on their nutrition label. But again, it can be hard to tell for those who don't list the ingredient.\n\nIf you want to avoid titanium dioxide, Stoiber and Faber urge consumers to try and avoid processed foods as best as you can.\n\n\"By reducing processed foods in your diet, you can reduce the likelihood of not only eating titanium dioxide but eating other chemicals of concern,\" Faber said, noting that consumers can also call their elected representatives urging them to support increased food safety legislation and take action with organization alliances like Toxic Free Food FDA. \"America, once again, is falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to chemical safety.\"\n\n\"We're not only just concerned about titanium dioxide, there's a whole host of other food additives that also have known harmful health risks associated with them as well,\" Stoiber added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/costco-kirkland-signature-trader-joes-store-brands", "title": "The hidden makers of Costco's Kirkland Signature and Trader Joe's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nKirkland Signature. Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry.

Any bill approved by the Senate would have to clear the House, which is in recess the last week of June.\n\n“We are still negotiating, and I think we’re getting much closer,” Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., told reporters. “We have to act. We can’t allow this to happen on the first of July with the Vermont labeling law.”\n\nRoberts said there are still “several areas of disagreement” but he declined to say what they were. Asked if he expected a deal before July, he responded: “I sure as hell hope so.”\n\nSen.

At that time, they would be fined $1,000 for each day a product isn't properly labeled.\n\nAs the Vermont deadline has approached, several food companies, including candy-maker Mars, General Mills, Kellogg, ConAgra and Campbell Soup, have announced their own GMO labels.\n\n\"They are using July 1 to try to force congressional action,\" said Scott Faber, a vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. \"It's not hard to imagine a simple disclosure that does not stigmatize this technology, but that allows consumers to make their own decisions.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the debate in Washington has centered on a push by the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food and other groups that favor QR codes, websites or 1-800 numbers that consumers can use to find out more information. Proponents of mandatory labeling, including the Environmental Working Group, say these practices wouldn't be effective. They instead favor wording right on the product.\n\nStudy finds genetically engineered foods are safe\n\nFood and agricultural groups warned Thursday of “chaos” in the marketplace and said a failure to finish and pass legislation could have costly and long-lasting challenges for farmers, food manufacturers and consumers.\n\n“We believe the discussions (between Roberts and Stabenow) have moved to a point that has been described as 'within inches,' ” Chuck Conner, president and chief executive office of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, said in a conference call. “We need a win here. We need them to finish.”\n\nFarm groups expressed concern that without a deal, more companies could decide to reformulate their products to avoid the Vermont law. The result would be lower demand for U.S. GMO crops, further hurting farmers already dealing with sluggish commodity prices.\n\n“The lack of Senate action … will have serious negative consequences for our nation’s farmers,” said Steve Censky, chief executive of the American Soybean Association. “Markets for the crops that our farmers are growing today will be lost, and value of farmers’ crops will be diminished.”\n\nContact Christopher Doering at cdoering@usatoday.com or reach him at Twitter: @cdoering", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/04/02/companies-begin-embracing-gmo-labeling/82267542/", "title": "Companies begin embracing GMO labeling", "text": "Christopher Doering\n\ncdoering@gannett.com\n\nWASHINGTON — More food companies are voluntarily disclosing if their products contain genetically modified ingredients, the latest sign that consumer groups may be gaining ground in their campaign to get a nationwide mandatory label.\n\nIn just the past few weeks, candy-maker Mars, General Mills, Kellogg and ConAgra all announced they would be voluntarily labeling their products. They joined Campbell Soup, which became the first major food company to disclose the presence of genetically engineered organisms in January.\n\nFood executives say they have no choice but to include the ingredients on labels, citing growing pressure from consumers to know what’s in their food, a failure by Congress to adopt a nationwide standard, and the fact that Vermont on July 1 becomes the first state to require labeling.\n\nThose who follow the ongoing debate expect other food manufacturers to follow suit with their own labels or risk losing out in the fiercely competitive industry.\n\nWith these “companies starting to do it, it will create a real responsibility for other companies to start mentioning (them). They will have to start indicating where their ingredients come from,” said Sophie Ann Terrisse, a senior adviser with brand-management firm 26FIVE in New York. “They won’t have a choice.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

It also plays a pivotal role in helping them distinguish their products from competitors, she said.\n\n“This is all about this consumer discussion and creating trust for those brands. By communicating that they have GMO ingredients, it is about transparency. 'You can trust us. We’re going to tell you what's in our product,'\" said Terrisse.\n\nCompanies that overhaul their label now, rather than wait, not only benefit by earning the trust of their customers, but they can potentially have a larger influence over how future state labels will look, food companies said.\n\nBy putting a label on their products that reflects the Vermont law, they increase the likelihood that other states will adopt a similar label. This lessens the chance that multiple state labels will be rolled out with varying requirements that can be costly for companies.\n\nScott Faber, Environmental Working Group's vice president for government affairs, said the decision by food giants to label their products indicates the \"ground is shifting\" and \"time is running out\" for Congress to act before the Vermont law takes effect. He said the new labels further squelch the argument that a mandatory label would lead to higher costs for food companies that they would pass on to consumers.\n\n“We’re optimistic that Congress will find a national solution, and we’re thrilled that companies are willing to provide consumers with the basic facts and not waiting for Congress to act,” Faber said. \"It's good news for consumers that they'll get the right to know.\"\n\nUp to 80 percent of packaged foods contain ingredients that have been genetically modified, according to the food industry. Biotech crops are popular in agricultural states such as Iowa, where more than 90 percent of corn and soybeans come from the seeds.\n\n'Consumer confusion'\n\nThe Vermont law requires packages to have the words “produced with” or “partially produced with” genetically engineered ingredients printed on the label. The requirement would only apply to products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, meaning meat and poultry overseen by the Agriculture Department would not be covered.\n\nIn the case of Campbell Soup's SpaghettiOs, for example, the original variety handled by the FDA will need a label, but SpaghettiOs with meatballs, covered by the USDA, will be exempt.\n\n”These two varieties sit next to each other on a store shelf, which is bound to create consumer confusion,” said Denise Morrison, Campbell’s chief executive, when the company introduced its GMO label.\n\nOpponents of mandatory labeling have routinely touted a Corn Refiners Association study that estimated Vermont’s law could increase the price of groceries for families by nearly $1,050 a year. Consumers Union and other organizations said the corn group “drastically overstates” the impact, putting it closer to $2.30 per person annually.\n\nCongress' inaction\n\nLast month, the Senate failed to advance a bill banning states from establishing their own GMO labeling laws. It would have created a voluntary program where producers could put “smart labels” on their products that allow consumers to find out more nutrition and ingredient information online or by calling a toll-free number.\n\nSen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, failed to attract enough Democratic support by giving the food industry three years to bring 70 percent of its products into compliance or the Agriculture Department would be allowed to make the labeling requirement mandatory. He vowed to work on the bill when Congress returns this week from its spring break.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was not optimistic Congress could reach a deal before Vermont's law takes effect this summer.\n\n“It’s going to be very difficult to get such a bipartisan agreement, and I wouldn’t be surprised that what you are going to find (is) some food companies that think the business for 600,000 people in Vermont is probably not worth it, and they’ll quit doing business there,” Grassley said.\n\nCost and trust issues\n\nHerr Foods, a Pennsylvania producer of potato chips, pretzels and popcorn, is among those companies considering pulling its products from Vermont if the law goes into effect.\n\n\"It's a very big decision to make,\" said Bob Clark, Herr's vice president of marketing. \"We have to consider everything because it's a very huge expense to\" change labels across all our products to comply with the Vermont law.\n\nTracy Boever, director of public relations and marketing communications with Jolly Time in Sioux City, Ia., said the popcorn maker added a non-GMO label to its products two years ago because so many customers were calling to ask if their products had the ingredients. Unlike most corn, all popcorn is GMO-free.\n\nThe decision, she said, has been closely watched by shoppers and draws comments from people on social media who say Jolly Time is their favorite popcorn because it's non-GMO.\n\n“At the store shelf when the consumer is making that decision and they see right on our package ‘Non GMO,’ I think that definitely helps” attract people to our brand, Boever said.\n\nCampbell Soup, which also makes its namesake soups, V8 and Pepperidge Farm cookies, was the first to buck the rest of the industry by pushing for a mandatory national label. The food maker decided late last year to move forward with the label change following months of research and feedback from consumers, said Mark Alexander, a president with the company.\n\nWhile Campbell Soup expects to incur some cost with new labels, many of which are already being shipped to supermarkets across the country, he said it’s not significant enough that it would have to hike prices.\n\n“We believe that by being out front and by being the most transparent food company, that we will earn very strong levels of consumer trust, which will obviously benefit our business over time,” Alexander said. \"We're not doing this out of legal compliance. We're doing this because we believe in the consumer's right to know.\"\n\n'We can't wait any longer'\n\nAt General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios, Old El Paso and Chex, the company delayed work on other projects to focus attention on its GMO label. While the company still backs a national standard, it felt it had no choice but to make the change now.\n\n“We can’t wait any longer with the Vermont law taking effect soon,” said Mike Siemienas, a spokesman with General Mills. “We made the decision to use the Vermont labeling everywhere in the country — not because we want to or because we think it’s a great tool to inform or educate consumers, but because a national standard doesn’t exist and we face fines if we don’t comply.”\n\nA business failing to comply with the Vermont law would get hit with a $1,000 fine each day for every product that is not properly labeled.\n\nChad Hart, an Iowa State University agricultural economist, said food makers have been watching closely to see whether the Vermont law would be struck down by a court or whether Congress would pass legislation.\n\n“They waited hoping action would happen somewhere else. It’s not necessarily cheap to change these labels,” he said. “With neither one of those looking like they’re going to happen anytime real soon, now companies are figuring out we’re going to have to deal with the Vermont law.”\n\nThe Grocery Manufacturers Association, which backs a voluntary law and opposes individual state laws they contend would be too costly, has challenged the Vermont measure in federal court. A request for a preliminary injunction to block the law was denied; the trade group has appealed.\n\n“One small state’s law is setting labeling standards for consumers across the country,” said GMA, which represents food and beverage companies.\n\nContact Christopher Doering at cdoering@usatoday.com or reach him at Twitter: @cdoering", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/14/chobani-playing-hardball-highly-competitive-yogurt-industry-dannon-general-mills/78689100/", "title": "Chobani, yogurt competitors slug it out over advertising", "text": "David Hill\n\ndwhill@gannett.com | @NY_newsguy_Hill\n\nFor a company built on a smooth and creamy product, Chobani Greek yogurt is playing rough with its advertising.\n\nChobani LLC began an ad campaign last week promoting its Simply 100 line of 100-calorie packages of Greek yogurt as the only truly natural major brand on the market. The ads are directly aimed at products made by two big food corporations that rolled out Greek-style yogurt after Chobani took sales away from their conventionally made yogurt and grew to become one of central New York's best agribusiness successes.\n\nIts original factory, a former conventional dairy plant new New Berlin, is among Chenango County's largest employers with about 1,000 people, and has provided a new market for the region's dairy farms.\n\nThe new ads criticize both Yoplait 100 Greek Yogurt, made by General Mills, and Dannon Light & Fit, owned by the French food company Danone.\n\nOne version notes that the Yoplait ingredients list includes potassium sorbate, a mold inhibitor that is approved for food use by federal regulators but which the ads link to “stuff used to kill bugs.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nThe Dannon yogurt, the Chobani ads note, include the sweetener sucralose, also federally approved but which Chobani says is processed with chlorine. One ad depicts a woman reading the ingredients list then tossing the Dannon package into a swimming pool presumably treated with chlorine.\n\nDannon wrote to Chobani demanding it stop the Simply 100 ad campaign, defending sucralose as proven safe.\n\nGeneral Mills, the giant food company known for its breakfast cereals, went to court in Minneapolis, seeking an injunction against the ads and repayment for damage to its brand. The company invoked a federal law against deceptive or outright false advertising claims against other products, noting that potassium sorbate is used to prevent yeast and mold in food, just as it’s used to control fungi on crops.\n\nChobani then filed the papers in the Syracuse-based U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York asking for the declaration that its ads are not false, misleading, disparaging or deceptive. It also sent out a press release announcing its action against Dannon and depicting the ads as simply informing yogurt buyers.\n\n“Consumers have the right to know what's in their cup,” said Chobani chief marketing and brand officer Peter McGuinness. “This campaign is fundamentally about choice — the choice between natural ingredients versus artificial ingredients.\"\n\nHe added: \"While I'm not surprised, I'm disappointed that Dannon and General Mills are focused on stopping people from having the facts about artificial sweeteners and artificial preservatives. This campaign is about giving people truthful and accurate information so they can make more informed decisions about the food they buy.\"\n\nChobani' was founded by Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish immigrant who was making feta cheese when he got a Small Business Administration loan and bought an old dairy plant in South Edmeston and began making the thicker style of yogurt. Chobani shipped its first order in 2007 and in 2011 declared itself the leading yogurt brand in the United States.\n\nThe New York-based firm has since opened a major plant in Idaho and has been rolling out other lines, including single-serving yogurts made with chocolate, oats and other grains, and Flip, where add-ins like nuts, peanut butter and even Sriracha hot sauce and mango are in a compartment separate from the yogurt.\n\nThe fight with General Mills and Dannon is a new battle in an old war over whose products are the most old-school authentic, said Andrew Novakovic, the E.V. Baker Professor of Agricultural Economics at Cornell University and an expert in dairy markets and marketing. Yoplait and Dannon fought back after Chobani took sales from the conventional-yogurt brands, the big companies rolling out their own Greek-style products made with a different process, and now they're fighting a war over who is making the more old-school product, Novakovic said.\n\nOne strategy is to offer indulgent products for consumption more as a dessert than breakfast or lunch. Another strategy focuses on consumers concerned with health and food additives, Novakovic added. Whether potassium sorbate and sucralose are unhealthy is not the point as much as having a \"clean label\" without chemical names and that certain consumers notice, he said.\n\n“This is about expanding the size of the market and recognizing that you've got to come up with new uses or new customers or both. It is also about fighting for market shares among intense competitors,” Novakovic said.\n\n\"“Something like potassium sorbate would be seen as a negative by anyone focused on a clean label, but that doesn't mean it is dangerous. Moreover, there is no legal definition of what is 'natural' or what isn't. So the test of that claim is basically evaluated in the court of public opinion. “\n\nThe attention comes as many business media reported in the fall that Chobani was seeking outside investors to take a minority stake in the company and provide money for expansion. Some articles said Coca-Cola and Pepsi Co. were interested, but nothing has been announced and later articles said those companies were no longer interested.\n\nChobani was also the target of a 2014 trademark-infringement suit by a business-ethics consultant claiming its campaign about how yogurt is made matters violated his use of the word \"how.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2015/04/20/neil-young-play-first-show-vermont/26004383/", "title": "Neil Young plans concert in Vermont", "text": "Brent Hallenbeck\n\nFree Press Staff Writer\n\nRock legend Neil Young will perform July 19 at the Champlain Valley Exposition, South Burlington-based concert presenter Higher Ground announced this morning.\n\nYoung will play his first Vermont headlining gig at the Essex Junction fairgrounds with Promise of the Real, which includes Lukas and Micah Nelson.

Starbucks responded to Young's website post by saying the coffee company \"is not a part of any lawsuit pertaining to GMO labeling\" and \"is not aligned with Monsanto to stop food labeling or block Vermont State law.\"\n\nOne clue that the GMO-labeling law may have influenced Young to play in Vermont is that his next album, recorded with Promise of the Real, is a politically and ecologically inspired work titled \"The Monsanto Years,\" named for the chemical company that produces genetically modified seeds.

And a group that advocates for plant-based products, the Good Food Institute, countered by asking the Food and Drug Administration this week to say foods can use terms such as “milk” and “sausage,” so long as they’re modified to make clear what’s in them.\n\nIt’s the latest dispute about what qualifies a food as authentic, many of them stemming from developments in manufacturing practices and specialized diets.\n\nRelated:\n\nDetroit named North America's top 'unexpected' food city by Nat Geo\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nBugs for dinner? Detroit's newest food trend has wings\n\nDiGiorno’s frozen chicken “wyngz” were fodder for comedian Stephen Colbert. An eggless, vegan spread provoked the ire of egg producers by calling itself “mayo.” And as far back as the 1880s, margarine was dismissed as “counterfeit butter” by a Wisconsin lawmaker.\n\nThe U.S. actually spells out the required characteristics for a range of products such as French dressing, canned peas and raisin bread. It’s these federal standards of identity that often trigger the food fights.\n\nCOW, NUT, BEAN\n\nThough soy milk and almond milk have become commonplace terms, milk’s standard of identity says it is obtained by the “complete milking of one or more healthy cows.” That’s a point the dairy industry is now emphasizing, with the support of lawmakers who last month introduced legislation calling for the FDA to enforce the guidelines.\n\n“Mammals produce milk, plants don’t,” said Jim Mulhern, president of the National Milk Producers Federation.\n\nThe federation says it has been trying to get the FDA to enforce the standard since at least 2000 , and that the lack of enforcement has led to a proliferation of imitators playing “fast and loose” with dairy terms.\n\nThose products often refer to themselves as “soymilk” or “almondmilk,” single words that the dairy industry says is a way to get around the guidelines for “milk.”\n\nThe Plant Based Foods Association, which represents companies like Tofurky and milk alternatives, says standards of identity were created to prevent companies from passing off cheaper ingredients on customers. But the group says that’s not what soy, almond and rice milk makers are trying to do.\n\n“Those companies are charging more money, because consumers are gravitating toward them,” said Michele Simon, the group’s executive director.\n\nThe FDA says it takes action “in accordance with public health priorities and agency resources.”\n\nEDIBLE, BUT EGGLESS\n\nThe little-known Association for Dressing and Sauces showed its might in a 2014 mayonnaise melee.\n\nThe group repeatedly complained to the FDA that an eggless spread was calling itself Just Mayo, noting that under the federal rules mayonnaise is defined as having eggs.\n\nHellmann’s mayonnaise maker Unilever, one of the association’s members, had sued Just Mayo’s maker citing the same issue. That lawsuit was dropped after the company faced blowback from the vegan spread’s supporters.\n\nThe dressings and sauces group wasn’t the only one upset by Just Mayo’s name. The CEO of the American Egg Board, which represents the egg industry, also tried unsuccessfully to get a consultant to stop the sale of Just Mayo at Whole Foods.\n\nThe revelations led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Soon after, the egg industry group’s CEO retired earlier than expected.\n\nAs for Just Mayo, the company worked out an agreement with the FDA to keep its name — with some strategic tweaks to its label to make clear it does not contain eggs.\n\nSTRAINING FOR YOGURT\n\nIt was a milk protein concentrate at issue in a lawsuit over Yoplait Greek.\n\nThat ingredient isn’t listed in the FDA’s standard of identity for yogurt. What’s more, the suit said General Mills relied on the ingredient to thicken its yogurt, rather than straining it the way other Greek yogurts are made.\n\n“Not only was it not Greek yogurt, it wasn’t yogurt at all,” said Brian Gudmundson, the Minnesota lawyer who filed the suit.\n\nThe case was ultimately dismissed by the judge, who said the matter would be better handled by the FDA. Gudmundson said he reached out to the agency afterward, but nothing came of it.\n\nYoplait Greek’s maker, General Mills, says it has since made recipe changes to its yogurts and it no longer uses milk protein concentrate in Yoplait Greek. The company had also noted in legal filings that the FDA said during a seminar that milk protein concentrate could be used in yogurt.\n\nIn 2002, the presence of milk protein concentrate in Kraft Singles was also called out in a warning letter from the FDA, which noted the ingredient was not listed as an ingredient in the definition for “pasteurized process cheese food.” Kraft now labels the Singles as a “pasteurized prepared cheese product.”\n\nWYNGZ, NOT WINGS\n\n“Wyngz” scored a high-profile TV appearance not long after DiGiorno launched frozen meals with pizza and the boneless chicken pieces in 2011.\n\n“The Colbert Show” called the spelling out as a “government-mandated” way to get around the fact that they’re not made of wing meat. Colbert cited a page on the USDA’s website that said the odd spelling could be used for a product that is “in the shape of a wing or a bite-size appetizer type product,” but not made entirely from wing meat.\n\n“No other misspellings are permitted,” the website says.\n\nThe story behind the USDA declaration remains a bit of a mystery. DiGiorno owner Nestle said it wanted to call the boneless chicken pieces “wings,” since it believes people understand that “boneless wings” are not whole wings. The company says the USDA instead proposed “wyngz.”\n\nNestle proudly noted that it believes it was the first, and perhaps only, company to approach the USDA with an issue that led to the “wyngz” determination.\n\nThe USDA says a company had made the request to use the word to describe a product, and did not elaborate.\n\n“COUNTERFEIT BUTTER”\n\nIt’s not just soy and almond milk that have drawn the ire of the dairy industry. In 1886, dairy producers supported a federal tax on margarine, which was dubbed “counterfeit butter” by representative William Price of Wisconsin, a major dairy state. In 1902, that law was amended to increase the tax on margarine dyed to look like butter, says Ai Hisano, a business historian at the Harvard Business School.\n\nSome states went so far as to prohibit the sale of dyed margarine, which was naturally white. Hence a vintage ad that declares Parkay margarine “Golden Yellow and ready to spread!” — with an asterisk noting, “in 26 states .”\n\nTo get around state bans, Hisano said margarine makers provided yellow solution capsules so people could dye the margarine themselves.\n\nFast forward to today, and food identity more broadly remains a polarizing topic.\n\nGroups such as the dairy federation say federal standards of identity ensure people get what they expect from products labeled with terms such as “milk.” Animal rights advocates who support plant-based alternatives question whether the standards of identity remain relevant. Matt Penzer, an attorney for the Humane Society of the United States, said some standards are outdated, but are being used by the established players to fend off competition and innovation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/12/22/new-label-law-has-unintended-effect-as-bakers-add-sesame-to-more-foods/69749488007/", "title": "New label law has unintended effect as bakers add sesame to more ...", "text": "JONEL ALECCIA\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nA new federal law requiring that sesame be listed as an allergen on food labels is having unintended consequences — increasing the number of products with the ingredient.\n\nFood industry experts said the requirements are so stringent that many manufacturers, especially bakers, find it simpler and less expensive to add sesame to a product — and to label it — than to try to keep it away from other foods or equipment with sesame.\n\nAs a result, several companies — including national restaurant chains like Olive Garden, Wendy’s and Chick-fil-A and bread makers that stock grocery shelves and serve schools — are adding sesame to products that didn’t have it before. While the practice is legal, consumers and advocates say it violates the spirit of the law aimed at making foods safer for people with allergies.\n\n“It was really exciting as a policy advocate and a mom to get these labels,” said Naomi Seiler, a consultant with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America whose 9-year-old daughter, Zoe, is allergic to sesame. “Instead, companies are intentionally adding the allergen to food.”\n\nThe new law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, requires that all foods made and sold in the U.S. must be labeled if they contain sesame, which is now the nation's ninth major allergen. Sesame can be found in obvious places, like sesame seeds on hamburger buns. But it is also an ingredient in many foods from protein bars to ice cream, added to sauces, dips and salad dressings and hidden in spices and flavorings.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nAdvocates for families coping with allergies lobbied for years to have sesame added to the list of major allergens. Congress in 2004 created labeling requirements for eight: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans.\n\nMore than 1.6 million people in the U.S. are allergic to sesame, some so severe that they need injections of epinephrine, a drug used to treat life-threatening reactions. Cases of sesame allergy have been rising in recent years along with a growing number of foods that contain the ingredient, said Dr. Ruchi Gupta, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Food Allergy & Asthma Research at Northwestern University.\n\n“Sesame is in so many things that people don’t really understand,” said Gupta, who called the move to add sesame to products “so disappointing.”\n\n“In families that do have a sesame allergy, it is truly challenging,” she said.\n\nUnder the new law, enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, companies must now explicitly label sesame as an ingredient or separately note that a product contains sesame. In the U.S., ingredients are listed on product packaging in order of amount. Sesame labeling has been required for years in other places, including Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIf the ingredients don't include sesame, companies must take steps to prevent the foods from coming in contact with any sesame, known as cross-contamination.\n\nFood industry experts said the new requirements aren’t simple or practical.\n\n“It’s as if we’ve suddenly asked bakers to go to the beach and remove all the sand,” said Nathan Mirdamadi, a consultant with Commercial Food Sanitation, which advises the industry about food safety.\n\nSome companies include statements on labels that say a food “may contain” a certain product or that the food is “produced in a facility” that also uses certain allergens. However, such statements are voluntary, not required, according to the FDA, and they do not absolve the company of requirements to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nInstead, some companies have taken a different approach. Officials at Olive Garden said that starting this week, the chain is adding “a minimal amount of sesame flour” to the company’s famous breadsticks “due to the potential for cross-contamination at the bakery.”\n\nChick-fil-A has changed its white bun and multigrain brioche buns to include sesame, while Wendy’s said the company has added sesame to its French toast sticks and buns.\n\nUnited States Bakery, which operates Franz Family Bakeries in California and the Northwest, notified customers in March that they would add a small amount of sesame flour to all hamburger and hot dog buns and rolls “to mitigate the risk of any adverse reactions to sesame products.”\n\nAlthough such actions don’t violate the law, the FDA “does not support” them, the agency said in a statement.\n\n“It would make it more difficult for sesame allergic customers to find foods that are safe for them to consume,” the statement said.\n\nSome large companies previously have added other allergens to products and updated their labels. In 2016, Kellogg's added traces of peanut flour to some cookies and crackers, prompting protests.\n\nThat’s frustrating and scary for parents like Kristy Fitzgerald of Crookston, Minnesota. She learned last spring that Pan-O-Gold Baking Co., which supplies breads to schools, health centers and grocery stores across the Midwest, was adding small amounts of sesame to its products, including those served at her daughter's school. Six-year-old Audrey, in the meantime, has outgrown her allergy to sesame.\n\nBob Huebner, food safety/quality assurance manager for Pan-O-Gold, told Fitzgerald in a string of emails that the company was forced to add sesame to the product and the label.\n\n“The unfortunate reality is that our equipment and bakeries are not setup for allergen cleanings that would be required to prevent sesame cross-contamination and was not an option for us,” Huebner wrote in an email to Fitzgerald. Huebner replied to an email from the AP but did not respond to questions about the company's practices.\n\nFitzgerald started an online petition protesting the move to add sesame.\n\n“At some point, someone is going to feed an allergic child sesame,” Fitzgerald said. “It makes me think the laws need to change to show that this is not an acceptable practice.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}]}

She was 91. Goodall died of natural causes in California during a speaking tour across the United States.\n\nGoodall had influence on the world, and the Reno-Tahoe area was no exception. From speaking to students at the Lake Tahoe School in Incline Village in 2019 to visiting a U.S. Wolf Refuge in North Reno in 2022 and even inspiring art at Burning Man, Goodall left her mark in Northern Nevada.\n\nThe Reno-Tahoe area also had an impact on Goodall's work. Allen Gardner and his wife, Beatrix \"Trixie\" Gardner, of Reno became famous for pioneering research in the field of interspecies communication when they first began teaching American Sign Language to Washoe the chimpanzee in the 1960s.\n\n\"Project Washoe\" eventually expanded to include four other chimps — Moja, Pili, Tatu and Dar. This project eventually gained the attention of Goodall and other primate experts.\n\nWho was Jane Goodall?\n\nBorn in London in 1934, Goodall had a fascination with animals from a young age. In 1957, she traveled to Kenya where she met Louis Leakey, a Kenyan and British paleontologist and archaeologist whose fossil digs ultimately helped establish that humans evolved in Africa.\n\nGoodall became his secretary and eventually joined him on a field expedition studying chimpanzees on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in what is now Gombe National Park in Tanzania.\n\nThere she observed chimpanzees using grass stems to pull termites out out of their mounds for food, which shattered the mainstream scientific belief that only humans made and used tools and is \"considered one of the greatest achievements of twentieth-century scholarship,\" according to the Jane Goodall Institute.\n\nThe National Geographic Society funded more of Goodall's chimpanzee research and sent along cameraman, Hugo van Lawick, to document her efforts. Goodall and van Lawick later married in March 1964, and the documentary, \"Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees,\" released in 1965, attracted an estimated 25 million viewers in North America upon its first broadcast on CBS.\n\nGoodall parlayed her popularity into books, more documentaries and continued expansion of research into chimpanzees.\n\nIn 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, helping continue the long-running study of chimpanzees in the Gombe and boost conservation efforts for other species around the globe. Its Roots & Shoots program, established in 1991, also engages young people in local efforts to protect animals and the environment.\n\n\"Every single day we live, we make some sort of impact on the world. Most of us can choose what sort of impact we make,\" Goodall told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, during a stop on her speaking tour in September. \"Hope isn't wishful thinking. I tell people, 'Find something you can do in your community. Do it. Get your friends to support you. See that you can make a difference. Know that all around the world, other people like you are making a difference.'\"\n\nGoodall, a United Nations Messenger of Peace, was appointed a Dame of the British Empire in 2003 and awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/08/28/indianapolis-zoo-announces-39-nominees-for-coveted-2014-conservation-award/2712765/", "title": "2014 Indianapolis Prize nominees announced", "text": "By Shari Rudavsky\n\nshari.rudavsky@indystar.com\n\nThe Indianapolis Zoo today announced 39 nominees for its 2014 coveted Indianapolis Prize, an award that comes with the Lilly Medal, a $250,000 purse and priceless dose of status.\n\nThis year's field, the largest of qualified nominees that the zoo has seen since it first awarded the prize in 2006, includes those who study orangutans, tigers, swans and bats as well as many more members of the animal kingdom.\n\nOne of the prime goals of zoo officials when they devised the prize more than eight years ago was to provide future winners a platform from which to advocate for their causes.\n\n\"There's now pretty much a universal understanding in conservation circles that the Indianapolis Prize is the Nobel Prize of animal conservation,\" said Michael Crowther, president and CEO of Indianapolis Zoo. \"If you're a wildlife conservationist, you want to win this thing.\"\n\nThe money doesn't hurt either. This year for the first time, the prize, which is supported in large part by the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, has increased to $250,000 in recognition of the fact the original $100,000 didn't go that far, Crowther said.\n\nIn addition, for the first time this year, the five finalists will receive $10,000. A nominating committee of nine will whittle down the nearly 40 names to six by February. Another group, the jury, will choose the winner, who will be announced in June.\n\nSteven Amstrup of Polar Bears International, last year's winner, still cannot get over that he got the call.\n\n\"Winning the Indianapolis Prize was the most humbling experience in my career,\" he said. \"That additional recognition translates into a little taller pulpit that I can use to deliver my message.\"\n\nThis prize likely led to another honor, Amstrup said, the \"Our Earth\" award at the Bambi Awards, a German version of the Oscars. Aside from the added cachet that brought, said Amstrup, it's likely the only time in his life he will share a stage with Celine Dion.\n\nAs for the money, Amstrup has donated some. Some has gone to offset the the unpaid work that does for his organization, from which he receives a part-time salary.\n\nBy not restricting the use of funds, the prize allows winners to use their imaginations, Crowther said. Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who won the award in 2010 for his work with Save the Elephants, used part of his money to open a healthcare clinic near his elephant-watch camp in Kenya, something he would never have been able to do with a traditional grant. The clinic, however, helped him win over locals to his cause — and improve their health.\n\nSuch efforts may seem far removed from the grounds of the Indianapolis Zoo, but that's precisely what zoo officials envisioned when they pitched the idea of a prize to the Lilly Foundation.\n\n\"If we were going to have the impact we thought we could, we needed to develop new programs to make our efforts work harder and have greater leverage and the prize has played a major role in that,\" Crowther said.\n\nThis year's list of nominees has something for every type of animal lover.\n\nHave a soft spot for dolphins? Nominee Randall Wells of the Chicago Zoological Society also runs the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, the longest-running study of wild dolphins.\n\nPerhaps you prefer land animals like snow leopards? Two of the nominees, Attaullah Pandrani of Save the Nature Organization and Rodney Jackson of the Snow Leopard Conservancy, work with this endangered animal.\n\nWinged creatures catch your fancy? You might like the work of Amanda Lollar, who established the Bat World Sanctuary in Mineral Wells, Texas, or Helen Hays of the American Museum of Natural History who works with roseate terns on Great Gull Island in New York's Long Island Sound.\n\nMany of the nominees have been through it before. Jackson of the Snow Leopard Conservancy has been a finalist every year but the first one that the prize was offered.\n\nThis prize, he says, is unparalleled in the field of conservation.\n\n\"This is by far the most significant prize in terms of the amount of funds it brings with it, the prestige it brings and the outreach that it has,\" said Jackson, who has been conducting radio tracking studies of snow leopards for three decades. \"There are other prizes here and there ... but this really is a prize that's focused on conservation action in the field for the endangered species of the world.\"\n\nA number of species could use the increased attention that winning the prize bestows on a cause, many of the nominees agree.\n\nOrangutans, for instance, teeter on the verge of extinction, said Biruté Mary Galdikas, a nominee who has studied this primate for 42 years. The rise of palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia are destroying the orangutan's natural habitat.\n\nWhen she first started studying the animal, she was working with one population of about 6,000 individuals. At the time this population was not large or prominent. But because she protected this group as others were wiped out, today it is one of largest orangutan populations in the world.\n\n\"It has gotten so much worse,\" said Galdikas, founder and president of the Orangutan Foundation International. \"I feel like my organization and I have just been putting our finger into the dyke while the water splashes over us.\"\n\nA $250,000 award could go to many programs, Galdikas said, such as setting up patrols to guard orangutan habitats or establish a local school program to increase conservation awareness among the local communities.\n\nWhile many of the nominees have lofty scientific degrees, others, like Sheila Bolin, Orlando, learned on the job of protecting animals at risk. A former law enforcement officer, Bolin first became familiar with swans while working as a tennis pro at a Florida resort.\n\nNow she and her colleagues at the Regal Swan Foundation are known worldwide as experts on the care of these birds for those who keep them in captivity, a 30-year commitment.\n\nBefore she was nominated she had never heard of the award. Now, she said, she's honored to be among those considered.\n\nBesides, there aren't many rewards in the type of work she and the other nominees do.\n\n\"If you do any type of wildlife and conservation, good luck,\" she said. \"There's not a lot of money in it. I just think about one step at a time.

Mamba. Average temperatures could rise by that much and more by the end of the century, the research found. The modeling used projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe work focused on five large national parks with diverse landscapes across the southern half of the continent. Researchers looked at temperature variations that could occur by 2055 and 2085 under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios.\n\nUnder a moderate scenario, temperatures could be 2.2 degrees Celsius warmer by 2055 and 2.5 C warmer by 2085, they concluded. But if greenhouse gas emissions aren't reined in, they found, each park could warm by as much as 4.6 C by 2085.\n\nTwo parks – Etosha National Park in Namibia and Hlane National Park in Eswatini – would become too warm for black rhinos and southern white rhinos in either scenario. Only one park, Tsavo West National Park in Kenya, would see more rainfall in the future, the researchers said.\n\nThe higher temperatures could quickly exceed an acceptable threshold for the rhinos, the study concluded. Temperatures would be increasingly unsuitable for both species, the researchers said, but white rhinos probably would be affected earlier.\n\nThe probability of either species surviving the heat could shrink to zero by 2085 in locations where the temperatures reach one of the higher scenarios, the researchers found.\n\nBut Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University who is not affiliated with the study, expressed optimism the rhinos will survive somewhere for the foreseeable future, given the wide range of conditions in which they can thrive.\n\n\"We must be concerned about the impacts of climate disruption,\" especially for vulnerable species, Pimm said. But it's difficult to predict how species will respond to climate disruption, and rhinos now live over a wide range of conditions, he said, including some very hot deserts.\n\nWhat do we know about rhinos in Africa?\n\nConservation scientists report they've seen rhino numbers begin to increase in Africa, although poaching is still a threat.\n\nSouthern white rhinos:\n\nAn estimated 16,800 southern white rhinos remain in the continent, primarily concentrated in five countries, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nThey weigh 4,000 to 6,000 pounds.\n\nThey stand 5 to 6 feet tall.\n\nBlack rhinos:\n\nCritically endangered.\n\nPopulation in Africa estimated at just under 6,500 by the international conservation union.\n\nThey weigh 1,750 to 3,000 pounds\n\nThey stand 4½ to 5½ feet tall.\n\nAs with other iconic large mammals in Africa, conservation union research has shown rhinos are important because they provide habitat for other wildlife species, contribute to the livelihoods and well-being of local people, and attract tourists from all over the world, which contributes to local economic development.\n\nWhat can be done to prepare for hotter temperatures?\n\nMost animals will be harmed by climate change, Mamba said. But it will be important for conservationists to watch for trends and plan for the future to help minimize the loss of biodiversity among vulnerable species.\n\nNational park managers in the region could begin planning now to help manage the future for rhinos and other animals if they are to be preserved, the researchers said.\n\n“This paper highlights the importance of using climate predictions for both park and rhino management,” Randhir said. “We propose that park managers think now about increasing water supplies, tree cover, watching for stress and planning to allow rhino migration as the world warms.”\n\nParks in other countries have explored taking steps to protect rhinos from climate change. In Nepal, a national park built an artificial soil mound for rhinos and other wildlife to seek refuge during extreme rainfall events, according to a study published in the journal Biological Conservation in October.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/18/indianapolis-zoo-names-inaugural-emerging-conservationist-award-winner/70102943007/", "title": "Indianapolis Zoo names inaugural Emerging Conservationist Award ...", "text": "Fanny Cornejo, the leader of an organization working to develop healthy ecosystems for the rare yellow-tailed wooly monkey and other wildlife in Peru, is the winner of the inaugural Inaugural Emerging Conservationist Award, Indianapolis Prize officials announced Tuesday.\n\nThe new award recognizes and supports the work of an early career conservationist.\n\nCornejo, a Peruvian primatologist and anthropologist, was honored for the research and conservation work done by her organization Yunkawasi.\n\n“It has been overwhelming, humbling and exciting to be selected,” Cornejo said. “There are a lot of different feelings for me; this is not only an award for me, it’s for my team.”\n\nThe award, supported by the Kobe Foundation, will include $50,000 for Cornejo to continue her efforts working as executive director at Yunkawasi to help endangered species and engage more than rural and indigenous communities to protect and sustainably manage habitat.\n\n“Fanny is leading the next generation of conservationists to protect nature and inspire people to care for our world,” Rob Shumaker, president and CEO of the Indianapolis Zoological Society said in a statement. “The depth of accomplishments set her apart from the other nominees. I can’t wait to see the impact of her career in conservation.”\n\n2023 Indianapolis Prize: Indianapolis Zoo announces nominees for worldwide wildlife conservation prize\n\nWho is Fanny Cornejo?\n\nCornejo dreamed of working with chimps as a child in Peru while watching Jane Goodall documentaries. When she began as a biology major at Stony Brook University, her focus was initially on the Human Genome Project, but that quickly shifted when she discovered just how diverse Peru’s ecosystems were.\n\n“There were still so many new species to describe, new species of monkeys out there,” Cornejo said, recalling her decision to refocus her major. “Peru is a dream place, it’s amazing but a little sad there is still so much to do. So, I shifted focus onto the wildlife of Peru and the Amazon and Andes.”\n\nProfessor Patricia Wright, who won the Indianapolis Prize in in 2014, mentors Cornejo at Stony Brook and in a statement called her an excellent scholar.\n\n“She is a dynamic leader, a person who works with governments as well as local farmers,” Wright said. “She inspired the (Peruvian) government to mint a coin in honor of the critically endangered species she studies.”\n\nCornejo’s shift of focus enabled her to make a trip to visit river communities in the Amazon where she began to realize the important dynamics of balancing a biodiversity with how people can subsist entirely on their environment.\n\nFinalists for 2023: Indianapolis Zoo announces six finalists for worldwide wildlife conservation prize\n\nShe quickly realized the largest animal endemic to Peru was the yellow-tail wooly monkey, which was nearly forgotten before being rediscovered in the 1980s.\n\n“It’s the largest animal and probably critically endangered,” Cornejo said. “It lives in the most disturbed ecosystem in Peru: the tropical Andes.”\n\nSlash-and-burn agriculture techniques and poorly planned infrastructure have created a slowly vanishing habitat. Providing support to communities and attention to this at-risk habitat is now a major focus of Yunkawasi.\n\nWhat are Cornejo’s achievements?\n\nCornejo and first project with Yunkawasi was assisting a community in the tropical Andes by providing support for sustainable management and conservation initiatives.\n\n“For a local community to set aside 20% of its territory for conservation, that means that development activities need to be reduced, economic activities need to be reduced. It means economies need to be transformed as well and options need to be presented to them,” she said. “We look at how to transform economies.”\n\nThese transformations to provide healthy ecosystems for primates and other wildlife are intuitively understood by communities and local governments, Cornejo said, but finding seed money for these projects can be challenging.\n\nIt can be easy to talk about how they can help communities, but what is most satisfying to Cornejo is Yunkawasi’s ability to give communities the tools and leadership to continue conservation initiatives as her organization hands over the reins.\n\n“Success is when we can step away and the conservation initiative can keep going,” Cornejo said. “They are the stakeholders, and it can be 30 or 50 families that are extremely committed to the initiative.”\n\nEmerging Conservationist nominees: Indianapolis Zoo announces finalists for new Emerging Conservationist Award\n\nAs Cornejo completes her doctorate, her ambitions grow. She is working on a nationwide campaign to make sure every Peruvian knows about the yellow-tail wooly monkey.\n\n“I want them to know there is a species that may go extinct in our lifetime,” Cornejo said. “I want every Peruvian, by the next three months, to be sick of hearing about it because it is everywhere.”\n\nWinning the inaugural Emerging Conservationist prize through the Indianapolis Prize will help Cornejo and Yunkawasi to scale up and show the world they can make it happen, she said.\n\n“This is fantastic that all of these efforts and sacrifices are recognized, and hopefully it will help us go to next level.,” she said.\n\nCornejo will be formally recognized at the Indianapolis Prize Gala downtown on Sept. 30.\n\nWhat is the Indianapolis Prize?\n\nWhile this is the first Emerging Conservationist award, the Indianapolis Prize has been recognizing conservationists across the globe who have achieved victories in advancing the sustainability of an animal species or group of species since 2006.\n\nThe Indianapolis Zoological Society in October announced 51 nominees for the 2023 Indianapolis Prize and narrowed it to six finalists in March. One winner will receive $250,000 and five finalists will win $50,000.\n\n“The 2023 Prize nominees represent the most accomplished wildlife conservationists dedicated to protecting and preserving animal species,” Rob Shumaker, president and CEO of the Indianapolis Zoo, said in a statement.\n\nA prize nominating committee and separate jury undertake a two-step judging process to select the finalists and winner. The top six conservationists will be celebrated at the Indianapolis Prize Gala on Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nKarl Schneider is an IndyStar environment reporter.

Jefferson and Kim Chandler\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAs bystanders trained their smartphone cameras on the riverfront dock while several white boaters pummeled a Black riverboat co-captain, they couldn’t have known the footage would elicit a national conversation about racial solidarity.\n\nYet, a week after multiple videos showing the now-infamous brawl and valiant defense of the outnumbered co-captain were shared widely on social media, it’s clear the event truly tapped into the psyche of Black America and created a broader cultural moment.\n\nAndrea Boyles, a sociology professor at Tulane University, said a long history of anti-Black racism and attacks and current events likely magnified the attack’s impact and response.\n\n“Especially at a time like now where we see an increase in anti-Black racism through legislation and otherwise, whether we’re thinking about history, the banning of Black history and curriculum and all sorts of things across the state of Florida” and elsewhere, Boyles said. “So this is why it is on the forefront of people’s minds. And folks are very much tuned in, Black people in particular.”\n\nMany see the Aug. 5 ordeal on the riverfront dock in Montgomery, Alabama’s capital city steeped in civil rights history, as a long-awaited answer to countless calls for help that went unanswered for past Black victims of violence and mob attacks.\n\n“We witnessed a white mob doing this to him,” said Michelle Browder, an artist and social justice entrepreneur in Montgomery, describing the attack by boaters on the Black riverboat co-captain.\n\n“I call it a mob because that is what it was, it was a mob mentality,” she added. “It then became a moment because you saw Black people coming together.”\n\nAfter being inundated with images and stories of lethal violence against Black people, including motorists in traffic stops, church parishioners and grocery shoppers, the video from Montgomery struck a chord because it didn’t end in the worst of outcomes for Black Americans.\n\n“For Montgomery to have this moment, we needed to see a win. We needed to see our community coming together and we needed to see justice,” Browder said.\n\nVideos of the brawl showed the participants largely divided along racial lines. Several white men punched or shoved the Black riverboat co-captain after he took a separate vessel to shore and tried to move their pontoon boat. The white boaters’ private vessel was docked in a spot designated for the city-owned Harriott II riverboat, on which more than 200 passengers were waiting to disembark.\n\nThe videos then showed mostly Black people rushing to the co-captain’s defense, including a Black teenage riverboat crew member who swam to the dock. The videos also showed the ensuing brawl that included a Black man hitting a white person with a folding chair.\n\nAs of Friday, Alabama police had charged four white people with misdemeanor assault. The folding chair-wielding man turned himself in Friday and was charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nJim Kittrell, the captain of Harriott II, told The Daily Beast that he thought race might have been a factor in the initial attack on his co-captain, but the resulting melee was not a “Black and white thing.”\n\n“This was our crew upset about these idiots,” Kittrell also told WACV radio station.\n\nHe later explained that several members of his crew, seen confronting the pontoon boat party after the riverboat docked, “felt they had to retaliate, which was unfortunate.”\n\n“I wish we could have stopped it from happening but, when you see something like that, it was difficult. It was difficult for me to sit there in the wheelhouse watching him being attacked,” Kittrell told the station.\n\nKittrell told The Associated Press by phone that the city had asked him not to talk about the brawl.\n\nMajor Saba Coleman of the Montgomery Police Department said on Tuesday that hate crime charges were ruled out after the department consulted with the local FBI. But several observers noted the presence of a hate motivation, or lack thereof, on the part of the pontoon boat party was not why the event resonated so strongly.\n\n“All these individuals having smartphones and cameras have democratized media and information. In the past, it was a very narrow scope on what news was being reported and from what perspectives,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said.\n\nThe technology, Johnson added, “opened up an opportunity for America as a whole to understand the impact of racism, the impact of violence and the opportunity to create a narrative that’s more consistent with keeping African Americans and other communities safe.”\n\nThe riverfront brawl spawned a multitude of memes, jokes, parodies, reenactments and even T-shirts. “Lift every chair and swing,” read one shirt in a play on “ Lift Ev’ry Voice And Sing,” the late-19th century hymn sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem.\n\nAnother meme likened the co-captain’s toss of his hat into the air to sending the “bat signal,” a reference to the D.C. Comics character Batman. One image of the scene captured from bystander video was altered to imitate Marvel Comics’ Avengers characters assembling through magic portals on the dock to defend the Black co-captain.\n\nMany observers on social media were quick to point out the significance of the city and location where the brawl took place. Montgomery was the first capital of the Confederacy and the riverfront is an area where enslaved people were once unloaded to be sold at auction. The area is a few blocks from the spot where Rosa Parks was arrested for disobeying bus segregation laws.\n\n“Much of (the riverfront brawl reaction) is emblematic of the history of Montgomery,” said Timothy Welbeck, the director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\n“This is the home of the bus boycott; this is the home of intense, racialized segregation and various forms of resistance today,” he said. “Even if there wasn’t an explicit mention of race, many people saw a white man assaulting a Black man as a proxy for some of the racist behavior that they’ve seen before. It brought about a sense of solidarity and unified fate, too, in this particular moment.”\n\nThen there’s the lingering trauma of seeing past Black victims of violence and mob attacks suffer without help or intervention. Here was the rare event in which bystanders not only chronicled the moment but were able to intervene and help someone they saw being victimized.\n\nIn other notable instances, such as George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, bystanders were restrained because the perpetrators were law enforcement officers. In a video of Floyd’s encounter with police filmed by Black bystander Darnella Frazier, people can be heard pleading for the Black man’s life as he gasped for air with a white officer’s knee held to his neck.\n\nPhysically intervening in Minneapolis would have invited arrests and placed the would-be rescuers at risk for harm themselves.\n\nHistorically, lynching victims were often taken from their families as the Black community had to stand by mutely. Emmett Till’s family members in Mississippi were haunted by their inability to stop the white men who kidnapped and killed him.\n\nBowder, the Montgomery artist, said the conversation needs to continue.\n\n“I’m hoping for a hopeful message out of this,” she said.\n\nKatrina Hazzard, a Rutgers University professor in the Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice, said she has seen that hopeful message in the comments of support that have crossed racial and ethnic lines in identifying the aggressors and the right for people to defend themselves and the crewman.\n\n“That’s just been refreshing for me to see and for me to hear across the board,” she said.\n\nAisha I.

They’re asking the judge to re-protect the bears – including what is arguably the world's most famous grizzly – under the Endangered Species Act, the way a judge previously did in 2007.\n\nHunters say they should be allowed to kill a small number of grizzlies because the population has grown large enough to prompt President Donald Trump’s administration to remove their special protections last year.\n\nThis would be the first grizzly bear hunt in the lower 48 states since the 1970s, when the bears’ numbers fell so low scientists worried they could become extinct. The push for grizzly hunting is politically popular in conservative Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, where hunters are eager to test their mettle against this majestic symbol of the West.\n\n“It’s not being bloodthirsty. The fact of the matter is that we need to do something for the benefit of the bear,\" said hunting guide Sy Gilliland, a Wyoming hunting industry spokesman. “We can’t turn the clock back and remove the people from Wyoming. The bear is overflowing. He just needs to have his number trimmed back for the benefit of the species overall.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Christensen on Aug. 30 is set to hear arguments in six lawsuits brought by groups that include the Humane Society of the United States, Earthjustice and several Native American Tribes. Environmental groups have also resorted to what hunters consider dirty tricks to stymie the proposed kill, including trying to acquire some of the licenses granted to would-be bear hunters. Although about 7,000 people requested a permit, only a small number of hunters will be permitted to stalk grizzlies at any one time, to prevent accidentally killing more than planned.\n\nThe grizzly hunt is set to begin in two phases, one on Sept. 1 and the other on Sept. 15, and state wildlife officials say they can cancel it if the judge orders them to.\n\n\"No one is killing a grizzly bear to eat it,\" said Melissa Thomasma, the executive director of Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, which opposes the hunt. \"This is about ego.”\n\nWhile most of Wyoming is highly conservative and supports the grizzly hunt, opposition is centered around the generally liberal and wealthy Jackson, adjacent to Grand Teton National Park, which draws millions of visitors annually hoping to catch a glimpse of the bears living in and around the park. Hunters would be banned from stalking the bears in either Teton or adjacent Yellowstone national parks, but those bears are fair game if they leave the protection of park boundaries. In all, the area in which the bears live covers about 28,000 square miles, which is about the size of South Carolina. An adult male grizzly can roam over an area the size of New York City.\n\nHunters say the bear population poses a threat to humans living in the area, and that a state-sanctioned kill by sportsmen is the best way to control the population and recognize the money and time hunters have invested in helping the species recover. In the United States, wildlife is managed on behalf of the people, and part of that includes the right to hunt certain animals if scientists say there's enough of them. Because hunters believe they’re entitled to harvest the bears themselves, they oppose having government sharpshooters reduce the population. Hunters who kill a grizzly will be allowed to keep their bodies to mount or turn into a rug.\n\nJust how many bears live in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem remains up for debate. That's in large part because grizzlies range over large, sometimes overlapping, areas, crossing state lines and park boundaries with little concern for the wildlife biologists charged with monitoring them. Officially, an estimated 700 bears live in the area, up from 136 in 1975, when they were protected as an endangered species. Hunting advocates say there are more like 1,000 bears, while critics like Thomasma worry recent increases in natural bear deaths have put the species on a downward trend.\n\nFederal officials in 2007 tried to remove the protections, but a judge ordered the bear to stay on the list over fears that climate change was reducing the food supply. A new federal survey said the food supply is adequate. A federal-state committee of government wildlife experts and managers is responsible for tracking the bears' population.\n\nThe numbers of bears matters because Endangered Species Act protection can only be withdrawn if the population of bears is deemed \"self sustaining,\" meaning there's enough baby bears born each year to offset any deaths. And bears die from both natural causes and by human intervention, largely when outdoorsmen kill them to protect themselves or when state wildlife officials euthanize bears that have become accustomed to humans and their tasty, easy-to-get garbage.\n\nWhen Lewis and Clark explored the West in the early 1800s, federal officials say, an estimated 50,000-100,000 grizzly bears roamed between the Pacific Ocean and the Great Plains. Today there’s only about 1,700 grizzlies in all of the Lower 48 states, federal officials say, primarily in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Idaho officials are planning to permit hunters to kill one bear this year. Alaska's population of grizzlies is considered a distinct group.\n\nWhile the grizzly population in the \"Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\" is much smaller than it once was, the bears pose an undeniable threat to people who choose to live near them. Hunters tell stories of grizzlies killing young elk or calves just for sport, and of the risk that many grizzlies pose to people using public lands. While black bears are far more common, they're generally docile and usually run away from humans. Grizzlies are much larger and potentially more violent, weighing in at up to 700 pounds for an adult male. Their Latin name reflects the terror they once evoked: \"Ursus arctos horribilis.\"\n\n\"Regulated hunting is not only a pragmatic and cost-effective tool for managing populations at desired levels; it also generates public support, ownership of the resource and funding for conservation as well as greater tolerance for some species such as large predators that may cause safety concerns and come in conflict with certain human uses,\" Wyoming wildlife officials said in publishing their hunting plan.\n\nWildlife officials in Wyoming last year killed at least 14 grizzly bears that attacked livestock or threatened humans. Hunters killed another nine bears that were threatening them, and at least one bear was killed by a car. Many of Wyoming's grizzly bears live around Grand Teton National Park outside Jackson, and photographing them from the roadside is a popular tourist activity.\n\n“It’s like being Monday-morning quarterbacked by people who don’t really have a clue what’s happening on the ground,” said Gilliland. “The science backs this up. This bear population has recovered. It’s de-listed. The bear is heavily studied. It’s heavily monitored.”\n\nJackson doesn't yet have a problem with grizzlies entering town – at least not live ones. But walk down the streets and the bears are everywhere, from the goofy T-shirts to the wooden carvings and bronze sculptures. Many depictions show what appear to be friendly grizzlies, which offend hunters who consider them monsters prone to killing calves for sport. Other hunters say the bears steal their elk or moose kills before they can finish packing the meat out.\n\n\"You can't understand it until you've been eyeball to eyeball with one,\" Gilliland said.\n\nBut that's precisely what brings millions of tourists to Jackson, Yellowstone and Grand Teton: the chance to see a wild grizzly.\n\nOne of the grizzly fans suing to stop the hunt, Illinois-based tax attorney Robert H. Aland, says he's visited the area dozens of times over the past 30 years and has even helped buy private property to expand the bears' protected habitat inside the national parks. Aland, who opposes the hunt, argues that killing the grizzlies will diminish his pleasure in visiting the area.\n\nThe hunting plan \"simply stated, is a death warrant,\" Aland said in his suit.\n\nHunting opponents fear that fate faces Grizzly 399. Documented by wildlife photographers and news crews for decades, 399 is the bear everyone wants to spot and many want to protect. On a recent August week, Grand Teton park rangers closed off a popular wildlife viewing road because 399 and her two cubs were eating berries in the area.\n\nThe bear, born in 1996, has raised at least 14 cubs over the years and is a common sight in the area. Her life has been particularly well-documented due to the efforts of wildlife photographer Tom Mangelsen, who lives in Jackson and published a book in which the bear starred. The bear has been highlighted by National Geographic and 60 Minutes, and longtime Jackson-area residents consider her a member of the community.\n\nMangelsen has secured a grizzly-hunting permit for the season, although he doesn't plan to actually kill a bear. Instead, he and other environmental activists are trying to protect the bears by taking up licenses that would otherwise go to real hunters.\n\nMangelsen has also turned his Jackson gallery into the de-facto headquarters for hunt opponents, distributing anti-hunt literature to tourists. Other activists have erected billboards in Wyoming and Colorado showing friendly-looking grizzlies with the tagline “I’m not a trophy.”\n\nMangelsen, who declined to comment, has also recruited conservationist Jane Goodall to oppose the hunt. Goodall, who is traveling abroad and could not immediately be reached, has long argued that the Endangered Species Act needs strengthening.\n\nThomasma, of Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, says there's a far more practical reason for protecting the bears: tourism. Out-of-state visitors spend more than $1 billion in Teton County annually, and bad publicity about the hunt risks killing that proverbial golden goose. Only three bears would be killed in Teton County, which is home to Jackson and Grand Teton National Park; the other licenses are set aside for more rural areas surrounding Teton County.\n\n“People – including hunters – know where the park boundaries are. The bears don’t,\" Thomasma said. \"We are just begging for a repeat of Cecil the lion. If 399 sets one foot over the boundary, she’s destined to become a bearskin rug.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}]}

Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future, but you just feel nice and loose, ok?\"\n\nAt one point during his 72-minute address, Trump referenced a racial slur while discussing nuclear weapons. “I call it the N-word,\" he told his audience of mostly stone-faced officers. \"There are two N-words and you can’t use either of them.”\n\nWith Trump as his backstop, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth unleashed a new array of directives, telling the country's military elite that they had gone soft and his new reforms would weed out political correctness from the world's most powerful armed forces.\n\nThe addresses by Trump and Hegseth, after top military brass were summoned from commands around the world, came as Trump has ordered U.S. troops into a growing number of cities to support deportations and suppress crime.\n\nHegseth, a former Fox News host, railed against \"decay\" at the Defense Department, telling the assembled commanders he would crack down on physical fitness and grooming standards, and throw out \"woke\" policies. He spoke of “fat generals and admirals.”\n\nTrump vowed to fire military leaders ''right on the spot\" as he left for the high-stakes summit on Sept. 30.\n\nEchoing Trump's threats, Hegseth said if any senior officers did not resonate with his message, they should resign.\n\n\"If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, you should do the honorable thing and resign.\"\n\nNew standards seek a fitter, clean-shaven military\n\nAccording to Pentagon policy memos, fitness tests will increase in frequency and intensity for active duty troops, who must now pass twice-yearly tests. Military members will also have their body fat measured twice per year.\n\nTroops with combat-focused jobs, such as infantrymen or tank crew members, must meet male-based test standards in their annual general fitness test, and they must also complete a \"combat field test\" once yearly.\n\nHegseth, who has long argued that women benefited from lowered fitness standards when they entered combat arms jobs during former President Barack Obama's administration, said the move \"is not about preventing women from serving.\"\n\n-- Davis Winkie\n\nTop Dem pans Trump and Hegseth 'culture war' speeches\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, D-New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, blasted Trump and Hegseth for what he called empty posturing that failed to address the country's national security challenges.\n\n“President Trump offered no national security vision, just rambling grievances and partisan attacks,\" Meeks said in a statement. \"Even worse, his call to use U.S. cities as ‘training grounds’ for the military is chilling. This is what dictators do.\"\n\n\"For his part, Secretary Hegseth’s rants about ‘dudes in dresses’ and other culture-war bogeymen only underscored his unfitness to lead,\" Meeks said. He called for Hegseth to resign over his \"overall lack of professionalism and experience.\"\n\nTrump tells generals of 'the enemy within'\n\nTrump told the assembled generals and admirals of his plans to take on \"the enemy within\" using military power.\n\n\"Last month, I signed an executive order to provide training for a quick reaction force that can help quell civil disturbances,\" he said. \"So this is going to be a big thing for the people in this room, because it's the enemy from within, and we have to handle it before it gets out of control.\"\n\nUsing street crime and anti-deportation protests as his justification, Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis and Portland. He also ordered active-duty Marines to Los Angeles.\n\nTrump speech 'filled with mistruths,' retired general says\n\nRetired Lt. Gen Mark Hertling said Trump's speech was \"somewhat shocking\" and \"filled with mistruths.\"\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC, Hertling, the former commander of Army forces in Europe, said, \"I found my mouth open. I just couldn't believe some of the things that were being said to this group of individuals who have such experience.\"\n\n\"I find it really offensive that anyone is insulting them, and claiming that their promotions and their advancement through the services are the result of policies or 'wokeness' or DEI,\" Hertling said. \"It's just not true.\"\n\n‘Two N-words.’ Trump references racial slur in discussing nuclear threat\n\nTrump told U.S. military leaders at Quantico on Sept. 30 that he refers to the nuclear threat as the “N-word,” referencing a racial slur.\n\nThe president noted he sent nuclear submarines “over to the coast of Russia” in response to provocative comments by a Russian spokesperson referencing a nuclear control system.\n\n“We can’t let people throw around that word,” Trump said. “I call it the N-word. There are two N-words and you can’t use either of them.”\n\nHegseth's long war on 'woke'\n\nHegseth's remarks dovetailed with his long-held views − the subject of his 2024 book, The War on Warriors − that diversity initiatives, political correctness and a perceived lowering of standards on behalf of women made the military weaker.\n\nAt the Quantico meeting, Hegseth said those convictions led him to fire a number of top officers, an apparent allusion to the abrupt retirements of Joint Chiefs chairman Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the top lawyers of the Army and Air Force, and Army Gen. Timothy Haugh of U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, among others.\n\n\"It's nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create, or even benefitted from, that culture,\" Hegseth said, explaining he has attempted to spare officers who were merely complying with the previous administration's orders and to fire those who \"are truly invested in the 'Woke Department.'\"\n\nTrump says 'dangerous cities' should be 'military training grounds'\n\nDays after he dispatched the National Guard to Portland, Trump said “dangerous cities” should be used as military “training grounds.”\n\n“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” Trump said.\n\nTrump has already deployed the National Guard to the southern border, to Los Angeles to quell protests against mass deportations, and to the streets of Washington, DC, where many are now tasked with \"beatification\" projects like picking up trash and raking leaves.\n\n\"Washington, DC, went from our most unsafe city to just about our safest city in a period of a month,\" he told the Quantico audience.\n\nThese statements struck Mark Cancian, a senior defense advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, as worrisome.\n\n\"If he puts out some directive specifying that the military should use lethal force, then that could be a huge problem,\" Cancian said. \"The military is just not trained in the nuances about civilian rights and the use of lethal force,\" he added.\n\nStone-faced generals, admirals quieter than Trump's usual crowds\n\nThe audience was made up of men and women of various ages in military uniforms with neat haircuts. Pool reports indicate the crowd was much more still and quiet than what Trump is accustomed to at political events or campaign rallies.\n\nSeveral officers were sitting in a row, looking expressionless and inscrutable, with few smiles.\n\nThe president's attacks on former President Joe Biden were met with silence, the pool report said. Some of Trump's lines elicited polite ripples of laughter. One man in a Navy uniform was taking notes in a book. Another was rolling his head and looking restless as the president railed against the media.\n\nTrump says 'Defense Department' name was 'first sign of wokeness'\n\nTrump praised the generals as “incredible people” straight out of “central casting.”\n\nHe said it was his idea to make the Defense Department’s name the War Department, a name it carried before it was changed in the years after World War II.\n\n“That was probably the first sign of wokeness,” he said of the name change.\n\nWho attended the meeting\n\nHundreds of the U.S. military's seniormost officers and enlisted troops attended the event, including top generals from around the world.\n\nThe Pentagon did not provide an attendee list.\n\nA camera pan during Hegseth's remarks appeared to capture two of the military's most far-flung brass in the auditorium: Army Gen. Xavier Brunson, who leads American and United Nations forces in South Korea, and Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, who heads U.S. Indo-Pacific Command from his Hawaii headquarters.\n\nMany other top generals also appeared on the official video feed, including U.S. Northern Command leader Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot, who oversees the military's work along the Mexico border and its immigration enforcement support; Army Gen. Bryan Fenton, who heads U.S. Special Operations Command; and Air Force Gen. Anthony Cotton, who oversees the nation's nuclear arsenal atop U.S. Strategic Command.\n\nMore fitness, no beards\n\nHegseth announced 10 new directives, including implementing physical fitness standards, bringing combat arms positions up to the \"highest male standard\" and ordering troops to shave their beards and cut their hair short.\n\nWhile generals and admirals at the meeting wouldn't be forced to take their own physical fitness test, every member of the joint force would be required to take a physical fitness test twice a year and meet height and weight standards.\n\n\"‘We’re not talking hot yoga and stretching,\" Hegseth added.\n\nCostly gathering of top brass\n\nOn just a week's notice, Hegseth mandated all senior commanders at the rank of brigadier general or rear admiral lower half and above to report to the Virginia base around 40 miles south of Washington, DC. President Donald Trump revealed days before the meeting that he would also address the generals.\n\nDefense experts said the volume of top generals and their entourages descending on the base and the small town it surrounds was likely to create traffic snarls and a security nightmare. Beginning the day before the meeting, \"residents can expect increased security checks, altered traffic patterns and increased security personnel,\" read a public notice on the town of Quantico's Facebook page.\n\nThe cost of the meeting – bringing the senior officers and their staff to Quantico, lodging them, and securing the area – could add up to millions of dollars, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n\"A thing like this has never been done before because they came from all over the world and there’s a little bit of expense, not much, but there’s a little expense for that,\" Trump said of the unprecedented meeting.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and other critics blasted the meeting as a waste of money and said taking the nation's top generals off their jobs for a pep rally-type event was a bad idea.\n\nThe meeting \"raises profound concerns about security, cost and operational impacts,\" among them that \"our adversaries will know that many of our most senior commanders from around the world are tied up together with some portion of the highest level of the civilian chain of command,\" Democratic Senators Tammy Duckworth and Mazie Hirono, who both sit on the Armed Services Committee, wrote in a letter to Hegseth.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/25/hegseth-meeting-top-military-officers/86346182007/", "title": "Hegseth orders last-minute meeting of top military brass next week", "text": "WASHINGTON − Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered about 800 senior military leaders stationed around the world to come to a last-minute meeting in northern Virginia on Sept. 30.\n\nA meeting with such senior leadership would normally be planned months in advance.\n\n\"The secretary of war will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,\" Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. The Pentagon declined to disclose the reason for the meeting, which will occur at Quantico, a Marine Corps base around 30 miles south of the Pentagon.\n\nAll senior officers at the rank of brigadier general and above must attend the meeting, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the meeting. Around 800 officers currently fall into that category, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nSenior military officials in some cases command thousands of troops. Most have detailed schedules weeks in advance, which have now been upended.\n\nIt was unclear how many officials would actually attend the event, but it is rare to have so many senior officials in the same room at the same time.\n\nThe U.S. has troops around the world, including in distant locations like South Korea, Japan and across the Middle East – which are commanded by two, three and four-star generals and admirals.\n\nHegseth, a former Fox News host, has moved with stunning speed to reshape the department, firing top generals and admirals as he seeks to implement Trump's national security agenda and root out diversity initiatives he calls discriminatory.\n\nIn February, he fired Air Force General C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership.\n\nLast month, Hegseth fired the head of the Pentagon's intelligence agency and two other senior military commanders.\n\nIn May, Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in the number of four-star officers. In that May memo, Hegseth said there would also be a minimum 20% reduction in the number of general officers in the National Guard and an additional 10% reduction among general and flag officers across the military.\n\n\"More generals and admirals does not lead to more success,\" Hegseth said at the time.\n\nNow, many of those generals and admirals will be in the same room.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/29/hegseth-trump-quantico-meeting-cost/86422869007/", "title": "Inside Hegseth's Quantico mystery meeting, which could cost millions", "text": "WASHINGTON – They're coming to take a loyalty oath. To hear a speech about \"warrior ethos.\" To take a physical fitness test.\n\nThese are among the array of theories outsiders have floated in their attempts to explain a mysterious mass gathering Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hastily ordered last week, summoning hundreds of top military commanders to Quantico, Virginia, on Sept. 30.\n\nThe Pentagon isn't dropping hints about why it ordered its highest-level officers from around the world to report to the base for an 8 a.m. meeting, which will likely cost taxpayers millions of dollars and create security challenges at home and abroad.\n\nPreparations for the gathering have ratcheted up since President Donald Trump revealed that he would make an appearance at what he called a \"very nice meeting.\"\n\n\"It’s really just a very nice meeting talking about how well we’re doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things,\" Trump told NBC on Sept. 28. \"It’s just a good message.\"\n\nCommanders had about a week's notice they were expected at Quantico, according to news reports and a defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Normally, a meeting of this importance would be scheduled months in advance.\n\nThe Washington Post and New York Times reported Hegseth would deliver a speech about the \"warrior ethos\" and fitness standards.\n\nSome, including retired military leaders, aired concerns about the gathering publicly.\n\nBen Hodges, the former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, posted to X, referencing when Adolf Hitler summoned German generals in 1935 to swear a \"personal loyalty oath to the Führer.\" Hegseth wrote in reply, \"Cool story, General.\"\n\nCould this have been an email?\n\nOne thing is for certain, several experts told USA TODAY: this could have been an email – or at the very least, a conference call.\n\n\"They could host a video teleconference and not have to cost taxpayers millions of dollars,\" said Virginia Burger, senior defense policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nCongress encourages military units to go through the annual travel-dedicated funds it appropriates to them by the end of the fiscal year – which falls squarely on the day of the meeting, Sept. 30. The pots of money commanders will draw from to book their Quantico trips are likely running low, according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute specializing in defense and the Pentagon budget.\n\n\"They can probably move things around and maybe delay a little bit of training or some purchases into the next fiscal year. But it’s going to be a real headache,\" Harrison said.\n\nSome units \"may be looking through all the couch cushions to find the change to pay for that,\" said Burger.\n\nShutdown could trap generals at Quantico\n\nAdding further confusion is the increasingly likely government shutdown. If commanders' aides haven't booked return flights, they could get stuck. That would likely require Trump to \"wave a magic wand\" and authorize the funds to bring them home, Harrison said.\n\nSome top generals, such as commanders of the 11 combatant commands, many of which are broadly dispersed geographically, are required to travel on official Defense Department VIP planes. But the majority who must fly will likely end up traveling by commercial flight, in economy seats, Burger and Harrison said.\n\nMilitary leaders from far flung regions will stay in hotels around the area. Quantico has one dedicated on-base hotel, but it will likely fill up, as commanders with large entourages in tow take up multiple rooms, according to Burger, who worked as a warfighting instructor on the base for four years.\n\n\"That’s not going to be cheap,\" she said.\n\n\"Assistance and security personnel have to get rooms near the commander. It might end up being five or 10 rooms for a senior commander,\" said Harrison.\n\nOn top of that, the leaders will require stipends for daily meals and incidentals. All told, it could add up to \"millions of dollars,\" said Burger.\n\nCritics have said that removing the nation's top military officials from the playing field was an inherently risky move.\n\n\"Gaps in command worldwide are potentially dangerous,\" Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote of the meeting. \"Although there will be acting commanders still in place, the large number of absentees might open a vulnerability.\"\n\nTrump's presence at the event means the Secret Service must be on the ground and take the lead in securing the area. Locking it down to the necessary degree could also create disruptions to the FBI Academy at Quantico.\n\nThe Secret Service said the process would be no different from any other presidential appearance – apart from the out-of-the-ordinary nature of this gathering.\n\nBut others disagreed. \"Security at Quantico will be a nightmare,\" Cancian wrote.\n\nQuantico's National Museum of the Marine Corps will be closed for the morning of Sept. 30, the base's libraries have shuttered and students at the base's elementary school will get the day off.\n\nBurger said there will likely be a traffic snarl for the ages on the interstate highway near Quantico, and around the small town, population 587, that surrounds the base.\n\n\"If I worked at Quantico, I would work from home that day,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/30/hegseth-pentagon-trump-generals-quantico-meeting/86436423007/", "title": "Hegseth rips Pentagon 'decay,' 'fat generals' at Quantico meeting", "text": "President Donald Trump threatened firings and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lambasted \"decades of decay\" at the Pentagon as they spoke before a silent audience of hundreds of top military commanders who'd traveled from around the world on short notice to hear them at a Quantico, Virginia military base.\n\nTrump spoke for over an hour, touching on his deployment of the National Guard to cities run by Democrats and his negotiations to end foreign conflicts. Hegseth, who took the podium first before a billboard-sized American flag, unveiled his major policy priorities, telling the country's military elite that new measures would weed out political correctness among the world's most powerful armed forces.\n\nAs some reports anticipated, Hegseth used the occasion to laud the \"warrior ethos\" and \"peace through strength,\" and Trump delivered a characteristic speech, rife with self-praise. Critics said the gathering was a waste of taxpayer dollars and dangerous to national security. But it gave Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor who'd attained a lower rank during his military service than any of his guests in attendance, an opportunity to call for top leadership to get on board with his new Pentagon priorities.\n\nHere's a look at key takeaways from the Quantico meeting.\n\nLeaders who aren't in sync with the program should 'resign'\n\nBoth Trump and Hegseth told the gathering that generals and admirals who had problems with the Trump administration's program should resign.\n\n\"If you don't like what I'm saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future. But you just feel nice and loose, okay?\" Trump said. He had told reporters, with characteristic bravado, before arriving at the gathering that he would fire the generals \"right on the spot\" if he didn't like them.\n\nHegseth also delivered ultimatums. He told the senior officers they should resign if his words made their \"heart sink.\"\n\n\"If the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,\" Hegseth said.\n\nMichael Smith, a retired Navy Rear Admiral and president of National Security Leaders of America, said it was \"ironic\" that Hegseth advocated for stamping out politics before telling them to resign if they were not in alignment with his goals.\n\n\"The Secretary starts out saying how important it is for this group of generals and admirals to be apolitical. Then he goes on to air cultural grievances, and then says, 'If you don’t agree with this political vision, you should resign,'\" Smith said.\n\nSmith said the tenor of both speeches broke with standards.\n\n\"Demanding personal loyalty to an administration's political policies goes against the apolitical nature of our military,\" he said.\n\nMilitary could use 'dangerous cities' as 'training grounds'\n\nTrump suggested in his remarks that \"dangerous cities\" in the U.S. could be used as \"training grounds\" for military troops.\n\n“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” he said.\n\nThe statement came days after he deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, a move opposed by the state's governor and other local officials. Trump has also deployed troops to Los Angeles, the southern border, and Washington, DC, where many soldiers were tasked with \"beautifying\" neighborhoods, including picking up trash and raking leaves.\n\n\"Washington, DC, went from our most unsafe city to just about our safest city in a period of a month,\" he said, lauding the National Guard troops in the nation's capital.\n\nThese statements struck Mark Cancian, a senior defense advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, as worrisome.\n\n\"If he puts out some directive specifying that the military should use lethal force, then that could be a huge problem,\" Cancian said. \"The military is just not trained in the nuances about civilian rights and the use of lethal force,\" he added.\n\nHegseth goes after 'decades of decay'\n\nHegseth told the crowd that \"decades of decay\" turned the armed forces into the \"woke department.\" Under past leadership, he said, military officials were promoted based on their race or gender, standards slipped and \"toxic ideological garbage\" had \"infected\" the department.\n\n\"We are clearing out the debris, removing the distraction, clearing the way for leaders,\" he said, echoing language Trump administration officials have used often during his second term. \"You might say we're ending the war on warriors.\"\n\nIt was a common theme for Hegseth, who wrote a book called \"The War on Warriors.\" Since he took the reins at the Pentagon in January, Hegseth has led a campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI policies, throughout the military, including firing top generals and dismissing military lawyers, ripping down internet content and kicking out transgender troops.\n\nCancian, who is also a retired colonel, said the most important part of the speeches was \"what was not there.\"\n\n\"There was no purge of the generals, no demand for a loyalty oath, no demand for adherence to partisan political policies,\" Cancian said.\n\nSome had feared Hegseth might do that when he ordered the Quantico meeting the week prior.\n\nHegseth delivered remarks to higher-ranking service members\n\nAs Hegseth addressed the crowd of hundreds of the military's most senior decorated members, he paced back and forth in front of a giant American flag reminiscent of the iconic scene of a World War II general from the classic military movie \"Patton.\"\n\nTrue to military form, the rows of top generals and admirals in his audience remained stoic and silent as he delivered the speech.\n\nTrump later remarked on the silence in the room, saying, \"I've never walked into a room so silent. Don't laugh, don't laugh. You're not allowed to do that.\"\n\nCancian said the generals and admirals \"had clearly been briefed about how to react,\" and not to cheer or clap for the speeches.\n\nBetween the speaker and the audience, the deficit in military leadership experience was striking. In his years of service, Hegseth reached the rank of major, far below the lowest-ranked leader in the room, and he has never commanded a military unit.\n\nIn his book, \"The War on Warriors,\" and public comments, Hegseth has outlined a vision in which a Pentagon outsider is needed to shatter a rotten military establishment.\n\nHegseth sets 'highest male standard' for combat roles\n\nHegseth said he had directed the military to return all combat arms positions to \"the highest male standard\" for physical fitness. Combat arms units would also require an added field test, he said.\n\nHe said standards that he claimed were changed in 2015 to allow for women to join combat arms units must be brought back.\n\n\"This is not about preventing women from serving,\" he said. \"But when it comes to any job that requires physical power, performing combat, those physical standards must be high and gender-neutral.\"\n\nMonths before Trump picked him to lead the military, Hegseth said publicly that women \"straight up\" shouldn't be in combat roles, provoking concerns among many in the military that he would ban women from those positions. In April, he ordered the military to restore \"sex-neutral\" fitness standards – experts previously told USA TODAY that women in combat are nearly all subject to the same standards as men, meaning the standards were not changed.\n\nTwice-a-year fitness tests, tighter grooming standards\n\nHegseth announced that every member of the military, from top to bottom, would need to undergo a physical fitness test and conform to height and weight standards twice a year.\n\n\"It's completely unacceptable to see fat admirals and generals in the halls of the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said.\n\nHe also said the Defense Department would crack down on grooming standards – \"no more beards, long hair, superficial individual expression,\" he said.\n\n\"At my direction, the era of unprofessional appearance is over.\"\n\nHegseth announces overhaul of whistleblower, equal opportunity policies\n\nHegseth announced an overhaul of equal opportunity policies in the military and at the inspector general's office, the Pentagon's internal watchdog, which investigates complaints from anonymous whistleblowers.\n\n\"No more frivolous complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more repeat complainants, no more smearing reputations,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon's inspector general was one of 17 agency leaders Trump fired in January. The position remains open.\n\nHegseth is also facing an investigation by the Pentagon's acting inspector general over his use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to share classified information about a U.S. military operation in Yemen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/09/30/quantico-hegseth-ice-military-shutdown-michigan-shooting-glp-1-nicole-kidman-keith-urban/86433333007/", "title": "Quantico meeting, ICE, Michigan shooting, GLP-1, Nicole Kidman ...", "text": "Good morning!🙋🏼‍♀️ I'm Nicole Fallert.

The scandal has prompted many American Catholics to leave the church, which counts about 70 million Americans as members.\n\nLast week, Francis defrocked former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, 88, after Vatican officials found him guilty of sex crimes against minors and adults. McCarrick is the most senior Catholic official to be defrocked for such crimes, and church experts say that's a reflection of how slowly the church has moved in response to the scandal.\n\nAfter a damning grand jury report released last summer uncovered 300 abusive priests in Pennsylvania, multiple state attorneys general have opened their own cases, and hundreds of new victims are expected to come forward across the U.S.\n\nThe Rev.

And a lot of its troops, quite frankly. And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.”\n\nBlinken told reporters that Russian attempts to “subjugate Ukraine and take its independence” has “failed.”\n\n“Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine, to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence – that has failed. It has sought to assert the power of its military and its economy. We, of course, are seeing just the opposite, a military that is dramatically underperforming and an economy … as a result of sanctions that is in shambles,” Blinken said.\n\n“We don’t know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene,” he said.\n\nThe remarks are the latest in a series of public comments by US leaders challenging Putin’s longevity as Russia’s President and as the war in Ukraine has shifted to a new phrase in the east. US President Joe Biden and the White House have said the US is not officially calling for regime change and officials have also predicted a potentially drawn-out conflict.\n\nAustin’s comments also seem to represent a further extension of US goals, building on past comments from Blinken and other officials about Moscow’s status at the end of the war.\n\nBlinken last week said in a statement that the US’ “continued efforts to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy together will help weaken the Russian Government’s position and further isolate them from the world until Russia ends its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”\n\nThe White House said Monday that Austin was talking about the US “objective to prevent” the Russian military from taking over Ukraine, and described it as consistent with the administration’s long-held goal.\n\nAsked about the defense secretary’s comments, a National Security Council spokesperson said the US wants Ukraine to win and “that’s why we’re doing everything we can to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to strengthen the Ukrainians’ hands on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.”\n\nA senior State Department official told the traveling press Monday that such negotiations are “evolving,” noting that “Russia’s hand has been weakened as a result of these first two months, Ukraine’s hand has been strengthened, that effects the positions that there would be in any negotiation,” but “part of the problem is as best we can tell there is no effective negotiation going on right now.”\n\nUS diplomats to return to Ukraine\n\nThe visit to Kyiv by Blinken and Austin makes them the highest-level US officials to have traveled to the country since the Russian invasion began in late February.\n\nWhile in Kyiv, Blinken and Austin met with Zelensky, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and Interior Minister Denys Monastrysky for an extended, roughly 90-minute bilateral meeting, the senior State Department official said.\n\nRELATED: Live Updates: Russia’s war in Ukraine\n\nAs part of the resumed US diplomatic presence in Ukraine, diplomats will “start with day trips into the Lviv” and “will graduate to potentially other parts of the country and ultimately, to resume presence in Kyiv,” according to a senior State Department official.\n\nBlinken and Austin discussed the Biden administration’s intention to provide $713 million in additional foreign military financing to Ukraine and allied European and Balkan partners, according to the senior State Department official and a senior Defense Department official. Part of that new military assistance funding will help Ukraine transition to NATO-capable systems, the State Department official said. The two secretaries also discussed deliveries of recent US military assistance to Ukraine and the ongoing training for Ukrainian soldiers, the officials said.\n\nBiden on Monday announced that he will nominate Bridget Brink as US ambassador to Ukraine. The post that has been without a confirmed ambassador since Marie Yovanovitch was recalled in May 2019. Brink is the current US ambassador to Slovakia.\n\nZelensky’s office issued a readout of the meeting on Monday, stressing the importance of the visit and saying the country “counts on the support of our partners.”\n\n“We appreciate the unprecedented assistance of the United States to Ukraine,” Zelensky said, according to the readout. “I would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, for his personal clear position. To thank all the American people, as well as the Congress for their bicameral and bipartisan support. We see it. We feel it.”\n\nOfficials reiterate no involvement by US forces\n\nThe traveling US press corps did not travel with the secretaries to the Ukrainian capital. In a background briefing, the State and Defense officials made clear that the US military would still not be involved directly in the war.\n\n“The President has been very clear there will be no US troops fighting in Ukraine and that includes the skies over Ukraine,” the defense official said, adding, “This visit does not portend actual involvement by US forces.”\n\nIn the Monday press briefing, Austin said the US believes Ukraine can win the war against Russia with “the right equipment and the right support.”\n\n“In terms of their ability to win – the first step in winning is believing that you can win.

We believe that we – they – can win, if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can and continue to do everything we can,” Austin told reporters.\n\nHe said, “we’re going to push as hard as we can as quickly as we can to get them what they need”, adding that the nature of the fight between Ukraine and Russia has evolved. He said “they’re now focused on is a different type of terrain. So they need long-range fire.”\n\nWhile officials hailed the trip as a testament to the US commitment to Ukraine, they have also faced questions about why Biden did not make the trip himself.\n\n“The President of the United States is somewhat singular, in terms of what travel would require.

Another tranche of about 50 Ukrainians will also begin training soon, the defense official said.\n\n“The first tranche of artillery training is complete,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Sunday who traveled to the region with the secretaries in a briefing in Poland. “We train soldiers that will go back, and their colleagues will be able to follow and be all in on systems.”\n\nSome of the howitzers included in the most recent military assistance package for Ukraine are already in the country, the defense official said. The howitzers are expected to be effective at this stage of the war as it’s shifted to the Donbas, where the terrain is suited to “long range” weaponry, Kirby said.\n\nKirby noted the speed with which the military assistance shipments has arrived in Ukraine and said that the decision for how to deploy the assistance is up to the Ukrainians.\n\n“It’s not taking more than 24 to 48 hours depending on what’s being shipped and the availability of ground transportation to get it into Ukraine,” Kirby said. “As we’ve said before, when (the assistance is) transferred to Ukrainian hands, it’s Ukrainian property, and we are not dictating to them how fast they get it to the front line or what units get them.”\n\nMilitary officials described to reporters the ongoing concern among NATO countries about the threat that Russia poses to them.\n\n“Not just here in Poland, I think many of the countries are concerned about Russia’s next steps,” said Lt.

The move came despite a federal judge blocking the deportation Saturday and ordering deportation planes be turned around.\n\nLeavitt said the Trump administration complied with the judge’s order, arguing the Venezuelans were deported before the judge’s written order was released.

Is it going to be all Venezuelans or all Mexicans, or is it members of a particular gang? How's this going to be used in an individual case? Who will be subject to it?

Boasberg held a 5 p.m. hearing where he expanded the order to cover all Venezuelans under the act that targets alleged members of the crime gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nTwo deportation flights left Harlingen, Texas: at 5:26 p.m. Eastern headed to Comayagua, Honduras, and at 5:45 p.m. Eastern headed to San Salvador, El Salvador, according to a filing by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward Foundation. The flights landed at 7:36 p.m. Eastern and 8:02 p.m. Eastern, respectively.\n\nBoasberg’s oral order to turn around planes headed to other countries came between 6:45 p.m. and 6:48 p.m. Eastern, according to the lawyers.\n\nBoasberg said during the hearing that “any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”\n\nGovernment lawyers said in a filing Sunday the five initial plaintiffs weren't deported. The filing said Boasberg’s order was published in the online court docket at 7:26 p.m. Eastern and that “some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation has already been removed from United States territory” before the second, oral order.\n\nThe lawyers asked Boasberg to review whether the government complied with his order.\n\n“If that is how the government proceeded, it was a blatant violation of the Court’s Order,” the lawyers wrote.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump justifies Alien Enemies Act because of ‘invasion’\n\nPresident Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which has been linked to contract killings, kidnapping and organized crime.\n\nThe law says a president can invoke it during “a declared war” with a foreign nation or government, or when “any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted or threatened” against the United States. The law had previously been invoked only three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\n\nCongress hasn’t declared a war. But Trump told reporters while flying from Florida back to Washington on Sunday that he considered this a “a time of war” because foreign criminals entered the country without legal authorization during previous administrations.\n\n\"This is a time of war, because Biden allowed millions of people, many of them criminals, many of them at the highest level, they emptied jails out,” Trump said. “That's an invasion. They invaded our country.”\n\n“In that sense, this is war,” Trump added. “In many respects, it's more dangerous than war because, you know, in war, they have uniforms. You know who you're shooting at. You know you're going after.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhy were hundreds of Venezuelans deported?\n\nChief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg initially ordered the administration Saturday not to deport five Venezuelans who were fighting their removal from the United States. He later expanded the order to cover all Venezuelans being deported under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nBut flight logs suggest at least two deportation flights bound for Honduras and El Salvador might have taken off or landed after Boasberg issued his second oral order.\n\nThe Trump administration has asked the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt Boasberg's order while the case is litigated. The appeals court asked for written arguments Tuesday from the government and Wednesday from Venezuelans. Boasberg postponed a Monday hearing until Friday because of the appeal.\n\nGovernment lawyers said in a filing Sunday that “some gang members” had “already been removed from United States territory” under Trump’s proclamation and before the court’s second order.\n\nLawyers representing the Venezuelans from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democracy Forward Foundation asked Boasberg in a filing early Monday to review whether the government obeyed his order.\n\nMark Zaid, a national security lawyer who has represented whistleblowers against the Trump administration and whose security clearance Trump rescinded, said the potential defiance of a court order moves the country closer to a \"constitutional crisis.\"\n\n-Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/12/ice-immigration-protests-live-updates/84157140007/", "title": "Court blocks ruling requiring Trump to return control of National Guard", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on the growing protests against ICE raids and President Donald Trump's immigration policies from Thursday, June 12.

He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,\" Breyer wrote in his 36-page ruling.\n\nIn a news conference following the ruling, Newsom said he was \"gratified by the order.\" The governor added that troops would be redeployed to their previous duties, such as border security, drug enforcement, and vegetation and forest management.\n\n“Today was really about a test of democracy and today we passed the test — we the people passed the test,” Newsom said.\n\nCalifornia AG says federal judge's ruling is an 'early success'\n\nDuring a virtual news conference on Thursday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the temporary restraining order an \"early success,\" but noted that \"it’s far from the end of the road.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal and requested the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to block Breyer’s ruling.\n\nThe next hearing with Breyer in the case is scheduled for 10 a.m. PT on June 20. According to the ruling, the Trump administration must \"show cause\" for why Breyer should not issue a preliminary injunction.\n\nNewsom: Judge waiting for evidence of Marines’ deployment\n\nNewsom said he believed Breyer is waiting for evidence that the Marines have \"actually been deployed\" to Los Angeles.\n\n\"They appear not to be,\" Newsom said at Thursday’s news conference. \"They’re not coordinating with anybody on this, so he’s just waiting for that evidence.\"\n\nThe governor added that the Marines have been moved to another location for training exercises and have not been deployed to the city. The military previously said about 700 Marines will be on the streets of Los Angeles by Thursday or Friday.\n\nNewsom also criticized the Trump administration's actions, including intensifying immigration raids and the forceful removal of Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference in Los Angeles earlier on Thursday.\n\n“The notion that the United States active duty Marines, these heroes, would be used to militarize the streets of an American city is an abomination,” Newsom said. \"The Founding Fathers did not live and die to see that happen in this country for no reason whatsoever other than vanity theater to instill fear, to incite a response.\"\n\nHegseth won't say he'll respect ruling on LA deployment\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to say Thursday whether he would respect any court's ruling if it put major limitations on Guard troops and Marines deploying in Los Angeles.\n\nThe military's mission in recent days has been expanded to include the protection of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting the raids prompted by Trump's directive to find immigrants living in the United States without legal status. The sweeps prompted days of protests, and demonstrations and rallies have spread across the nation.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-California, asked Hegseth at a congressional hearing Thursday to \"assure the American people\" he would respect any ruling from the Supreme Court or district courts of sending the military to crack down on protests against Trump's immigration enforcement sweeps.\n\n\"We should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\" Hegseth responded.\n\n\"You're not willing to say you would respect those decisions?\" Khanna asked.\n\n\"What I'm saying is local district judges shouldn't make foreign policy for the United States,\" Hegseth shot back.\n\nSen. Padilla removed from Homeland Security Secretary’s news conference\n\nPadilla was forcibly removed from a news conference put on by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid mass protests over the administration’s immigration crackdown. As Padilla started asking Noem a question, he was grabbed by security guards.\n\n“I am Senator Alex Padilla, I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla said as he was hauled from the room where Noem was speaking.\n\nAfter being dragged away, the senator was pushed to the ground and handcuffed. Noem said during the news conference that she doesn’t know Padilla and that he hadn’t requested a meeting with her.\n\n“So when I leave here I’ll have a conversation with him and visit and find out really what his concerns were,” she said. “I think everybody in America would agree that wasn’t appropriate.”\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\n'Unhinged': Democrats furious Padilla was hauled out of Noem briefing\n\nWASHINGTON – The fury radiating off of Congressional Democrats is palpable.\n\nHours after Padilla, the senior U.S. senator in California, was forcibly removed from a press briefing with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, House Democrats roamed the Capitol seeking an audience with GOP leadership. Meanwhile, their Senate counterparts gave floor speech after floor speech, condemning the action as an \"abuse of power\" and \"assault.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called Padilla's actions \"wildly inappropriate\" and alleged he rushed at the secretary. House Democrats shouted over him, saying, \"That's a lie!\"\n\n\"Anybody that looks at that video will understand that this amounts to an assault, a felony,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \"The White House is unhinged and out of control.\"\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, a string of Democratic senators delivered floor speeches hammering the indignity of the episode.\n\n“I saw this happen to my colleague, and I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration . . . What is the becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do?” said New Jersey Democrat Sen. Andy Kim on the Senate floor.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Riley Beggin\n\nTrump, Newsom joust ahead of crucial court hearing\n\nIn an interview released Thursday with \"The Daily,\" a New York Times podcast, Newsom slammed President Donald Trump and called the decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles \"theatre\" and \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nNewsom said local police are protecting the deployed National Guard troops while also handling the protests − \"just think about how perverse that is.\"\n\nTrump, in a Truth Social post Thursday, said the city was \"safe and sound\" thanks in part to the Guard.\n\n\"Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the L.A. Police in a position to effectively do their job,\" Trump wrote Thursday. \"They all worked well together, but without the Military, Los Angeles would be a crime scene like we haven’t seen in years.\"\n\nThe LAPD did report incidents of unrest the last two nights, and arrests were made. Demonstrators late Wednesday threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, police said.\n\nNewsom, who has repeatedly decried the military intervention as an illegal waste of resources that provoked unrest, ultimately wants the National Guard returned to state control and Trump's actions declared illegal.\n\n\"Governor Gaven NewScum had totally lost control of the situation,\" Trump wrote Thursday, mocking the governor. \"He should be saying THANK YOU for saving his ass, instead of trying to justify his mistakes and incompetence!!!\"\n\nNewsom shrugged off the recurring \"NewScum\" reference, telling \"The Daily\" it was \"what I think a seventh grader used to call me.\"\n\nHundreds arrested in LA protests as Hegseth hints at more deployments: Updates\n\nMarine share photos of training on Instagram\n\nThe U.S. Marines deploying to Los Angeles are sharing photos of their training on Instagram.\n\nPhotos shared on the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment’s page 2ndbn7thmarhistory show Marines training with riot shields and wearing what appear to be baseball catcher’s leg guards.\n\n“U.S. Marines with 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, attached to Task Force 51, rehearse non-lethal tactics in Los Angeles, June 11, 2025,” the caption reads. “U.S. Northern Command is supporting federal agencies by providing military forces to protect federal functions, personnel, and property in the greater Los Angeles area.”\n\nNorthern Command which directs the Marines said in an update Thursday that the troops \"are conducting mission orientation and familiarization today.\"\n\nTrump vows to protect farm, hotel workers in raids\n\nTrump said he plans to make changes to his administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration to protect migrant farmers, hotel workers and others in the leisure industry who have been among those deported. Trump promised the changes in a Truth Social post that acknowledged ICE officers have not only targeted violent criminals, who Trump officials have said are the primary focus of raids and deportations.\n\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform he owns.

A similar situation unfolded in Tucson, Arizona, where law enforcement deployed tear gas and took several protesters into custody.\n\nThis week, hundreds of people have been arrested during protests across the country, including in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago, and Austin, Texas.\n\nTucson protest sees multiple arrests, tear gas\n\nIn Tucson, Arizona, a group of about 300 protesters marched to the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where the rally grew tense and erupted into clashes and arrests on June 11.\n\nSome of the protesters threw paint balls and water bottles at the office’s security guards, who responded with flash bangs and pepper spray. Soon after, protesters blocked a nearby road, onlookers said. Police in riot gear arrived to disperse them and three people were taken into custody.\n\nChristina Benitez, a local teacher and Mexican American, was at the protest with her friend. They held signs reading “ICE out of our city” and “Defend the Constitution.\"\n\n“There is no excuse to quash the public with ICE and the Marines and the National Guard,” she told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. “That is contrary to everything our nation was founded upon, the right of assembly.”\n\n– Sarah Lapidus, Arizona Republic\n\nProtesters in Detroit rally against immigration enforcement\n\nA small but vocal group of demonstrators rallied Wednesday, June 11, outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in Detroit to oppose ongoing immigration raids and deportations.\n\nAccording to activists, five or six individuals – most of them believed to be Venezuelan – were detained after their immigration cases were dismissed in court.\n\n\"That's happening more and more. Regardless of the outcome, people have been snatched up straight out of court – and we've known people that this has happened to,\" Kate Stenvig, a local organizer, told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nNicole Conaway, a Detroit resident and local activist, believes what’s at stake goes beyond immigration policy. “If Trump can win this battle, then we're further down the road to fascism and him being a dictator,” she said.\n\n– Nour Rahal, Detroit Free Press\n\nSpokane mayor declared state of emergency amid anti-ICE protest\n\nPolice in Spokane, Washington, arrested more than 30 people and the mayor issued a state of emergency after a protest against immigration enforcement on June 11 escalated.\n\nThe protest formed after organizers heard two Venezuelan men were detained at a local U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, where one of them was slated to a check-in after he had applied for asylum, reported KREM2.\n\nProtesters tried to block the truck that was supposedly meant to take the men to an ICE facility in Tacoma, local outlets reported. The crowd outside the ICE field office began to swell and local law enforcement declared it an unlawful assembly. Officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls into the crowd before it dispersed.\n\nSpokane Mayor Lisa Brown declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew for a section of the downtown area from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. At a news conference, Kevin Hall, chief of the Spokane Police Department, said over 30 protesters were arrested.\n\nAnti-ICE protesters rally outside NBA Finals game\n\nThe roar of cheers and chants could be heard outside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis just before Game 3 of the NBA Finals, but it wasn't the sound of basketball fans. It was people gathered to protest ICE raids in Indiana.\n\nThe crowd swelled to more than a thousand people before it broke up, organizers said, although Indianapolis police put the count at around 500. The protest was prompted by rumors online that ICE raids had taken place in the nearby city of Lawrence. Local police said it wasn't aware of any U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions there.\n\nThe demonstration remained nonviolent, and one speaker reminded demonstrators not to antagonize the police. Protesters held signs reading \"ICE out of Indy now\" and \"Power to the workers not the billionaires.\" Some basketball fans on their way to the game responded to the protesters with chants of \"USA.\"\n\nResident Jaqueline Montez, 30, said it was important to her to protest now rather than wait for planned \"No Kings Day\" protests downtown and nationwide on June 14. “We’re being seen by the rest of the world,” Montez told the Indianapolis Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. “We’re being noticed today.”\n\n– Jade Jackson, Noe Padilla, and Matthew Cupelli, Indianapolis Star\n\nNewsom takes shot at defense secretary on social media\n\nNewsom posted a photo on X of National Guard troops sleeping on the floor and another image, posted by the official Defense Department's Rapid Response account, of a baseball game.\n\n\"Pete sent 4,700 troops here (when they weren’t needed) without adequate fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. But don’t worry, he’s at a baseball game,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nRapid Response quickly responded on X, posting a photo of a protester waving a Mexican flag as a fire burns. The post says: \"Weren't needed.\"\n\nThe military's Northern Command said in a statement Wednesday that the military has contracted for billeting, latrines, showers, food and laundry services and other items and services for the troops. The statement added that \"while awaiting fulfillment of the contract, soldiers and Marines have adequate shelter, food, and water.\"\n\nSome former military leaders siding with Newsom\n\nFormer secretaries of the Army and Navy, three retired admirals and two retired generals banded together to file an amicus brief in the Trump-Newsom litigation citing what they describe as \"critical national security risks\" inherent in Trump's deployment of military forces in Los Angeles.\n\nAmicus briefs are filed by people or organizations not directly involved in litigation but who take a position in the case. The group includes former Army Secretary Louis Caldera, a Democrat, and former Navy Secretary Sean O’Keefe, a Republican.\n\nThe brief says deploying the military for domestic law enforcement diverts them from their primary mission of national security and disaster response, that National Guard personnel and active duty Marines are not properly trained for such law enforcement operations, and that such a use of the military should be a \"last resort to avoid the politicization of the military, which inevitably erodes public trust, impacts recruitment, and undermines troop morale.\"\n\n'He's lost it': Newsom slams Trump's mental acuity, echoing president's criticism of Biden\n\nPolice say protesters throw fireworks, rocks at officers\n\nA one-square-mile of downtown Los Angeles remained under a curfew Thursday after days of demonstrations led to hundreds of arrests. The unrest continued Wednesday night, when police said demonstrators at one location threw \"commercial-grade fireworks and rocks\" at officers, resulting in a number of arrests.\n\nThe protests broke out on June 6 in response to ongoing ICE raids that have sparked fear among immigrant communities. While many protests have been relatively peaceful, some have turned into scenes of chaos as police fired \"less lethal\" munitions such as tear gas and flash-bangs to disperse crowds.\n\nWalz, Hochul, Pritzker to criticize immigration enforcement in House hearing\n\nHundreds of protests planned for June 14\n\nProtests are planned for 1,800 communities across the country on June 14, the same day Trump holds a military parade in Washington, D.C. For decades, the GOP has claimed most of the symbols of patriotism, including the American flag, but the people protesting Trump, a Republican, say they are the true patriots now.\n\nThe rallies, named \"No Kings Day\" to oppose what they see as Trump's power grab, are expected to be the largest and most numerous protests since Trump's second term began, dwarfing the Hands Off protests in early April that drew as many as 1 million Americans to the streets at more than 1,000 rallies.\n\nNo Kings Day was organized by grassroots groups in cities and towns of all sizes to coincide with the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary celebration, which is also Trump’s 79th birthday and Flag Day. Administration officials insist it is a coincidence that the parade falls on Trump's birthday.

{"question_id": "20251003_5", "search_time": "2025/10/04/01:26", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/27/trump-tariffs-auto-car-prices-go-up-april-3-go-into-effect/82686861007/", "title": "Trump auto tariffs go into effect April 3: Info on car prices, sales", "text": "President Donald Trump made official Wednesday his long-promised tariffs for the automotive industry, imposing a 25% import tariff on all cars, light-duty trucks and some car parts imported into the U.S. Trump argued the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing by forcing American automakers to build cars in the U.S.\n\nThe presidential proclomation enacting the tariffs goes into effect April 3. Here's what we know about the automotive tariffs so far:\n\nWhat are tariffs?\n\nPut simply, tariffs are additional taxes placed on imported goods to make those goods look undesirable to consumers in the U.S. Import tariffs historically have been used to try and boost sales of domestic products.\n\nManufacturers and producers of goods, however, typically pass price increases onto the consumer.\n\nWill auto tariffs raise car prices?\n\nAnalysts say the import tariffs aren't guaranteed to boost domestic production and sales of vehicles, but are likely to raise car prices for buyers.\n\n\"You're going to see price increases,\" Ivan Drury, director of insights at automotive research site Edmunds, told USA TODAY. \"It's such a shotgun approach. Virtually nothing goes unscathed.\"\n\nIn February, automotive analysts told the Free Press that a previous iteration of Trump's tariffs could raise vehicle prices anywhere from $1,000 to $9,000.\n\nThe average price for a new car was $48,039 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nWhile the auto tariffs target imported vehicles, prices of domestic cars could also increase, because the executive order also applies to some car parts, and domestic automakers import some of the components for their vehicles.\n\nWill auto tariffs affect used car prices?\n\nTypically, when the prices of new cars rise, the prices of used cars increase as well, Kelly Blue Book noted. Buyers hoping to avoid the higher cost of a new car could look for a deal on a used car, but if more buyers turn to pre-owned vehicles, the entire used car market could inflate.\n\nAccording to automotive analytics group CarGurus, the average price of a used car has slightly ticked up over the past month after months of decreases. The average used car price was $27,046 on Wednesday, according to CarGurus, down nearly 3% since November but higher than it was at the start of February, when the average used car price was $26,910.\n\nWill auto tariffs affect car sales?\n\nMost likely — analysts say the automotive market will take a hit due to the tariffs.\n\nCox Automotive, an Atlanta-based software and analytics company, had initially predicted 16.3 million cars would be sold in the U.S. this year, but now predicts 700,000 fewer cars will be sold in the U.S. this year because of uncertainty related to tariffs, the Free Press reported.\n\nIn 2024, there were an estimated 15.9 million sales of new vehicles, according to Wards Intelligence. That was the highest figure since 2019, and a 2.2% increase from 2023, Reuters reported.\n\nHow have automakers reacted?\n\nThe automotive industry generally has pushed against Trump's tariff plan, largely due to the volatility tariffs will create for the car market.\n\nThe Free Press has reported that executives from major automakers, including Detroit's Ford and General Motors, were either traveling to Washington or meeting remotely with members of the Trump Administration in an effort to stave off the tariffs. Trump previously delayed tariffs on auto parts from Mexico and Canada imported by domestic automakers, but said Wednesday the looming tariffs set by the executive order would not be postponed again. \"This is permanent, 100%,\" he said.\n\nContact Arpan Lobo: alobo@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/04/20/trump-tariff-trade-wars-2028-china-economy/83096052007/", "title": "Will the Trump tariff wars end by 2028?

Imagine trying to predict where import taxes will stand in 2028.\n\nAnd yet, that’s exactly what we asked four experts to do.\n\nTrump has enacted a flurry of tariffs in the early days of his administration. Tax rates now range from zero (on certain exempted products, such as duty-free items from Canada and Mexico) to more than 100% (on many imports from China, among other trade targets).\n\nTariff policy seems to shift almost daily. It’s tough to predict where the rates will sit in a week, let alone in three years, at the end of Trump’s term.\n\nBut it’s a question worth asking. Consumers want to plan future car and iPhone buys. Retailers want to predict where prices are headed on clothing and computers. Manufacturers want to divine where to build their next factory.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nWe asked four economists and academicians to predict what Trump’s tariff policy may look like in 2028, and what factors might shape it.\n\nHere’s what they told us. These are their comments in full, edited for clarity.\n\nColin Grabow, associate director, Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, Cato Institute\n\nNo crystal ball is needed to see that tariffs will almost certainly be higher in 2028 than when President Trump took office in January − the only question is by how much. Another outcome would be deeply surprising. For America, the tariff man cometh.\n\nBetween his first term and the early days of his second, Trump has managed to bury the United States under an avalanche of tariffs. The onslaught has been so extensive that the United States now has its highest average tariff rate in over a century − and more seem on the way. Digging the United States out of this mess will take some doing.\n\nUnfortunately, few seem eager to grab shovels.\n\nCongressional Republicans are highly reluctant to cross a leader who remains incredibly popular within the party, while Democrats have traditionally been more supportive of protectionist policies favored by organized labor. Assembling a veto-proof coalition to restore sanity to US tariff policy is a tall order.\n\nAbsent such an intervention, President Trump’s de facto tariff switch is likely to remain in the 'on' position. Although some relief could be found in 'deals' with certain countries, or as part of a market-calming exercise, a complete unwinding is deeply improbable.\n\nJosh Bivens, chief economist, Economic Policy Institute\n\nIn 2028, average tariffs could be 5% − about double their level when Trump took office. Or they could be 25%, or even higher than that.\n\nThe fact that nobody can say with any certainty where tariff rates will be is absolute poison for every business and family in America trying to make plans for their future.\n\nShould you build a new factory? Buy a new home? Take out loans for your kids’ college? Choose a different industry to work in? All these crucial decisions depend on the state of America’s interconnectedness with the rest of the world.\n\nUntil this is clarified − and truly clarified, not subject to the ever-changing whims of one man − all Americans will be held in limbo, and this will crush economic growth.\n\nMost economic policies create winners and losers. The Trump tariff policy is almost entirely creating losers, unless some insiders are timing their stock market purchases around advanced knowledge about new announcements and pauses. What was once unthinkably dumb and corrupt now seems entirely possible.\n\nBernard Yaros, lead U.S. economist, Oxford Economics\n\nIt’s difficult, if not impossible, to know where tariffs will end up in 2028. However, a safe bet would be to assume that the significantly higher tariffs on China will remain in effect, as decoupling from the world’s second-largest economy seems to be one of the administration’s clearest goals amid the chaotic rollout of reciprocal tariffs this month.\n\nSector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts, and others will likely stick as well. Yet, it’s probable that the across-the-board reciprocal tariffs on all countries other than China and all products outside certain sectors will either get significantly watered down or go away by 2028.\n\nThe administration could water down these reciprocal tariffs via further exemptions, targeted toward consumer goods, in a bid to mitigate the inflationary impact.\n\nOn the other side of the 2026 midterms, you could craft a scenario in which enough lawmakers on both sides of the aisle turn against the reciprocal tariffs and a supermajority in both chambers of Congress overrides a presidential veto to vote down the reciprocal tariffs.\n\nRobert Gulotty, associate professor of political science, University of Chicago\n\nIn 2028, the Trump administration will be in campaign mode and may be trying to take actions that limit blowback from tariffs.\n\nIn the previous Trump administration, this meant using ad hoc authorities to allocate billions of dollars of cash to farm communities affected by Chinese retaliation.\n\nMy research with Anton Strezhnev suggests that those efforts moved voters in the 2020 election, particularly in rural communities. They will likely try again.\n\nWe also saw reversals on the tariffs themselves, as exemptions on steel and aluminum were granted to Canada and Mexico in advance of the approval of a renegotiated NAFTA.\n\nHowever, I worry new cash disbursements and targeted tariff exemptions will have little effect on the overall state of trade policy for the U.S.\n\nUnless things dramatically change by 2028, the world will have gone through four years of dramatic and unpredictable policy swings. Measures of formal trade restrictions, like the average tariff, mean little for firms that cannot guess whether their customers will face a tax or not.\n\nThere may be an appetite for some kind of global deal to reduce this uncertainty, but who would bother negotiating a treaty with a government that is unconstrained by scraps of paper?\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/01/tariffs-trump-markets-economy-live-updates/82741953007/", "title": "Tariffs updates: Republican senators to rebuke Trump on Canada tax", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Trump's tariffs for Tuesday, April 1. For the latest news, view our story for Wednesday, April 2.\n\nIn what would be a rebuke to President Donald Trump, a Senate resolution to end the emergency declaration enabling tariffs against Canada is likely to have enough Republican votes to pass the chamber, according to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky.\n\nPaul is co-sponsoring the resolution with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, who wants to force GOP lawmakers to go on the record on the policy. Trump implemented the emergency declaration in February to put tariffs on Canada for not going far enough to stop fentanyl from crossing into the United States.\n\nCanadian officials have said fentanyl seizures by U.S. agents at the northern border made up less than 0.1% of total U.S. seizures of the drug from 2022 to 2024.\n\nPaul and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have publicly said they will vote for the resolution. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said she is likely to support it. Paul told reporters Tuesday afternoon that a fourth Republican is likely to vote in favor, though he would not say who.\n\n\"I think government by emergency rule is a mistake,'' Paul said. \"The power to tax they say is the power to destroy. The power to tax is considered one of the most important powers and so it was given to Congress. ... I think it's probably one of the more important votes that we'll have maybe in a generation.\"\n\nThe outcome wouldn't stop Trump from imposing the tax on Canadian goods because the resolution would have to pass the House to be binding. With a slim majority in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson likely wouldn't risk bringing it up for a vote.\n\nKaine said Tuesday morning the Senate vote would probably be delayed until Wednesday − when Trump plans to unveil his controversial global tariffs − because of the marathon floor speech by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Trump administration froze several dozen research grants with Princeton University without a concrete explanation, school president Christopher Eisgruber said in an e-mail to the campus community, the latest instance of the president targeting institutions of higher learning. The federal government has also suspended funding for Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania and put Harvard contracts and grants under review. The administration has accused some schools of not doing enough to combat antisemitism.\n\n∎ Former Costa Rican President and Nobel Prize winner Oscar Arias said the U.S. revoked his visa to enter the country weeks after he said on social media that Trump was acting like \"a Roman emperor.\"\n\n∎ Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said he has begun a process to remove remaining tariffs on U.S. imports, which would need the approval of Economy Minister Nir Barkat.\n\nTrump willing to negotiate on tariffs, White House says\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that Trump could potentially negotiate lower tariffs with companies or countries if they change policies, but he aims to end trade imbalances that have gone on for decades.\n\n“The ultimate change for these companies and these countries will happen when they decide to do business in the United States,” Leavitt said. “Certainly the president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation, but he is very much focused on fixing the wrongs of the past.”\n\nBesides Canada negotiating potentially lower tariffs with the Commerce Department, a number of other countries are calling Trump, Leavitt said.\n\n“If they want to be absolved of that tariff, they can come to the United States of America to do business, bring their jobs here,” she said. In the administration's view, Leavitt said, “Too many foreign countries have their markets closed to our exports.”\n\nTariffs rates set, will be announced Wednesday\n\nTrump has finalized the tariff rates he will impose Wednesday on imports from countries across the world, Leavitt said. The press secretary declined to say Tuesday whether Trump has landed at 20% tariffs for most imports to the U.S., as the Washington Post reported White House aides have explored.\n\n“The president said last night he has made a decision and a determination (on the rates). I was with him in the Oval Office earlier, and he is going to announce that decision tomorrow,” Leavitt said.\n\n“He is with his trade and tariff team right now perfecting,'' she said.\n\nLeavitt said the tariffs will go into effect immediately, and collections on the duties begins Thursday.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House: Americans should 'trust' Trump on tariffs\n\nTrump and other administration officials have dismissed the warnings of many economists that tariffs will drive up prices and possibly tumble the nation into recession, arguing the duties will prompt foreign companies to invest in U.S. projects to avoid the import taxes.\n\nLeavitt said the administration is working to reduce the cost of living, pointing to regulation changes at the Environmental Protection Agency and policies to unleash American energy she said would bring down costs.\n\n“You should trust what this president did for you in his first term,” Leavitt said. “He effectively utilized tariffs while driving down inflation.”\n\nRepublicans have largely stood by Trump as he implemented the tariffs, though many have said they're worried the economic ramifications will hurt people in their states.\n\nWhat time is Trump's tariff announcement April 2?\n\nTrump will formally introduce the tariffs at a 4 p.m. event in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. It will be his first event in the storied space just outside the Oval Office since he returned to power.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on Fox News on Monday evening, said the tariffs would be followed by tax breaks Trump promised during his run for office − such as no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security and a tax deduction for purchasing an American car.\n\n\"For the first time in decades ... we are going to make the global trading system fair for American workers,\" Bessent said.\n\nHouse speaker defends tariffs: 'Will make sense for Americans'\n\nJohnson told reporters Tuesday morning that Trump's plans to implement massive tariffs on the United States' former trading allies \"makes a lot of common sense.\"\n\nThe trade disparities that began after World War II are over, Johnson argued, and there is now a much more integrated global economy.\n\n\"The president is absolutely right when he says that we have to think about America's interests first,\" Johnson said. He later added: \"It may be rocky in the beginning, but I think that this will make sense for Americans and it will help all Americans.\"\n\nReport: Most imports could face 20% tariffs\n\nWhite House aides have drafted plans for 20% tariffs on most goods imported to the United States, the Washington Post reported Tuesday. White House advisers cautioned that several options remain in play.\n\nTrump said Sunday that reciprocal tariffs will target all nations that impose duties on U.S. goods, and the White House said Monday that any country that has treated Americans unfairly should expect to receive a tariff.\n\nFinancial markets may not be soothed by Trump announcement\n\nU.S. stocks closed a choppy session mostly higher Tuesday, a day after March closed with the largest monthly declines in more than two years for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, and a day before the extent of Trump's large-scale tariffs is revealed.\n\nJason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Wednesday's announcement may not calm the unsettled markets.\n\n\"As much as investors might hope for it, this is unlikely to put an end to tariff uncertainty,\" Draho said. \"Uncertainty and market volatility are likely to stay high in the near term as investors recalibrate their outlooks after these events.\"\n\nBessent said the tariffs, combined with tax breaks and corporate investment, will push the economy to new heights. “There's been a line through the Oval Office of countries and companies who want to bring capital, jobs and factories to the United States,\" Bessent said.\n\nLayoffs begin at Health and Human Services\n\nThe Trump administration began firing staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday, the beginning of a plan to cut 10,000 jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.\n\nAn FDA employee said staff had to present their badges at the building entrance and those who had been fired were given paperwork and told to return home, according to one source. Combined with HHS employees who previously accepted buyouts and others who were already fired, the agency's workforce will be sliced by one-quarter from 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000 since Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader plan by Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk to shrink staffing levels in federal departments and agencies.\n\nWhy is Trump calling April 2 'Liberation Day'\n\nTrump has referred to April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" since he assumed the nation's highest office in January. The president has pledged to enact reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners as well as scores of other nations that contribute to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit.\n\nTrump's motive is to use tariffs as a way to force other countries to lower their own tariffs on U.S. goods and services, so as to create a more balanced economic playing field for U.S. exports and to create a strong incentive for companies to manufacture goods such as cars inside the U.S. to avoid paying the tax. The administration has already announced 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, on imported automobiles and automobile parts and on goods from Mexico and Canada.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that April 2 \"is a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries.\"\n\n− James Powell and Todd Spangler\n\nAre any cars actually 100% American?\n\nTrump said he wants to spur more manufacturing in the United States with his new tariff targeting foreign car imports, but defining an American-made car isn’t easy. Online automotive marketplace Cars.com found just over half of new inventory vehicles saw final assembly in the U.S. About 19% were assembled in Mexico, 4.2% in Canada and 1.4% in China, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\n\"No cars are actually 100% made in the United States, with parts sourced from the United States,” Edmunds consumer insights analyst Joseph Yoon said. “It’s going to be a big, big deal for the auto industry, globally, if the tariffs are implemented and enforced at face value.” Read more here.\n\n− Bailey Schulz\n\nTariffs 101: Who pays for them?\n\nTariffs are primarily levied on imports, typically to protect industries in the country levying them. Tariffs make imports more expensive, thus making local goods cheaper by comparison. Tariffs also can provide income that can be used to support local industries, fund public programs or cover government expenditures.\n\nAnd they can serve as bargaining tools to win concessions from trading partners.\n\n\"While tariffs may seem to penalize foreign producers by making their goods or services less competitive, the reality is that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately bear the cost,\" the Wilson Center scholars Diego Marroquín Bitar and Valeria Moy write in a \"Tariffs 101\" analysis.\n\nE.J. Antoni, a public finance economist and senior fellow at the conservative Committee to Unleash Prosperity, disagrees, saying in his opinion piece for Fox News earlier this month that economic history shows tariffs are always at least partly paid for by exporters, not just customers.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2025/03/27/auto-industry-tariffs-cost/82687247007/", "title": "Trump auto tariffs are unrealistic, raise costs by $100B, analysts say", "text": "Many analysts believe the tariffs will be met with retaliation and won't stick due to dramatic cost increases.\n\nDealers have adequate supply of vehicles for now.\n\nExperts predict there will be manufacturing shifts by automakers.\n\nThe fallout was still settling over the auto industry Thursday morning — just hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on all vehicles imported into the United States — as car dealers, analysts and industry leaders struggled to make sense of how this new cost will impact them.\n\nThe confusion is around the fact that, even though American-made vehicles are exempt from a tariff, there is no such thing as a truly American-made vehicle. Even the most American-made car contains a good percentage of parts imported from other countries. Those parts could now be subject to 25% taxes paid by the importers, in this case the car companies, to bring them over the U.S. border. Parts that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are exempt, but only for now.\n\nOn Thursday, many analysts said they believe these tariffs cannot realistically stick, even though Trump insisted they are permanent. And many experts struggled to predict the ultimate impact it could have for automakers, suppliers and even consumers because of uncertainty around to what exactly the tariffs will apply and how they will be implemented.\n\n“We’re assuming that they’re going to go by percentage of content and the tariff will be on that portion of it, but I’ve heard nothing from the factory yet because I assume they’re still scrambling to figure out what is happening,\" said Gordon Stewart, owner of car dealership Gordon Chevrolet in Garden City.\n\nOne thing seems unanimous among analysts, however: No matter where the car is made, these tariffs will increase the price of new cars by thousands of dollars because automakers cannot absorb all of the cost increases the tariffs will bring. The notion of shifting parts production to the United States is not realistic because many parts cannot be made here. In addition, it costs billions of dollars and takes at least three years to build a new factory.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n\"If truly 'permanent,' a 25% tariff on all imports into the U.S. market would represent a significant (if not unprecedented) increase in the prices of cars, effectively inflating the average price of a vehicle by 11% or 12% (all else equal) and raising the average monthly auto loan payment from approximately $750/month to $830 or $840/month,\" wrote Morgan Stanley autos analyst Adam Jonas in a Thursday morning research note. \"Actual impact will depend on a number of factors, including the role of finance subs (and captives) on leasing and loan terms. This will be the first and most obvious reaction to a tariff implementation of this magnitude.\"\n\nLonger term, Jonas said, the tariffs could create the \"Cubanization\" of vehicles in the States, referring to how in Cuban people keep their cars for many years, sometimes decades, because buying a new car is so expensive because of a U.S. trade embargo.\n\nExamples of US-made cars impact\n\nThe Detroit Three automakers declined to comment, referring the Detroit Free Press to a statement by the American Automotive Policy Council, the group that represents the automakers in Washington.\n\n\"U.S. automakers are committed to President Trump’s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the administration on durable policies that help Americans,\" said former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the AAPC, in the statement. \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President’s USMCA agreement,\" a reference to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during Trump's first term.\n\nNew car prices are expected to rise, experts predict. An example: BMW produces the X5 sport utility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. He said this model is one of the biggest exports in the United States auto sector with roughly 40% of production headed for outside markets. Currently, more than 68% of the vehicle’s components are imported, including the European-made engine and transmission.\n\n\"An applied tariff of 25% on those parts would add around $8,000 to the cost of making this vehicle and reducing the demand considerably as BMW would be forced to increase its price to all markets,\" Fiorani said.\n\nSimilarly, while Dearborn-based Ford Motor Co. assembles 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States domestically, it does get parts from other countries that go into those vehicles. It also sells vehicles made here in other countries. The Ford F-Series Super Duty pickup, for example, is assembled in Louisville, Kentucky, but all the gasoline V8 engines come from Windsor, Ontario, and the diesel V8s in it are made in Mexico, with other assorted parts also imported including the aluminum for the bodies, said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of Market Research at Telemetry Insights.\n\nAbuelsamid predicts the tariffs will drive the average new vehicle price up by 15%, he said.\n\nJeff Windau, industrials analyst at Edward Jones, told the Free Press that the Detroit Three are hurt somewhat less by the tariffs than are their foreign counterparts.\n\n“I would say they are all global companies and they do sell abroad, so you’ll start to see (retaliatory tariff) actions taken abroad that make them less competitive in these international markets,” Windau said. “They’ll have to look at their manufacturing footprint and supply chain and have to move some things around … which will probably raise prices for consumers and pressure sales in the industry. I feel everybody will be impacted.”\n\nDeutsche Bank's Edison Yu agreed that manufacturing shifts will be needed. In a research note Thursday, Yu wrote: \"Even if the tariffs are modified and/or exemptions are granted, the industry may not return to the status quo for the next four years.\"\n\nYu wrote that Tesla, which makes the most purely American-made vehicles, and Ford, are the most shielded from the tariffs, although Ford faces incremental exposure on imported engines.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in February that enduring 25% tariffs \"would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we've never seen.\"\n\n\"GM has the most exposure to Mexico,\" Yu wrote. \"On the suppliers, virtually all will be subject to the derivative impact of tariffs, in our view. We expect OEMs to evaluate footprints against model/profitability and assess production levels to align with economic sensibility, causing ... lower net volumes.\"\n\nLess production means fewer factory jobs.\n\n'Trying to hit a dancing target'\n\nAt Gordon Chevrolet, Stewart said he has about a 40-day supply of new cars on the ground, so he's not worried yet about the impact from the new tariff.\n\n“With all the fluctuations that have happened in the last 30 days, I’m not panicking yet,\" Stewart told the Free Press. \"All the uncertainties we’ve seen, I think everything is subject to change. There are still negotiations going on with Mexico. We’re, and by we, I mean General Motors, is still trying to hit a dancing target.”\n\nSimilarly, auto analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities pointed to the stock market Thursday morning where stock prices for the Detroit Three were taking a beating. He said the market is calling Trump's bluff.\n\n\"They're saying this is in pencil not pen,\" Ives told the Free Press. \"This (tariff) is not possible. The reality of enacting this is impossible. It’s a fictional tell. Even an American car made in America with American workers has foreign parts. There are parts of engines and parts of chips where they don’t have the parts in the United States, and it takes three years to build a factory. So how’s that going to work?\"\n\nIves predicts that new vehicle prices could rise by $5,000 to $10,000 to offset what automakers and suppliers will pay in tariffs either to import vehicles or parts. He derived that figure by looking at \"the parts sourced from the average car and half the cars in the United States are imported and 60% to 70% of cars have auto parts that are foreignly sourced.\"\n\nHe said his team estimates the tariffs will add $100 billion to $125 billion in costs across the entire auto industry.\n\nProtect the rich, annex Canada?\n\nIn early March, Trump postponed auto tariffs for 30 days. But on Wednesday, he said no more pauses in tariffs for the auto sector. \"This is permanent, 100%,\" he said.\n\nTrump said his executive order would force more automakers to move into the country and create jobs. The tariffs will take effect on or after 12:01 a.m. April 3 for automobiles, and on the \"date specified in the Federal Register for automobile parts,\" but no later than May 3.\n\nTrump said the tariff will help the auto industry to \"flourish\" and create new jobs as factories will start springing up stateside. An aide said the tariffs are expected to produce $100 billion a year in revenue for the federal government. Trump pegged it at potentially more than six times that over two years. That revenue could help to offset Trump keeping in place tax cuts passed in his first term, which are due to expire Dec. 31.\n\nBut the move also is an assault on Canada, which Trump is insistent about annexing in some fashion. Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Trump 25% tariffs would destroy Canada's economy.\n\nIn an emergency news conference Wednesday evening, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney condemned Trump's announcement as a \"direct attack\" on Canada's autoworkers.\n\n\"We have put in place the mechanisms where, if it is appropriate to put in place retaliatory tariffs ... we will take the steps that are in the interests of Canadian workers,\" Carney, who has called a snap election for April 28 after taking over for Trudeau. \"We are entirely aligned in terms of the seriousness we are taking this and the seriousness of our response.\"\n\nA Ford factory in Canada, devastated\n\nJohn D'Agnolo had a headache, a real, physical headache, Thursday morning from processing the tariff news.\n\nD'Agnolo is President of Unifor Local 200 in Windsor. His local represents some 2,000 workers at Ford's engine plants, which supply many of the engines used in the F-Series pickups that are made in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nHe told the Free Press on Thursday that Trump's tariffs imposed on Canada are completely unjustified.\n\n\"I am looking at what we continuously do, everything we've done in Canada to support the United States. It is a fair trade agreement, what we have today,\" D'Agnolo said. \"These are additional costs and it makes no sense.\"\n\nHe said Trump's move hurts U.S. citizens beyond autos. He said the connection Canada has with Michigan, its border locale, is like no other and it is being damaged.\n\n\"It makes me sick that he's doing this to Michigan to be honest, because now we're not going there anymore,\" D'Agnolo said. \"Who wants to isolate a country like that and destroy those businesses? This is more than about autos. I spent more money in Michigan than anywhere, I love that state. This is devastating.\"\n\nHe points to the fact that in 2024, Ford sold 134,000 F-Series pickups in Canada, all of which were made in the United States.\n\n\"I built the engine, but the trucks are all built there (in the United States),\" D'Agnolo said. \"How am I ripping them off? We don't build these vehicles in Canada and thousands of vehicles are built in the United States and I'm ripping him off? Am I frustrated? Yes. Is he lying? Yes. All it's doing is destroying lives on both sides of the border.\"\n\nD'Agnolo said Canada will be forced to protect itself by implementing retaliatory tariffs or requiring any vehicles sold in Canada be built in Canada. In the meantime, he is more worried than ever that Trump is serious about annexing Canada because \"he needs our natural resources.\"\n\n\"That's why he's looking at Greenland, looking at Ukraine,\" D'Agnolo said. \"We could build a chip plant in our country no problem because we have the resources to do that. He realizes battery is coming. He needs the lithium, we have the nickel and we have the cobalt. All the things he needs to make these batteries are in Canada.\"\n\nLower sales forecast\n\nThe sales of new cars have held up through all of this volatility so far, but most experts predict the tariffs will start taking a toll.\n\nAt the beginning of March there were 2.99 million new vehicles across the United States in inventory, said Mark Schirmer, spokesman for Cox Automotive. That is down slightly from the 3.2 million at the end of November, \"but is a pretty healthy number,\" he said.\n\nIt has to be, because Chevy dealer Stewart said there is no way GM or any automaker could move fast enough to get dealers considerably more vehicles in stock in just a week. With the \"just-in-time production\" system at factories, it would be difficult for automakers get enough parts to the assembly lines to significantly speed up production by April 3, he said.\n\nCharles Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox said now that the tariffs are out, \"I think we will see a stronger finish to March than we had expected (in sales), and prices will begin rising, but not on everything and not all at once. Each dealer and market will approach this differently at first.\"\n\nChesbrough said new car sales in the second quarter will be slower than in the first quarter, and \"if these tariffs stick, the second half of 2025 will see obvious changes in prices and sales pace.\" On Wednesday, Cox lowered its full-year new vehicle sales forecast by 700,000 to 15.6 million due to tariffs disrupting the industry.\n\nOn Thursday, Edmunds.com forecasted that 3.8 million new vehicles will have been sold in the United States in the first quarter, a 1% increase from the year-ago period.\n\n“Inventory levels were healthy for many brands, incentives continued to make a comeback, and there was clear evidence of pent-up demand after the sluggish sales years that followed 2020,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights.\n\nShe said automotive tariffs might have pulled ahead some vehicle purchases, but results were largely driven by the strength of the industry’s underlying fundamentals. The \"road ahead is less certain,\" she said.\n\n“Looking ahead, the newly announced 25% tariffs on imported vehicles add another layer of difficulty for shoppers already facing high prices and interest rates,” said Ivan Drury, Edmunds’ director of insights.\n\n'Customers should act now'\n\nAccording to Edmunds.com the average transaction price for new vehicles in February was $47,373 and the average sticker for new vehicles was $49,350, making the average discount for new vehicles $1,977. The average transaction price for used vehicles was $25,005.\n\n“Shoppers should expect increased competition on dealer lots as news of the tariffs will likely fuel short-term demand from buyers trying to lock in deals before potential price hikes,\" Drury said. \"If you’re planning to buy soon, it’s worth starting your search now. Once tariffs take effect, discounts will be harder to come by and, if spending a bit more today gets you the car you really want, it could save you money in the long run.”\n\nIndeed, Matick Automotive Group Partner Paul Zimmermann told the Free Press he has about a 60-day supply of GM vehicles at Matick Chevrolet in Redford Township and Matick Buick-GMC in Southfield. At his Matick Toyota store in Macomb, he has a 40-day supply. While both are good levels of inventory, Zimmermann said, \"Customers should act now.\"\n\nHe is confident in GM and Toyota leaders to have contingency plans to keep dealers supplied, and the \"customer base will be protected as they navigate through the changes,\" Zimmermann told the Free Press. But he said, \"I now think these (tariffs) will be in place longer than I originally thought. Quantifying amount of content built in the U.S. as well as maybe moving some production back to the U.S. might have to be done in an effort to alleviate the tariffs.\"\n\nJamie L.

And we're going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. But it will be a fair deal.\"\n\nTrump's administration has said that more than 75 nations have sought to make new trade agreements with the U.S. since the president announced his reciprocal tariff plan in early April. At least 15 have submitted proposals, the White House has said.\n\nA Japanese trade delegation met with Trump and members of his administration on April 16. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said South Korea would also be visiting next week and that talks with India are also moving fast.\n\nAs to whether the EU is a priority for the administration, Trump told reporters: \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"\n\nTrump also said he was not worried that U.S. allies were growing closer with China as a result of tariffs and predicted the United States would also make a \"very good\" trade deal with Beijing.\n\n\"Nobody can compete with us. Nobody,\" Trump said in the Cabinet Room.\n\nHe told reporters later in the day, as he signed executive orders, that China had repeatedly reached out to his administration. Trump would not say who in the Chinese government the United States was speaking to and whether he'd spoken to President Xi Jinping directly.\n\n\"It's not that important, because honestly, we're going to have a deal, I believe we're going to have a deal with China. And if we don't, we're going to have a deal anyway, because we're going to set a certain target, and that's going to be it,\" he said.\n\nAt the White House earlier in the day, Meloni said she had confidence that a trade deal could be reached with the EU. \"I'm sure we can make a deal, and I'm here to help with that,\" she said.\n\n\"I cannot deal in the name of the European Union,\" Meloni added. \"My goal would be invite President Trump to pay an official visit to Italy and to understand if there's a possibility when he comes to organize also such a meeting with Europe.\"\n\nMeloni also said that she believes the best way to negotiate is to \"simply speak frankly\" about the needs that each party has and she was at the White House to \"find the best way\" to make them both stronger.\n\n\"We're going to have very little problem making a deal with Europe or anybody else, because we have something that everybody wants,\" Trump responded.\n\nMeloni the first European leader to meet with Trump since he imposed a blanket tariff on most nations. He put a further reciprocal tariff on the EU that is currently paused for 90 days while trade negotiations take place. The EU temporarily halted planned retaliatory tariffs in response.\n\nThe Italian prime minister, who belongs to the conservative Brothers of Italy party, said she considers the U.S. to be a reliable trading partner. She said she was at the White House to \"make the West stronger\" and support Western unity. \"I think simply we have to talk,\" she said. \"And find ourselves in the best middle way to grow together.\n\nShe added: \"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here.\"\n\nThe two leaders continued talks in the Oval Office after their luncheon. They indicated they would be discussing Russia's war against Ukraine and defense spending. Trump has called for every NATO member nation to spend 5% of their GDP on defense.\n\nTrump has yet to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen since taking office. However, the EU's trade chief held talks in Washington with his U.S. counterparts earlier in week. The United States had a substantial trade deficit of $235.6 billion with the bloc in 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It was second only to China, which has a $295.4 billion deficit and Trump hit with 145% tariff hike.\n\nThat amount includes tariffs Trump put on China near the beginning of his term that are in response to illegal fentanyl production.\n\nTrump is not known to have spoken to China's Xi since the trade war began although he suggested to reporters during this executive order signing that he had.

Hicks\n\nContributing Columnist\n\nIt seems likely the U.S. entered recession this month, marking the end of a 4 1/2-year post-pandemic recovery. Policy mistakes caused this downturn — an unforced error of first order. It is possible we’ll see a rapid reversal of these policies, which could avert a deep recession. But enough damage appears to have been done to push us into one.\n\nEconomic data through January was strong. Inflation-adjusted GDP growth in 2024 was a solid 2.8%, only slightly below the 2.9% from 2023. Labor markets in January continued an expansion of 143,000 jobs, cutting the unemployment rate to 4%. This marks the strongest four-year labor market conditions since the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nCapital markets have been unusually robust, with stock exchanges posting their best four years in several decades. The S&P 500 more than doubled in value during this recovery. Physical capital investment boomed. Of course, much of this good news was overshadowed by inflation that hit three-decade highs. But, by January, it had slowed to within a half-point of the Federal Reserve target.\n\nForecasts for the 2025 economy were universally solid. Nearly every major forecast, from the Federal Reserve, commercial firms, trade associations and university economists, had the economy growing by 2.3% to 2.7% this year. My forecast was for 2.5% growth nationally, a happy soft landing.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nTrump is breaking the economy\n\nThen President Trump took office and did exactly what he said he would do. He raised tariffs on China, and now on our two largest trading partners — Canada and Mexico. This would raise an additional tax on U.S. families of more than $1,600 each. By any measure, these tariffs will be the largest tax increase on Americans in history.\n\nBut there’s more to that in this downturn. Trump has also unleashed the Department of Government Efficiency onto the domestic economy.\n\nUltimately, DOGE will not cut spending. Nearly all of its actions violate either Article I of the Constitution, the Impoundment Act or a series of federal civil service laws. So, most of it will be reversed in anticipation of a courtroom embarrassment — like the birthright citizenship order — or lose in court. Most fired federal workers will get back pay and damages. Taxpayers will be the big losers, but it will take years to sort it out.\n\nIn the meantime, tens of thousands of payments to farmers, cancer researchers, FEMA contractors and other public services will be disrupted. The effects will be everywhere — only 6% of federal employees live in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.\n\nIronically, the densest federal workforce nationwide is in Martin County, Indiana, where more than half of all workers are federal civilian employees. A whopping 79.3% of their votes went to Trump last November.\n\nStill, the DOGE impacts are weeks or months away from having any macroeconomic effect.\n\nUncertainty, chaos destroy confidence\n\nThe House passed a budget last week by one vote. The content of the bill isn’t especially important to current economic conditions. But the immediate impact of this bill passing by such a narrow margin is a good signal that the government is aimed for a mid-March shutdown.\n\nThe problem isn’t that Trump administration policies have already hit the economy. The problem is that unhinged wackiness is the Trump governing strategy. That realization has exploded economic uncertainty. The best measure shows economic uncertainty at its highest point in history — worse than the week of 9/11, the Great Recession or COVID-19.\n\nConsequently, nearly every measure of economic health has plummeted in the past few weeks. A survey of the carnage is stunning.\n\nConsumption is in steep decline. Measures of consumer confidence by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board have both taken deep downturns, while the Federal Personal Consumption Expenditure data dipped sharply last month.\n\nHousehold investment growth has stopped, with housing sales and prices reversing across markets in much of the country. Stock indices — a measure of business growth expectations — have experienced declines since Trump took office.\n\nGovernment spending is still rising\n\nGovernment spending is not part of the decline. In fact, federal government spending has risen substantially in the first two months of 2025. That is unsurprising, since 76% of it is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt service. So, this downturn is not precipitated by actual spending cuts — because there aren’t any.\n\nU.S. exports are poised to shrink for two policy-related reasons. The first is appreciating dollars — a negative consequence of trade war rhetoric, which makes our exports pricier. The second is trade retaliation and a growing boycott of U.S. products. This is poised to grow exponentially, clobbering agriculture, automobiles and many key brands.\n\nCanada, Mexico and China have far better economists than Trump has hired. They know our pain points and will surgically target retaliatory tariffs.\n\nThe yield curve on bonds has inverted. That means bond buyers expect long-term interest rates to decline relative to short-run rates. That is because the U.S. is entering a recession and may have to cut rates. I think a period of stagflation will happen first, persisting for many months.\n\nWorse still, the Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model, which had U.S. growth at over 2.7% in the first week of the Trump administration, has turned negative. Its current prediction is that first quarter U.S. GDP will decline by 2.8%. If you omit government spending from the Fed’s equation, the GDP drop is 3.8%.\n\nThe yield curve and GDPNow models are imperfect, but they’ve been 100% accurate when both predict a recession. Both now say a recession has started.\n\nThe downturn is a policy choice by Trump. He could reverse any policy on a dime to prevent a deep downturn. In fact, many on Wall Street believe he will, which has prevented a stock market route. I do not. He is doing precisely what he said he’d do, and no American should be surprised.\n\nStill, I’m old fashioned. Elections matter, and good economic policy should be rewarded by good economic outcomes. Bad policy by bad outcomes. That is how we learn, or in this case, re-learn our lesson.\n\nMichael J.

For the latest news on tariffs, view our story for Tuesday, April 1.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pressed his case for global tariffs Monday by posting a list on social media of U.S. companies considering major domestic expansion plans, hours after threatening Russia and Iran with \"secondary\" tariffs and suggesting levies will help the U.S. auto industry \"make a lot of money.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he will announce details Wednesday for his tariffs aimed at curtailing the flow of foreign goods into the U.S. Economists warn that tariffs will drive up prices for Americans, but Trump has focused on the hundreds billions of dollars in new investment projects companies are planning to avoid the import taxes.\n\nTrump said his tariffs won't just target nations that contribute most to the U.S. trade deficit.\n\n“You’d start with all countries,” Trump told reporters Sunday night aboard Air Force One. “There’s not a cutoff.”\n\nTrump’s remarks provided clarification on the scope of the tariffs after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S. would be most impacted by the tariffs. Bessent has called these the “Dirty 15” countries.\n\nAmid growing economic anxieties at home and abroad, Trump last week softened his tone on the tariffs, saying they will be “more lenient” than some nations are expecting. Yet he made clear Sunday the tariff rates will be significant.\n\n“It will be substantial money for their countries,” Trump said.\n\nTrump on Putin: Trump angered after Putin criticized Zelenskyy's credibility\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Gold prices reached a record high of $3,128.06 per ounce Monday as the impending Trump tariffs prompted investors to seek the safety of the precious metal. The cost of gold has risen by 18% this year.\n\n∎ The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal government employees, filed a lawsuit Monday attempting to keep Trump from stripping hundreds of thousands of federal workers of the ability to collectively bargain with agencies through their unions.\n\nWhite House on tariffs: 'It's time for reciprocity'\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to say how many countries would face tariffs in Trump’s announcement Wednesday but said they would offset unfair treatment the U.S. has faced for decades.\n\nShe cited a 700% tariff in Japan on U.S. rice, a 100% tariff in India on U.S. agricultural products and a nearly 300% tariff in Canada on U.S. butter and cheese. India has offered to reduce its tariffs to appease Trump.\n\n“It has put a lot of Americans out of business and out of work over the past several decades,” Leavitt said. “It’s time for reciprocity.”\n\nShe said Trump is not concerned with the stock-market selloff ahead of the tariff announcement.\n\n“The president has always said the stock market is a snapshot of a moment in time and he’s doing what’s best for Main Street,” Leavitt said. “Wall Street will work out just fine in this administration, just like they did in the first one.”\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nUncertainty rattles European stock market\n\nInvestors wary of the anticipated Trump tariffs drove European shares down to their lowest close in two months Monday amid growing concerns of a global economic slowdown.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX fell 1.5%, extending losses to a fourth consecutive session and logging its biggest daily decline in nearly three weeks. Meantime, the region's volatility index reached a near three-week high.\n\nJason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said the market uncertainty brought by the tariff threat is not going away soon.\n\n\"Uncertainty and market volatility are likely to stay high in the near term as investors recalibrate their outlooks after these events,\" Draho said, referring to Wednesday's tariffs announcement and the release of U.S. payrolls data later in the week.\n\nCar insurance to cost about $200 more a year\n\nIn addition to the extra cost of buying a car expected from the Trump tariffs, a requirement for driving a vehicle also figures to get more expensive.\n\nThe average full-cover auto insurance policy may cost about 8% more − or close to $200 − by the end of the year, according to an analysis by Insurify. The actual number will probably be higher because the analysis was done before Trump imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel and announced the updated auto tariffs.\n\n\"It might not be intuitive to people that the tariffs would end up raising people's car insurance rates, and the main way they do that is because tariffs would increase the price of car parts,\" said Matt Brannon, an Insurify data journalist who completed the analysis. \"The cost of car insurance is based in part on the cost of car parts.\"\n\n− Betty Lin-Fisher\n\nWhat is an American car?\n\nTrump said he wants to spur more manufacturing in the United States with his new tariff targeting foreign car imports, but defining an American-made car isn’t easy. Online automotive marketplace Cars.com found just over half of new inventory vehicles saw final assembly in the U.S. About 19% were assembled in Mexico, 4.2% in Canada and 1.4% in China, as previously reported by USA TODAY.\n\n\"No cars are actually 100% made in the United States, with parts sourced from the United States,” Edmunds consumer insights analyst Joseph Yoon said. “It’s going to be a big, big deal for the auto industry, globally, if the tariffs are implemented and enforced at face value.” Read more here.\n\n− Bailey Schulz\n\nA car that's truly 'made in America': Good luck finding one.\n\nChina, Japan, South Korea to jointly respond to tariffs\n\nChina, Japan and South Korea agreed to jointly respond to U.S. tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Monday. The comments came as trade ministers for the three countries discussed economics Sunday for the first time in five years to brace for Trump’s tariffs.\n\nJapan and South Korea are seeking to import semiconductor raw materials from China, and China is also interested in purchasing chip products from Japan and South Korea, according to the post on Weibo by Yuyuan Tantian, who is affiliated with CCTV.\n\nAll three countries are major U.S. trading partners.\n\n'This is not going to succeed at reviving U.S. manufacturing'\n\nMany trade experts and economists say it’s unlikely a significant share of firms with overseas factories will move established supply chains halfway around the world under the threat of on-again, off-again tariffs whose duration is uncertain in a tumultuous economic climate. Those that do would have to grapple with severe shortages of skilled workers.\n\nTrump’s tariffs during his first term led to more job losses in industries forced to pay the higher duties than gained in sectors protected by the import fees, studies show.\n\n“This is not going to succeed at reviving U.S. manufacturing,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Read more here.\n\n− Paul Davidson\n\nTariffs do have supporters\n\nShawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers union, endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. But he was bullish on Trump's tariffs in an interview Sunday on CBS News' Face the Nation. Fain says 90,000 U.S. automitive jobs and 65 factories have vanished amid \"unfair trade laws\" dating back more than 30 years. U.S. plants have excess capacity and \"could bring work back in very short order,\" Fain said.\n\n\"Tariffs aren't the total solution,\" Fain said. \"Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here. ... American, working-class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"\n\nE.J. Antoni, a public finance economist and senior fellow at the conservative Committee to Unleash Prosperity, says claims that tariffs will fuel rampant inflation \"do not align with the facts.\"\n\n\"Both economic theory and economic history show tariffs are always at least partly paid for by exporters, not just customers,\" Antoni wrote in his opinion piece for Fox News earlier this month. \"That is why other nations love imposing heavy tariffs on American industry. It is a way to force U.S. exporters into subsidizing the world.\"\n\nWill tariffs help the economy? Trump say tariffs will be worth the pain. Experts disagree.\n\nPoland PM urges Trump to reconsider tariffs\n\nPoland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, on Monday urged Trump to reconsider sweeping tariffs that Trump has said will include duties on imports from all U.S. trading partners.\n\n“Think about it, Mr. President and dear American friends, before you decide to impose tariffs against your closest allies,” Tusk said in a video posted on X. “Cooperation is always better than confrontation.”\n\nTusk touted Poland’s partnership with the U.S., saying he just finished signing the latest agreement between the two countries regarding defense cooperation.\n\n“You have only friends here, and I can say the same thing about Europe as a whole,\" Tusk said. \"You have friends and trusted allies from Portugal to Poland, from Denmark to Greece.”\n\nTrump lists investment plans on Truth Social\n\nThe investment plans on the list Trump posted on Truth Social include Cincinnati-based GE Aerospace. The company announced earlier this month it plans to invest nearly $1 billion in its U.S. factories and supply chain and said it will hire around 5,000 U.S. workers this year.\n\nGlobal firms on the list included the Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank Group, which has announced plans to invest at least $500 billion to build artificial intelligence-equipped factories in the United States.\n\nUS automakers bracing for tariffs\n\nLeadership at General Motors and Ford Motor Co. are reassuring employees and investors that the companies are working on how to best navigate the turbulence they foresee coming out of the 25% tariffs Trump imposed on all imported vehicles and most auto parts. The messages to the workforces at both automakers, obtained by the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said companies are well-positioned to address the uncertainty around the tariffs.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley noted in a memo Thursday that nearly 80% of the vehicles Ford sells in America are made in the U.S., but \"this does not mean Ford is immune to the impact of tariffs, which could be meaningful.\"\n\nTrump, in an interview with NBC on Saturday, said he “couldn’t care less” if automakers raised prices because of tariffs. NBC said that, after the interview, a presidential aide said Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.\n\n“The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money,\" Trump said.\n\n− Jamie L. LaReau, Detroit Free Press\n\nTrump angered by Putin's plan for Ukraine\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin suggested Friday that Ukraine could be placed under a form of temporary administration to allow for new elections and the signature of key accords, which could effectively push out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump said Sunday that if he and Putin are unable to make a deal to end the war \"and if I think it was Russia’s fault ... I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia.\"\n\nTrump told NBC News he was \"pissed off\" when Putin criticized the credibility of Zelenskyy's leadership. Trump said he planned to speak with Putin this week. Trump said the additional secondary tariffs of 25% to 50% on all Russian oil could come within a few weeks.\n\nThe result would be that, \"If you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States,” Trump said. “There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.”\n\nTrump said he still has “a very good relationship\" with Putin and that his “anger dissipates quickly ... if he (Putin) does the right thing.”\n\nTrump threatens tariffs on Iran over nuclear deal\n\nTrump, while serving his first time from 2017-2021, withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran's disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions. Since then the Islamic Republic has surpassed the agreed limits in its uranium-enrichment program.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump threatened Iran with secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.\n\n\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC. \"But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.\"\n\nTehran dismissed Trump's warning.

Some speculated that these countries could be close to deals. European Commissioner Olof Gill said earlier the EU still aimed for a deal by the July 9 deadline.\n\nConsumers also have been feeling better about inflation. The New York Federal Reserve's consumer survey showed respondents expect inflation a year from now at 3%, the same as in January before Trump's initial April tariff announcement and down from the peak of 3.6% in March and April.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nTesla chief executive Elon Musk said his new America Party will support bitcoin.\n\nSeparately, Nasdaq-listed real estate firm Murano said it bought 21 bitcoin recently as it begins to accumulate the digital currency.

It is where three tectonic plates meet and the Northwest’s Cascadia subduction zone and California’s San Andreas Fault system meet. The quake itself occurred on the Mendocino fault zone.\n\nIn Arcata, California, just under 60 miles from Petrolia, 25-year-old Jared Mitchell was having an early lunch in his apartment when he felt a \"jolt,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n“It wasn’t that big of a violent shake,” said Mitchell, an assistant manager at Los Bagels, a bagel shop in town. “But my apartment was swaying back and forth for a bit. It was kind of scary, like I was on a raft in the middle of the sea.”\n\nBy 12:30 p.m., less than two hours after the initial quake, the area had experienced 13 different aftershocks, ranging from 5.1 to 3.1, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. By 2:30 p.m., the USGS had reported at least 39 aftershocks of at least a 2.5 magnitude in the region, including Petrolia and Ferndale.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center canceled its warning at 11:54 a.m. local time and said no tsunami observations were available to report. \"No destructive tsunami has been recorded,\" the center said. However, it advised the public not to reoccupy hazard zones until local emergency officials indicate it is safe to do so.\n\nHow many people felt the earthquake?\n\nUSGS initially estimated more than 150,000 people might have been exposed to earthquake shaking, between just north of Fort Bragg to Eureka. One USA TODAY reporter in San Francisco did not feel its impacts, but another resident right on the San Francisco Bay said it was the longest earthquake she'd ever felt.\n\nTraci Grant, 53, a public relations specialist, said she was on the phone with a friend when she felt her San Francisco apartment of 20 years “swaying.\"\n\n“I felt my whole apartment was moving in slow motion,” said Grant, adding that the older building she lives in the Marina District is retrofitted. “For a moment I thought I should get my purse and my cat and get out.”\n\nGrant said she felt it for nearly 30 seconds, “which was long enough to me.” She said nothing fell down in her apartment.\n\n“It just kept going and going,” Grant said. “It was scary and a bit exciting at the same time. ... It was more of a roll than just shake, shake, shake.”\n\nSee where the epicenter was\n\nEarthquake rocks in complex area where 3 tectonic plates meet\n\nThe Earth’s crust is made up of many tectonic plates that move slowly over the Earth's surface. Thursday’s earthquake hit in an area that’s extremely complex, seismically speaking, said Stephen DeLong, a supervisory research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nIt’s near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a tectonic boundary where three plates meet: the Pacific, North American and Juan de Fuca. The Triple Junction is also the point that the Northwest’s northern Cascadia subduction zone and the southern San Andreas Fault system meet.\n\nThursday’s earthquakes are occurring in the Mendocino fracture zone, said Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.\n\nLarge earthquakes also occurred near the junction in northern California in previous Decembers, according to the geological survey. There were two, a 6.1 and 6.0, near Petrolia in 2021 and a 6.4 near Ferndale in 2022.\n\nMore aftershocks expected\n\nThe USGS released an aftershock forecast on Thursday.\n\nThere is a greater than 99% probability of one or more magnitude 3.0 earthquakes in the area over the next day, a 74% chance of a magnitude 4.0 or larger, 22% chance of a magnitude 5.0 and larger and a 3% chance of magnitude 6.0 or larger.\n\nApproximately 10,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers in Humboldt county were initially without electric power on Thursday as the utility assessed its gas and electric systems. By 3:30 p.m. that number had been reduced to 500 customers as inspections were conducted. “No damage to PG&E critical facilities, gas system or generating assets has been reported,” said spokesperson Megan McFarland.\n\nHow common is a Bay Area tsunami warning?\n\nBetween 1850 and 2004, 51 credible tsunamis were recorded in San Francisco Bay, according to 2004 research led by Lori Dengler, a professor emeritus at Cal Poly Humboldt. Only two of those generated damage, the 1960 Chile earthquake and the 1964 Alaska earthquake, which generated waves of almost 4 feet at the Presidio, the authors reported.\n\nPrevious tsunami warning canceled\n\nPreviously, a tsunami warning advised a tsunami could arrive along the coast starting near Fort Bragg at 11:10 a.m. local time and move along the coast in northern California and southern Oregon, arriving in San Francisco at 12:10. Residents within the zone – stretching from Davenport, California, northwest of Santa Cruz, to the Douglas Lane county line in Oregon – were urged to move off the water and beach and evacuate inland beyond tsunami hazard zones.\n\n\"Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets,\" the tsunami warning center advised. \"Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.\"\n\nJust how big is a 7.0 quake?\n\nMagnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. Officially it's called the moment magnitude scale. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each number is 10 times as strong as the one before it. So a 5.0 earthquake is ten times stronger than a 4.0.\n\nThe magnitude and effect of an earthquake, according to Michigan Technological University:\n\nBelow 2.5: Generally not felt.\n\n2.5 to 5.4: Minor or no damage.\n\n5.5 to 6.0: Slight damage to buildings.\n\n6.1 to 6.9: Serious damage.\n\n7.0 to 7.9: Major earthquake. Serious damage.\n\n8.0 or greater: Massive damage, can destroy communities.\n\nPreliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey indicates a 32% chance of estimated economic losses of $1 million-$10 million, and a 32% chance of economic losses of $10 million-$100 million, with the chances of losses greater than that estimated at 15%.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/01/13/japan-hit-earthquake-magnitude-kyushu/77666760007/", "title": "Japan hit with 6.9 magnitude earthquake", "text": "A strong earthquake rattled southern Japan on Monday, the United States Geological Survey is reporting.\n\nThe notable quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 6.9, the USGS said and was recorded at sea about seven miles southeast of the city of Miyazaki.\n\nLocated on the island of Kyushu, Miyazaki is about 700 miles southeast of Tokyo. Per its last census, the city has a population of about 400,00 people.\n\nThe quake happened at 9:19 p.m. local time, data from the agency shows.\n\nIt was not immediately known if anyone was injured or whether any structures on land had been damaged.\n\nTsunami advisories in place\n\nData provided by USGS showed the earthquake was just over 22 miles deep.\n\nTsunami advisories for waves up to about 3.5 feet were issued for the southern prefectures of Miyazaki and Kochi, online data also shows.\n\nA 20-centimeter tsunami was later recorded reaching Miyazaki city, public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nThere were no issues reported at the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant in western Japan or the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, the outlet reported.

Among the dead were at least 18 people killed at the Mount Everest base camp when it was hit by an avalanche.\n\nOn Tuesday, tremors were felt in Kathmandu, some 400 km (250 miles) from the epicentre, and residents in the city ran out of their houses.\n\n\"The bed was shaking and I thought my child was moving the bed...I didn't pay that much attention but the shaking of (a) window made me understand that it's an earthquake,\" said Kathmandu resident Meera Adhikarii. \"I'm still shaking out of fear and am in shock.\"\n\nOne person was injured in Kathmandu when he jumped off the top of a house after feeling the strong tremors, Nepal Police spokesman Bishwa Adhikari said.\n\nThe quake also jolted Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal.\n\nTibet is prone to earthquakes\n\nTibet was struck with a magnitude 6.8 earthquake on Tuesday, one of the most powerful tremors in recent years, that hit the northern foothills of the Himalayas, killing at least 95 people.\n\nTibet is a seismically active zone. It logged more than 100 earthquakes of magnitude of at least 3.0 last year. But quakes of magnitude 7.0 and above are rare, with just nine since the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe epicentre was located in Tingri, a rural county near the boundary where the Indian tectonic plate collides with the Eurasian plate, creating long fault-lines across the Tibetan plateau.\n\nBelow are some notable quakes in Tibet in recent decades:\n\nJUNE 1, 2024\n\nMagnitude: 5.9\n\nEpicenter: Nagqu, northern Tibet\n\nTibet's biggest earthquake in 2024, but no reports of casualties or property losses due to its isolated location.\n\nNOV. 18, 2017\n\nMagnitude: 6.9\n\nEpicenter: Mainling, eastern Tibet\n\nThe largest earthquake in the Lhasa block since 1950.

It was felt across Humboldt County. The quake struck on the San Andreas fault, which runs along the coast line.\n\nIn Oregon, areas impacted for the tsunami warning appeared to stretch from the southern Oregon Coast north toward Florence. The tsunami warning was canceled around noon, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nA tsunami warning at 10:49 a.m. advised a tsunami could arrive along the coast starting near Fort Bragg at 11:10 a.m. and move along the coast in northern California and southern Oregon, arriving in San Francisco at 12:10 p.m. Residents within the zone — stretching from Davenport, California, northwest of Santa Cruz, to the Douglas and Lane county line in Oregon — were urged to move off the water and beach and evacuate inland beyond tsunami hazard zones.\n\n\"Move out of the water, off the beach, and away from harbors, marinas, breakwaters, bays and inlets,\" the National Tsunami Warning Center advised. \"Repeated coastal flooding is possible as waves arrive onshore, move inland, and drain back into the ocean.\"\n\nThe tsunami warning included areas around San Francisco Bay.\n\nIn Oregon, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department had closed state park beach accesses on the coast but were set to reopen at 3 p.m.\n\nInitial U.S. Geological Survey estimates suggested more than 150,000 people might have been exposed to the earthquake.\n\nMagnitude is a measurement of the strength of an earthquake. Officially it's called the moment magnitude scale. It's a logarithmic scale, meaning each number is 10 times as strong as the one before it.

Another crane will be brought in to dismantle and remove the beam.\n\nThe tower of the other crane flipped top-first off the building on the opposite side and embedded into nearby North Rampart Street, where it could be seen sticking straight up.

Crews were to begin clearing some of the new debris so rescuers could start making their way into parts of the underground garage that is of particular interest. Once there, rescuers are hoping that they will gain access for the first time to parts of the garage area that are a focus of interest, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah has said. That could give a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble and could possibly harbor survivors.\n\nDemolition crews drilling holes for the explosives had completed their work as of Sunday evening, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Sunday evening news conference.\n\nShe announced a shelter in place zone for surrounding residents from 7 p.m. Sunday until \"two hours following the demolition.\" No building evacuations have been recommended, she added.\n\nIt will be safe to resume search and rescue activities shortly after the blast, no matter what time of night, she said.\n\nThe demolition was conducted using a technique called \"energetic felling,\" which consists of \"small strategically placed detonations and relies on force of gravity to bring the building down,\" Levine Cava said.\n\nResidents in the area immediately around the condo building were warned to stay inside during the demolition and close openings to their homes because of the potential for dust. A cover has also been laid atop the debris field that is closest to the damaged building, she said.\n\nIn implosions – using explosives to have a building fall in on itself – the charges are generally set off in rapid succession over a matter of seconds, said Scott Homrich, who heads the National Demolition Association and runs his own demolition company in Detroit, Michigan. Setting the explosives off at intervals serves to break up the building at the same time it’s coming down.\n\nOfficials acknowledged that the tragedy is continuing to unfold during the July 4th holiday.\n\n“This July 4 we’re reminded that patriotism isn’t just about loyalty to country,” said Levine Cava. “It’s about loyalty to one another – to our communities, to those in need whose names or stories we may not know ever, but to whom we are connected by compassion and by resilience.”\n\nLevine Cava said Saturday that the National Science Foundation was on scene using lidar – a laser-based system that can scan environments and buildings to create a digital map – and drones to create a 3D-model of the structure to assist engineers in demolition preparation.\n\nControlled Demolition Inc. has been contracted to perform the demolition, Levine Cava said.\n\nThe Maryland-based company is more than 70 years old, according to its website. The company has been involved in several high-profile demolitions, including the Plaza Tower in Atlantic City, New Jersey; the One James River Plaza in Richmond, Virginia; the Seattle Kingdome stadium; the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City; and the remains of the World Trade Center in New York.\n\nOn Sunday, Levine Cava noted the significance of the work on the site continuing on the Fourth of July holiday. \"This is not an Independence Day like any we have ever experienced before,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a third Miami-area condo building was evacuated late Saturday after an inspector found issues with flooring in a vacant unit and exterior wall damage to the low-rise unit, the Miami Herald reported. Another building had been evacuated Friday evening over structural concerns.\n\nOfficial: Tropical Storm Elsa arrival a 'blessing in disguise' for demolition\n\nSurfside Mayor Charles Burkett labeled Tropical Storm Elsa’s trek toward the Florida peninsula “a blessing in disguise” because it accelerated the demolition plan, which was initially forecast to take weeks.\n\n“It’s eliminated a looming threat, a dangerous threat for our rescue workers,” he said Sunday evening.\n\nBurkett said the building demolition will potentially open up about one-third of the rubble pile to new access by search-and-rescue teams who are looking for survivors. He added that emergency officials can control the direction the structure falls to the ground, rather than Elsa’s gusts.\n\n“I’m starting to see this approaching storm as a lucky situation, because it forced us into a conversation which has accomplished a lot of good things,” Burkett said.\n\nElsa is forecast to approach the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. Although Surfside is on Florida's east coast, the area \"could see some gusts,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday. Local impacts from the storm could begin as soon as Monday afternoon, he said. \"We're prepared to deal with impacts.\"\n\nLevine Cava said the impacts of Elsa could slow rescue efforts in the coming days depending on conditions in Surfside.\n\nSurfside official pushes back on claim town delayed repairs\n\nA Surfside official on Sunday issued a statement pushing back against the idea the town had slowed the condo's plans to make needed structural repairs.\n\nTown manager Andrew Hyatt said the repairs discussed in emails first reported by the Miami Herald, which detailed Surfside's more than a month delay in responding to the condo association, were preliminary plans unrelated to structural work and not permits to begin repairs the building needed to pass a 40-year recertification.\n\nThe Herald reported a condo building manager grew impatient in emails to the town around temporary parking as the building sought to repair a concrete slab under the pool and damaged columns in the condo's garage.\n\n“It would appear that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association sought to address a number of issues outside the scope of any proposed 40-year recertification work,\" such as new natural gas lines and added parking, Hyatt's statement said. \"There was no indication during any communications between the Town and the association by telephone or electronic mail that this submission required emergency action by the Town of Surfside.\"\n\nIn a June 21 email, more than a month after the first request to the town, building manager Scott Stewart wrote, “As we are out to bid on our project (we) need to get to answers to these questions. … This is holding us up and cost (sic) are going up and out (sic) 40 year is coming up fast.\"\n\nThe town responded with requests for additional information on June 23, hours before the building's partial collapse.\n\nEven without the town delay, it is not certain whether it would have made a difference. Approving bids and permits for such work may have taken longer than a month. And while the structural problems that were to be repaired have gotten intense scrutiny, it has not been determined definitively that they caused the collapse.\n\nTwo more bodies pulled from rubble\n\nMiami-Dade Police said Saturday evening that two additional people were found dead in the collapsed section of the building, bringing the official death toll to 24. The June 24 building collapse has left 121 people still unaccounted for.\n\nPolice said Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and Gonzalo Torre, 81, were recovered Friday.\n\nWPLG reported Cattarossi was an independent photographer and lived in the building with her 7-year-old daughter, who was also killed in the collapse, according to the TV station.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/27/protest-prisons-skeleton-board-monarch-slump-news-around-states/41072781/", "title": "Protest for prisons, skeleton on board: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a Confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state Supreme Court.

House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in a statement that Alaskans “deserve to know where their elected officials stand.” House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in response, said the vote “was about nothing more than creating material to use against other members in the next election cycle.” Lawmakers attempted to override a $5 million veto of funds for the ferry system and vetoes of funds for school debt reimbursement to municipalities and a construction fund for rural schools. The issues were considered as part of one vote.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 62-year-old man was cited last week after trying to disguise a fake skeleton as a passenger just to use the HOV lane. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says a trooper pulled over the man Thursday after noticing he had placed a fake skeleton in the passenger’s front seat. The skeleton was sitting upright, wearing a hat and tied to the front seat. Department spokesman Raul Garcia said troopers cite about 7,000 HOV lane violators every year. Last April, a man was pulled over after driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin wearing a sweatshirt, baseball cap and sunglasses.\n\nArkansas\n\nSalem: Thieves have stolen the old school bell that hung at the top of the steps at the historic Old Main schoolhouse. Friends of Old Main Board of Directors member Ron Plumlee recently discovered the bell was missing while checking on maintenance at the old schoolhouse. The bolts holding the bell in place were apparently sawed off, Plumlee said. The theft is suspected to have required at least two people because of the bell’s size and weight, he said. The bell has been at the top of the steps for at least 70 years. The school was built in 1930 and is now operated by Friends of Old Main as a nonprofit activity center. The bell was brass with an inscription around the top and has many marks from ringing over the years. Anyone with information that might lead to the recovery of the bell or the apprehension of those responsible is asked to contact the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office at (870) 895-2601.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state’s coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That’s not much different from last year’s tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A research center at Colorado State University dedicated to studying the chemical compounds in hemp is expected to open this spring, school officials said Thursday. The announcement comes after the university received a $1.5 million donation from a Golden-based company that makes products out of CBD, a popular cannabis compound with unproven health claims. The money would be used to fund research, cover operating costs and purchase equipment, university officials said. The facility would allow faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to study the formulation of cannabinoids, separation efficiencies, efficacy testing and more, The Denver Post reports. Researchers at the facility would work in partnership with Panacea Life Sciences, a company founded by university alumna Leslie Buttorff that manufactures CBD products for people and pets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The state Department of Motor Vehicles will soon allow a nonbinary gender designation on driver’s licenses. Starting Monday, three gender options will be available for state-issued license and identification cards – male, female and nonbinary, denoted by the letter X, according to the New Haven Register. “We want to be sure that we’re fair for everyone, to respect people’s gender identity,” Deputy Commissioner Tony Guerrera said. Connecticut will be one of 12 states that allow nonbinary gender identification on driver’s licenses, he said. The move was one of the department’s top priorities when Guerrera and Commissioner Sibongile Magubane were appointed, he said. State Sen. Matt Lesser said Saturday that it would be important for people who identify as nonbinary and revenue-neutral for everyone else.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The public needs to keep a safe distance from the seals that will be present along beaches and other waterways through April, according to the state’s official marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. The MERR Institute recommends the public stay at least 150 feet from seals and always keep pets on a leash and at a safe distance because seals are wild animals that can bite if they feel threatened. It is common at this time of the year to see seals on area beaches, docks and other locations where they can rest, the Delaware State News reports. Four species of seals may visit Delaware. Oftentimes these animals are healthy, but at other times they may be suffering from illness or injury and in need of veterinary care, officials said. Anyone who encounters a seal is asked to contact MERR as soon as possible at (302) 228-5029. More information can be found on MERR’s website.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The public is invited to the coronation ceremony for the newly crowned Miss Black D.C. USA this Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The pageant’s new titleholder, Amini Bonane, is a Harvard graduate student who says one of the reasons she competed for the crown was to expand her platform on mentoring and efforts to find missing women of color. She has a campaign called Find My Sister that’s dedicated to raising awareness. Her coronation ceremony will be coupled with a charity fundraiser for the cause. According to Black and Missing in America Inc., nearly 40% of missing people are persons of color. Bonane’s coronation ceremony and charity fundraiser will be held Saturday from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other D.C. government officials and professionals are expected to attend the evening of networking, performances and philanthropy.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Eighty Burmese pythons were caught during a 10-day pre-Super Bowl hunt, designed to raise awareness about the invasive species decimating the Everglades. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 80 pythons were caught during the competition. Pro grand prize winner Mike Kimmel won an ATV for capturing eight pythons, and rookie grand prize winner Kristian Hernandez removed six pythons and also won an ATV. Pro grand prize winner Tom Rahill won $2,000 for bagging a 62-pound python. Several other cash prizes were also awarded. The game’s organizing committee worked with Florida to promote the Python Bowl. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. Wildlife officials estimate the population may exceed 100,000. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Hundreds of people have shown their support for an armless street artist whose artwork, supplies and donation box were stolen near the University of Georgia. Nearly $42,000 had been raised online as of late Sunday for Michael Davenport, who is known in Athens for sketching the university’s bulldog mascot. He holds a pen in his mouth to create his art because he lost his arms as a child. Davenport, 53, said his belongings were stolen Jan. 15 when he took a break to use the restroom at a nearby business. Athens-Clarke police said detectives were looking to identify the suspect, seen on surveillance video in what appears to be a gold-colored minivan. Stephen Frazier, the general manager at Budget Host Inn in Athens, said he set up the online fundraising account in Davenport’s name. Davenport told WAGA-TV he plans to use the money for a truck to carry his supplies and for medical treatment for his leg, injured in an attack last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Medical Examiner’s Office has identified the remains of two people found in a burnt-out home where a man allegedly shot and killed two Honolulu police officers and attacked a neighbor before setting the house ablaze last weekend. Officials on Friday released a statement identifying the homeowner, Lois Ann Cain, 77, as one of the two people found in the house that was destroyed by fire in an upscale neighborhood near Waikiki Beach. A tenant, Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel, is accused of shooting police who were responding to the home after he allegedly attacked and stabbed a woman who also lived in the house. Cain was in the process of evicting Hanel when the violence erupted Sunday. The medical examiner also identified the second set of remains but withheld a name pending notification of next of kin.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of residents who have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage has passed 60,000. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare posted updated numbers Thursday. The agency estimates 91,000 residents meet requirements. Coverage started Jan. 1, but enrollment is year-round. Those who sign up for Medicaid will be covered for doctor visits that occurred earlier in the same month. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers. But legislators in 2019 added restrictions requiring five waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers are required when states want to deviate from Medicaid rules. Federal officials have yet to approve any of Idaho’s requested waivers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Marijuana was stolen last week from a box placed at Chicago’s Midway International Airport for travelers who dispose of their marijuana before they board a plane, police said Friday. The “marijuana amnesty boxes” were placed at Midway and O’Hare International Airport after it became legal this year to possess marijuana in Illinois. The boxes, owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police, were installed so air travelers can be in compliance with federal law as well as the local laws at their destination. Police officers regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana. “Tampering with them, or attempting to remove anything placed inside, is a crime,” said Chicago police spokesman Antony Gugliemi, who added that an investigation is underway.\n\nIndiana\n\nTaswell: The state’s newest nature preserve features dramatic limestone outcrops and a cave inhabited by rare animals adapted to life in total darkness. The Natural Resources Commission recently approved the creation of the Patoka Hills Nature Preserve, which spans nearly 27 acres in southern Indiana’s Crawford County. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources said the new preserve contains one of Indiana’s finest paleontological sites in a small cave that the agency calls “highly significant.” Staff from the Indiana State Museum have been excavating inside that cave since 1987, and their discoveries have shed light on Indiana’s past climate, plants and animals during the latter part of the last ice age. The DNR said the cave is also home to a springtail insect and a cave millipede, both of which lack eyes and pigmentation and are rare worldwide.\n\nIowa\n\nCouncil Bluffs: Leaders in western Iowa say lingering floodwaters and damage from last year’s Missouri River flooding have led them to again cancel Loessfest. The Council Bluffs City Council said Friday in a news release that restoration work on Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park, which connects to neighboring Omaha, Nebraska, via the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, can’t begin until after the spring thaw. There isn’t enough time between the thaw and the Memorial Day weekend event to get the work done, the council said. Loessfest was established in 2013 and has become the community’s traditional kick-off to summer. Last year, Loessfest was initially postponed to Labor Day weekend, then canceled altogether due to ongoing flooding. Other locations were considered before canceling this year’s festival, officials said. But it was ultimately decided that a critical component of Loessfest was its easy proximity to Omaha.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Local police are looking into using genetic genealogy databases to help solve cold murder and rape cases. Capt. Jeff Weible said the department isn’t ready to decide whether it will use the technique, which has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. while also raising legal and privacy concerns. But to help find out how the technique could be used, the department co-hosted a two-day training conference on it last week. The Wichita Eagle reports it drew more than 60 people from law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the state and nation to downtown Wichita. The conference’s co-host, Gene by Gene, is allowing law enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples and lab data files from certain kinds of cold cases. Gene by Gene then queries its DNA database, Family Tree DNA, for any matches that investigators can use to track down suspects or identify remains.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State colleges and universities will ask for their first funding increase since the 2007-08 budget, lawmakers have been told. Aaron Thompson, president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, said public colleges will seek a 6.2% increase next fiscal year and an 8.8% increase in the 2022 fiscal year over current base funding levels. Thompson said he is not sure whether the budget Gov. Andy Beshear presents to the General Assembly on Tuesday will include the request but is optimistic. Kentucky has cut higher education funding in each two-year budget since 2008, leaving colleges and universities to increase tuition rates. Thompson told legislators that after more than a decade of higher education cuts, “we are down to the point where we are cutting into the bone.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dozens of protesters marched from the site of the partially collapsed Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter to City Hall on Friday, demanding that something be done about the hotel and that the two bodies still inside be recovered. The Hard Rock Hotel was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12, sending plumes of dust into the air, killing three people and injuring dozens. The bodies of two of the three workers who died are still inside what is left of the building, which city officials have decided to take down through implosion in March. People in the city were outraged last week when a tarp at the site shifted, exposing the remains of one of the workers who died. The tarp has since been replaced, but it sparked cries for greater accountability. City Council member Jason Williams addressed the crowd, specifically questioning why a worker who had been in the building when it collapsed was later deported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine home sales surged at the end of 2019, which was a record-breaking year for real estate in the state. The Pine Tree State set records for sales volume and median sales price, the Portland Press Herald reports. Home buyers finished strong at the end of the year, as December sales increased 23% compared with the same month the previous year. Total sales for 2019 reached 18,140 homes, which was a 1.5% increase from the previous year, according to the Maine Association of Realtors. The median sales price increase 4.7% from the previous record of $215,000 to $225,000, the association said. One of the factors helping spur the increase in price is a lack of inventory in Maine. Houses also aren’t staying on the market very long.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers hope to repeal “archaic” provisions in the state’s spousal defense for sex crimes and sodomy laws with the reintroduction of legislation this session. Lawmakers on Thursday expect to hear a Senate bill that would repeal the use of marriage as a defense to prosecution of some sex crimes, and last week the House introduced a bill that would repeal the crimes of sodomy and unnatural or perverted sexual practice. Under current state law, a person may not be prosecuted for first- or second-degree rape or third- or fourth-degree sexual offenses if the victim is the legal spouse of the assailant at the time of the offense. The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service she thinks current law treats a spouse as property. “It’s really disrespectful, it’s wrong, and it’s antiquated,” Lee said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are planning to hold a public hearing this week for a sweeping bill filed by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker that would overhaul the state’s health care system. Baker said the bill would cut down the hidden costs that currently blindside consumers and would require walk-in clinics to treat low-income patients on Medicaid. He said the bill would also hold drug companies accountable for excessive prices and unjustified price increases, as well as support distressed community hospitals and community health centers. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at the Statehouse. When he unveiled the legislation in October, Baker said it would “address the challenges associated with supporting an aging population, individuals with a chronic illness, or those in need of behavioral health services.” The proposal would outlaw “surprise” bills for emergency room care and rein in certain hospital fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nGanges Township: The owners of a home along Lake Michigan decided to demolish it before nature did the job. Relentless waves and high water have scoured the lakeshore, destroying or threatening properties that have been in families for generations. Helen Curtis-Foster and family members decided to bring their house down in Allegan County’s Ganges Township, between Saugatuck and South Haven. The house was just feet away from the edge of a collapsing dune. “We really felt we were in the fight against time,” Curtis-Foster told MLive.com. “It was getting scary.” The demolition was completed last week, leaving only a cement pad. The job cost less than $20,000, Curtis-Foster said, compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to move the house or recover the pieces if it collapsed into the lake. The family plans to put a gazebo on the site.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: A man scaled a fence at a hospital last month and shut off oxygen to the entire facility, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County. No charges have been filed in the Dec. 27 incident at North Memorial Hospital, and the search warrant affidavit filed Friday makes no mention of injuries. But the Star Tribune reports the document says the situation could have been deadly under different circumstances. Hospital spokeswoman Katy Sullivan says hospital officials quickly identified the issue and resolved it without harm to patients. According to the affidavit, after the oxygen was shut off, engineers detected a pressure drop in the hospital’s oxygen levels and discovered the vandalism. A 39-year-old man has been identified as a possible suspect. He was also seen inside the hospital the previous month unplugging computers and televisions.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Protesters outside the Capitol on Friday condemned conditions in state prisons where inmates have died violently in the past month. People with relatives in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said at a rally that some prison cells have no working lights or toilets, and inmates are given sparse meals sometimes served with cockroaches on the trays. “Parchman is a prison farm plantation,” said Jaribu Hill, a longtime Mississippi human-rights attorney. “Shut it down!” A few hundred protesters responded: “Shut it down! Shut it down!” Their voices echoed in downtown Jackson, but many of the state’s top policymakers were not in town to hear it. Most members of the Legislature left the Capitol on Thursday and won’t return until Monday. At least 10 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December – most of them at Parchman. The rally Friday was organized by Team Roc, the charity affiliated with entertainment mogul Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri is tracking all new students on campus this semester through a cellphone app to learn whether they’re attending class. It’s a test expansion of a program the university has used for four years to track class attendance of freshmen student athletes and athletes in academic trouble. Supporters of the program say it helps attendance, which in turn improves students’ academic performance. Critics worry the university could someday add uses for the program that will violate student privacy, The Kansas City Star reports. The expanded use of the program began Tuesday on a test basis. Faculty volunteered to use the program in their classes, but students won’t have a choice about participating. Every student in the program will be told attendance is being monitored, said Jim Spain, vice provost for undergraduate studies. The university will help students who don’t have a phone participate.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana is working to learn from criticism after four white students won an essay contest about Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy, the school said. A majority of the 1,000 comments posted on social media were critical of selecting only white students, The Missoulian reports. The contest sought submissions from students, faculty and staff on how they had worked to implement King’s legacy at the university. Only six submissions were received, all from white students, the university said. The university deleted the photos and names of the contest winners out of concern they could be targets of harassment, the school said. Many commenters noted the lack of people of color entering the contest may have indicated they did not believe it was a productive use of their time or energy. African-American Studies program head Tobin Miller Shearer and Murray Pierce, special assistant to the provost and adviser to the Black Student Union, speculated that many of the union members were likely busy planning the Black Solidarity Summit, the group’s upcoming keystone event.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The mayor wants voters to decide whether they’re willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents’ wrath and complaints. Mayor Jean Stothert announced Thursday that she will ask the City Council to put a $200 million bond issue on the May 12 ballot. It would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. “We can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure,” Stothert said. “But it will take all of us to agree that it’s worth the expense.” The city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. The $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what’s needed, and Omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, Stothert said. Councilman Pete Festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Silver Dollar Club, an iconic bar dating to the Prohibition era in one of the city’s oldest buildings, is closing after 86 years of stories and songs rooted in the Wild West days. Sam Horvitz, the club proprietor, told the Elko Daily Free Press he’s closing Jan. 30. “I’ve been waiting to buy the building for years now,” Horvitz posted Jan. 3 on his Facebook page, “and my faith and patience have finally run out.” The brick building was Elko’s first bank, founded in 1880. Henderson Bank moved in 1929 to a four-story building across the railroad tracks, and the old bank became a grocery store. Local historian Jan Petersen, director of the nearby Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum, said the building became a “soft drink” parlor during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. Robert “Doby Doc” Caudill, anticipating constitutional approval for the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition in December 1933, opened the Silver Dollar Club a month earlier, in November 1933.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLangdon: A meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Georgian-style Langdon Meeting House was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. In order to comply with New Hampshire’s Toleration Act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the Universalist Society of Langdon in 1851. That year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story Greek Revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. Langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy alerted him to allegedly inappropriate behavior by his former campaign manager, including “rank misogyny” and retaliation, according to documents released Sunday. The campaign manager, Brendan Gill, who is now one of Murphy’s closest advisers, also notified Murphy directly that he apologized to that aide for losing his temper and using “language and tone” he regretted, according to an email. The documents appear to contradict Murphy’s own words in an interview last year. When asked if he was personally aware of any incident of sexual harassment or complaints of a toxic work environment during the campaign, Murphy said: “Not that I know of. No.” Murphy was included on at least two emails that showed Gill had acted inappropriately. The campaign said it conducted an investigation and found that the behavior happened only once with the woman who made the allegation, Julie Roginsky, who left the campaign in July 2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Trappers now have to complete an education course, and new restrictions will be imposed on setting wildlife traps and snares around designated trailheads and on select tracts of public lands in New Mexico, under a measure adopted by the state Game Commission. State wildlife managers suggested they tried to strike a balance, but trappers argued that the changes will be burdensome, requiring them in some instances to walk a mile roundtrip to set a trap. Environmentalists also were displeased with the decision, calling the practice inhumane and indiscriminate. They had pushed for the commission to end trapping all together, saying pets and endangered species such as the Mexican gray wolf have been inadvertently caught. Trapping and snaring triggered emotionally charged debates during last year’s legislative session.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Some 85,000 artifacts that tell the story of the Chinese migration to the United States may have been lost in a fire that struck a building in the heart of Manhattan’s Chinatown, a museum official said Friday. The president of the Museum of Chinese in America told The New York Times most of the thousands of historic and artistic items in its collection were probably lost in the fire that started Thursday night and tore through a building where the museum’s acquisitions were stored. “One hundred percent of the museum’s collection, other than what is on view,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the president of the museum. She said the collection was one of a kind, and she was “just distraught” after receiving the news. The fire started in a former school that more recently housed a senior center, the Chen Dance Center and a number of community groups. The museum is nearby and stored its collection in the structure that was hit by fire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBakersville: The “world’s worst cat” is available for adoption at the Mitchell County Animal Rescue organization. The shelter about 55 miles northeast of Asheville is waiving adoption fees in the hope that someone will take the cat named Perdita off its hands. The group says on its Facebook page, “We thought she was sick. Turns out she’s just a jerk.” A tongue-in-cheek profile of the foul-tempered feline says her dislikes include “dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS.” It says she likes lurking, pretending to be sick and “staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again … She’s single and ready to be socially awkward with a socially awkward human who understands personal space.” Her Facebook post has drawn thousands of “likes” – and a follow-up post indicated more than 50 applications to adopt her had already been submitted.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State officials say it’s time for property owners in flood-prone areas of the Red River Valley to think about buying flood insurance. The push comes as early signs suggest a heightened risk of flooding this spring. The Red River Basin in eastern North Dakota has seen record precipitation totals for the fall and winter period starting Sept. 1, National Weather Service spokesman Greg Gust said Friday after the agency released its first flood outlook of the season. This year’s flood could be a top five event, although it’s still too early to predict hard numbers, and “much is left to be determined,” Gust said. The state Water Commission and Department of Emergency Services have scheduled flood preparation meetings this week in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown that will focus on insuring homes and other structures.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state prison system wants to replace or renovate some of its high-security prisons in the near future, saying its current facilities for violent inmates are “functionally obsolete” and creating security risks for the agency, the Associated Press has learned. More low-security inmates are now being housed at community facilities instead of prisons at the same time more violent inmates are being housed in state prisons, and for longer terms, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in its capital budget request to Gov. Mike DeWine. “Furthermore, this population is particularly violent and disruptive while in prison and requires unique programming needs,” the agency said in its budget documents. The agency wants approval for a two-year design study of its options, with construction possible by mid-2023.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Leaders in this conservative state say they are looking for more legislative progress for LGBTQ people this year after notable strides in 2019. Tulsa and Oklahoma City updated their personnel policies to ban discrimination against city employees based on gender identity or expression, The Oklahoman reports. Norman went further and became the first in the state to amend its civil rights ordinance to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment or public accommodations. Oklahoma City also elected its first openly gay council member, and the mayor declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Allie Shinn, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said 2019 was a “landmark year.” A top priority in the upcoming legislative session is pushing for a ban on the widely discredited practice of “conversion therapy.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Friday that they’ve found the Portland Police Bureau in substantial compliance with 190 reforms required as part of a city settlement adopted six years ago. The settlement came after a federal investigation determined officers used excessive force against people with mental illness. Now that a community oversight group is staffed and has met regularly for more than a year, the Justice Department said the city meets the settlement’s accountability requirements. The bureau also has instituted needed changes to its use-of-force policies, training, crisis intervention tactics and employee information system developed to identify officers with excessive complaints or uses of force, the Justice Department said in court documents. The community oversight group will discuss the Justice Department’s findings at a Tuesday meeting, according to the group’s co-chair Lakayana Drury.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Carbon: A 44-acre community with fewer than 90 residents may soon end up absorbed by an adjacent city because there isn’t enough citizen interest to keep its government functioning. No one except the newly elected mayor of Mount Carbon showed up this month for a reorganizational meeting, The Morning Call of Allentown reports. The Schuylkill County borough’s fate has hung in the balance since last year, when all three council members quit and the borough secretary resigned. Retired railroad worker John Raess was elected mayor in November with two write-in votes. The newspaper said it is possible Mount Carbon might end up as part of the 15,000-resident city of Pottsville, a merger both communities would have to OK. Merging with Pottsville would mean higher taxes for Mount Carbon’s residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawmaker proposed letting legislators and other officials tint their windshields to shield them from unhappy constituents. Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat, introduced a bill Thursday that would carve out an exception for the state’s lawmakers and officials to travel around behind tinted glass, The Boston Globe reports. The bill would allow members of the General Assembly, state and municipal police officers, firefighters and state judges to be exempt from state law that says most car windows must allow 70% of the light in. “We have a lot of disgruntled individuals,” Williams said. “In the court system, law enforcement, and the General Assembly, we tend to get a bum rap, and we can face retaliation when we least expect it. When folks are on personal time, we are targeted.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nIsle of Palms: The owner of an island home is suing Airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a “fraction” of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Scott Shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. Blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. Shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. He did not say what the company paid him. He said Airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. “Airbnb’s ‘host guarantee’ is nothing close to any type of ‘guarantee’ and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive,” the lawsuit says. The company says it plans to “vigorously defend against these allegations.” Shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she has “concerns” about a bill in the House that would make it illegal for physicians to administer gender-change treatments to children under 16. But she declined Friday to offer full support or disapproval. The bill would allow for physicians who perform surgeries, administer hormone therapy or prescribe puberty-blocking medication to minors to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor. The Republican-dominated House will debate the bill this week. “When you take public policy and try to fill parenting gaps with more government, you have to be very careful about the precedent you’re setting,” Noem told reporters. Democrats and LGBT activists say the bill targets transgender children and could lead to an increase in suicides. Supporters, including many Republicans in the House, say the bill would prevent children from receiving ideologically motivated treatment that harms them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has become the latest to assure continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBT families and others based on religious beliefs. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill Friday without fanfare or an official announcement, making it the first law to be implemented in Tennessee this year. Previously, Lee said he endorsed the law because he believed defending religious liberty “is very important.” The Republican has often cited his Christian faith throughout his first term as governor. The protections afforded to religious agencies have sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which has raised legal concerns surrounding the proposal because it authorized the use of a “religious test to participate in a government program.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The mayor and others say they will work to provide assistance to residents whose homes were damaged after a massive explosion at a warehouse that killed two workers and injured 20 others. Mayor Sylvester Turner on Saturday walked through the impacted neighborhoods in northwest Houston and spoke with residents who were cleaning up after Friday’s explosion. Cleanup and repair efforts continued Sunday. The explosion happened about 4:30 a.m. Friday inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal-spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena were killed. More than 200 homes in surrounding neighborhoods were damaged as the force of the blast shattered windows, knocked down ceilings, bent garage doors and moved some homes off their foundations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s unemployment rate is now the lowest ever recorded at 2.3%, which also ties for lowest among U.S. states, state officials said Friday. The milestone comes in December data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “The job market is humming along at a feverish pace and is absorbing as much labor as possible,” said Mark Knold, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Utah was also a leader in job creation for 2019, up about 3%. The fastest growth by percentage occurred in construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality services. Washington County had the biggest job growth, followed by Rich and Iron counties. The national unemployment rate was 3.5% in December. Utah tied Vermont and South Carolina for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill in the state would take vanity license plates into new territory with the introduction of emojis. State Rep. Rebecca White, a Democrat from Windsor, introduced the proposal to let drivers add one of six available emojis to their license plate, MyNBC5 reports. Her bill went before the Committee on Transportation last week. The symbols would not replace letters or numbers assigned by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, nor those selected by a vehicle’s owner. At this point, it’s unclear what the new plates would would look like or what emojis would be allowed. Of the state’s current vanity plates, the most expensive for cars and trucks is the state conservation series, which carry a $26 annual fee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: With a newly empowered Democratic majority at the General Assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a “safe haven” for women in neighboring conservative states. Abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo Republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. A Senate committee passed that bill Thursday morning, a day after a House committee advanced that chamber’s version. The bills, which are part of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools has agreed to pay almost half a million dollars to resolve a claim involving a former student who said he was hospitalized after his elementary school released him to the wrong parent in 2010. The former student, then 8, was picked up by his father following an “incident” at the school and “seriously assaulted,” according to the settlement authorization document, which was unanimously approved by the Seattle School Board this week. The father was criminally charged and convicted after the incident, the document said. The former student and his mother filed a claim against the district in March, The Seattle Times reports. The district said the mother and former student will drop the claim in exchange for a $475,000 settlement, pending approval by King County Superior Court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is investigating three separate incidents of “hate graffiti” on its campus. A statement from the school said its police department is trying to identify who wrote the graffiti. Disciplinary action up to expulsion or dismissal could be taken if the incidents are linked back to a student or employee, the school said. The college didn’t specify what exactly was written but said two of the markings were found Thursday, and one was reported earlier this month. All three were found in restrooms on the Huntington campus. School staffers have since removed the graffiti. “This hate speech is against everything we stand for. We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators,” President Jerome Gilbert said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThree Lakes: A school district in northern Wisconsin has refurbished an old photography dark room into a place where the basic needs of its students are met. Teachers at the Three Lakes School District raised money to furnish the room with a washer and dryer to help students who might not have access to one at home. WJFW-TV reports special education teacher Nicole Lewis makes sure the room is stocked with personal essentials such as shampoo, soap, deodorant and toothbrushes. “Not many students, or adults for that matter, are able to concentrate and learn if those basic needs aren’t met,” Lewis said. “I think it’s one of those things that’s a necessity in a school.” The room is also stocked with spare clothing.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Grand Teton National Park stayed near its highest visitation levels in 2019, while Yellowstone National Park had its slowest tourism year since 2014, officials said. Grand Teton’s 2019 attendance trailed only 2018 for tourists visiting the park, The Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. A Grand Teton park spokeswoman credited increased visits during historically slow shoulder seasons, the periods between peak and off-peak seasons. Grand Teton attracted 3.4 million recreational visitors, a category excluding people who only passed through, such as commercial truckers, officials said. July was Grand Teton’s busiest month, with 776,000 visitors, while February, November and December saw fewer than 50,000 recreational visits each, officials said. Yellowstone, also in Wyoming, attracted slightly more than 4 million recreational visitors last year, a 2.3% decrease since 2018 and 5.6% decrease from the all-time high in 2016.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/us/winston-salem-fertilizer-plant-fire", "title": "Winston-Salem fertilizer plant fire: 6,000 urged to evacuate as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA fire that erupted Monday night at the Winston Weaver fertilizer plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, still poses a threat to the community Wednesday – and an evacuation radius remains in place, authorities said.\n\nThe fire is still burning at the plant and the one-mile evacuation radius that has affected thousands of people is ongoing, Bobby Wade, division chief of the Winston-Salem Fire Department said at a news conference early Wednesday.\n\n“The potential for an explosion is still there, and we have to be patient and just observe and keep those safe distances and those safe zones established until we get to a point where we can re-enter the site and start assessing that,” Wade said.\n\nThe department said it plans to tweet an update at 11 a.m.\n\nThe fire forced emergency responders to urge the evacuation of about 6,000 people, including Wake Forest University students and more than 200 inmates from a nearby prison.\n\nThe potential for an ammonium nitrate explosion at the plant was a top concern, fire officials said, as authorities scrambled to evacuate almost 2,500 homes within a mile of the blaze.\n\nThere were 600 tons of ammonium nitrate and 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer on the site, Winston-Salem Fire Chief Trey Mayo said Tuesday. That compares with the 240 tons of ammonium nitrate at a West, Texas, fertilizer plant blast that killed 15 people in 2013. Winston-Salem is more densely populated than rural West, Texas.\n\n“If that doesn’t convey the gravity of this situation and how serious folks need to take it, I don’t know how else to verbalize that,” Mayo said.\n\nThe fire burns Monday. Allison Lee Isley/AP\n\nThrough aerial surveillance, officials have been able to determine that there is no imminent heat threat to the rail car on the back of the facility that contains about 100 tons of ammonium nitrate, according to Mayo.\n\nOfficials on Tuesday were able to shut off two lines that were flowing natural gas into the vicinity of the fertilizer plant, the fire chief said.\n\nAs the winds begin to shift into the evening, Mayo warned residents that they will be able to see a haze in the air, and they will begin to smell an odor similar to “spent fireworks.”\n\nThe odor is from irritants and not considered toxic, he said.\n\nStill, people with “sensitive respiratory systems” should avoid being outside, Mayo said.\n\n“We do not encourage folks to be out exercising, running and walking and doing that sort of thing,” he said.\n\nResidents urged to evacuate\n\nAt one point, fire trucks were driving down every road in the evacuation zone – and going door to door in some places – using a public address system to urge residents to evacuate, Winston-Salem Fire Department Battalion Chief Patrick Grubbs said early Tuesday.\n\nThe blaze began Monday night at the plant. After battling it for two hours, the fire department pulled back its crews after the blaze spread to the rail car containing ammonium nitrate, Grubbs said.\n\n“Right now, the fire is still active, and there’s still potential for explosion. We’re asking all the citizens to evacuate the area for a one-mile radius around it,” he said Tuesday morning. “We do not know the full extent of the time we’ll be here. It will not be anytime soon that we’ll be leaving.”\n\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation, Grubbs said, and the fire department has been in touch with the company that owns the plant. The Winston Weaver Co. did not respond immediately to CNN’s request for information.\n\nOn the City of Winston-Salem Facebook page, a company official said there had been no injuries or loss of life.\n\n“We will continue working with first responders and relevant officials to ensure safety of the community, and we would participate fully in the investigation into the cause of the fire,” he said.\n\nMayor Pro Tempore Denise Adams heard sirens around 7 p.m., Monday, then a “tremendous boom,” while watching TV, she said.\n\nThe fertilizer plant had passed a routine inspection in December, officials said.\n\nInmates moved and students advised to say indoors\n\nAuthorities moved about 220 inmates from Forsyth Correctional Center to the minimum-security Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville, about a 90-minute drive west of Winston-Salem, said North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokesperson John Bull.\n\nThere was no imminent threat to the Forsyth facility, Bull said. Emergency officials recommended moving the prisoners as a precaution. They’ll be returned to Forsyth when it’s safe, he said.\n\nWake Forest University canceled classes Tuesday, the university said. The evacuation area includes a unit of on-campus housing, Deacon Place, and students on campus or living outside the 1-mile zone are encouraged to stay indoors and keep their windows closed, the school said. The Wellbeing Center, Benson Center and Z. Smith Reynolds Library are open for faculty, staff or students who need a place to stay.\n\n“Travel in the evacuation area around 4400 North Cherry Street will become increasingly difficult as police begin to shut down roads and prohibit vehicle traffic. Faculty, staff and students are encouraged to evacuate as soon as possible. Use personal vehicles and carpool when possible. Parking anywhere on campus is allowed,” Wake Forest said early Tuesday.\n\nAt least 90 firefighters and up to about 150 emergency personnel – including police and others – have been working on the fire and evacuating the area, Grubbs said.", "authors": ["Chris Boyette Amy Simonson", "Chris Boyette", "Amy Simonson"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/us/tennessee-interracial-family-fire-hate-crime-reaj", "title": "'This was a hate crime': A year after a fire destroyed their house, an ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: In this series finale of “This is Life with Lisa Ling,” the show profiles interracial couples. The series airs this Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\nA year after his Tennessee home was burned down and a racial slur was spray-painted on his property, Alan Mays says he’s still pleading with authorities for answers to what he’s calling a hate crime.\n\nAuthorities are actively investigating the cause of the fire that destroyed the family’s seven-bedroom home in Ripley last November, but Mays says he’s growing disillusioned as his family is now facing homelessness. “We were never given any kind of closure,” the Iraq War veteran told CNN.\n\nMays, who is Black, claims that authorities are treating the fire as an accident despite a documented pattern of harassment against his multiracial family. From repeated break-ins to security camera footage of people shouting racial slurs around their house, Mays says his family has been targeted for years.\n\nIf he were a White man, this would have been settled in 2015 when he says the harassment originally began, Mays said. “They did not go after anybody. They didn’t try. They didn’t want me out there,” Mays said.\n\nThe fire occurred early in the morning on November 1, 2021, while the Mays family was away on vacation. Firefighters arrived at their home because their fire alarm was going off and a neighbor had called in saying she could see flames from the house, according to the incident report from the Ripley Fire Department.\n\nThe report also states there was no nearby water source, so water had to be shuttled from other county departments, though Mays says there’s a fire hydrant at the end of his street.\n\nThe house was a “total loss,’” the report states. It also notes “graffiti” had been painted on a wall above their pool.\n\nMays says that graffiti was a spray-painted racial slur: “n***er lover.” When the fire chief told him about the loss of his home and that slur, Mays said he could do nothing but cry.\n\nThe Ripley Police Department and Ripley Fire Department both did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTennessee law prohibits an incident being called a hate crime until authorities have identified a suspect, which law enforcement has yet to do. As a result, the case is currently pending as a “suspicious fire.”\n\n\"It's like a war zone,\" Lisa Ling said as she walked around their destroyed home.\n\n“We are limited in what we’re able to release as our investigation into the incident remains active and ongoing,” the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation told CNN in an emailed statement.\n\nThe last time Mays spoke to the bureau was in April, he said, and he’s yet to receive any information.\n\n“To this day, they’ve told us nothing about what happened in our house,” Mays said. “They’ve told us about no kind of suspect. They’ve told us nothing.”\n\nWhen the bureau initially surveyed the scene last November, they didn’t want to investigate the spray-painted slur, and instead wanted to focus solely on the origins of the fire, Mays said.\n\nBut that didn’t make any sense to him, he said. To Mays, that slur is much more than graffiti – it’s a message to leave and never return; it’s a message of hate.\n\nInterracial marriage has seen a steady rise in the United States since 1967 when the Supreme Court overturned anti-miscegenation laws, and according to Gallup, most American adults now approve of marriage between Black and White people.\n\nBut some studies suggest that rates of disapproval regarding interracial relationships are underestimated. It’s no secret that interracial couples still face discrimination and hostility from others, sometimes even leading to violence.\n\nMays, whose Army service ended with an honorable discharge after a rocket blast injured him in 2009, told CNN navigating this past year has been the most difficult thing he’s ever experienced.\n\nHis entire family has been left traumatized by the fire, Mays says. His children are confused and have recurring nightmares. His wife cries often and takes medication for chronic anxiety attacks, and they’ve both been receiving therapy through benefits provided by the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nSince the fire claimed their home, Mays said he and his family have been staying in an apartment complex south of Nashville. But he said they’ll be homeless next week because their insurance company won’t pay for their housing anymore.\n\n“So, what am I gonna do? I’m a nervous wreck. I haven’t slept in two nights, okay, because I don’t know what to do,” Mays told CNN. “I’m lost … I’ve done everything I could do. I did everything the right way.”\n\nReports indicate that firefighters tried to contain the blaze. Additional units were called in from nearby towns. But Alan and Kirsten's house was completely engulfed.\n\nStrange events in ‘the city of hospitality’\n\nMays married his wife, who is White, in 2012 in Germany. They moved to Ripley, a small city nearly 60 miles from Memphis, in 2015.\n\nAffectionately known as “the city of hospitality,” Mays initially appreciated the God-fearing nature of this community.\n\n“They have their Bibles; they go to church. It seemed like a place that you’d want to have your family,” Mays said.\n\nThough Ripley’s population is nearly 40% White and more than 54% Black, according to the US Census Bureau, Mays said he was the only Black man living in the predominantly White subdivision.\n\nAfter the fire, none of his neighbors offered his family any help – or even extended condolences, he told CNN.\n\nMays said this reaffirmed the pattern of strange events that his family had experienced since moving to the neighborhood. They’ve had to deal with strangers parking at the bottom of their driveway at night and taking pictures of them, poisoning their dogs, breaking into their garage, flying drones over their house and other disturbing instances, Mays claims.\n\nHis burglar alarm went off 37 times between 2020 and 2021, and he’s kept all 20 of the police reports he’d filed concerning these puzzling incidents, he said.\n\n“There were always things happening at my house,” Mays said. “And I told my wife after they tried to poison our dogs, ‘Listen, that’s how they do it in the South. They mess with your cars, your animals.’”\n\n“I said, ‘something’s ‘finna happen here, and it’s not good,’” he added.\n\nTheir security cameras have captured multiple videos of people around their house and sometimes shouting racial slurs, according to Mays. They even caught images of a figure standing inside Mays’ bedroom, he said. But authorities could never identify anyone, Mays said.\n\nMays had to buy six new security cameras in a year and a half because they were constantly being tampered with, he added. The night of the blaze, he had not yet replaced the last set of ruined cameras.\n\nKirsten Mays, Alan’s wife, said she doesn’t want to live in the United States anymore after what their family has gone through. Originally from Germany, she said she expected more from law enforcement in this country.\n\nWhen she and her husband went to the police station after one instance when someone broke into their home, she said that the extent of their help was to tell them to change their locks and get better cameras.\n\n“It’s no way possible that people are living like this and treating you like this, and no one does anything to defend you,” she said.\n\n‘We believed in the system’\n\nOn top of his community’s apparent indifference and the authorities’ perceived inaction, Mays told CNN that he’s also been having trouble with his insurance company.\n\nHe filed a homeowner’s insurance claim with Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance immediately after his house burned down. He filed a complaint against them on September 21 for taking too long to give him a decision. They eventually sent him two similar denial letters on October 3 and October 13 – nearly a year after Mays filed the claim.\n\nThe October 3 denial concluded that the Mays family may have conspired to start the fire themselves and that Mays did not inform them of a pending lawsuit against him for an unpaid credit card. The October 13 denial similarly asserts that Mays did not notify the company of a felony charge for passing a bad check in 2001 — which a judge dismissed years ago, according to court records.\n\n“We gave the insurance company every piece of information they asked for,” Mays said. “We did every interview.”\n\nIn a hotel room where his family had been living out of suitcases, Alan Mays said: \"You take your worst nightmare, you put yourself in it every day, every day. I'm exhausted.\"\n\nBut despite these letters, Mays received correspondence on November 4 that his claim had not been wholly denied, which just confuses him. He’s exhausted with all the different answers.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance told CNN in an emailed statement, “Please understand that Tennessee Farmers Insurance Company takes every fire claim very seriously, and review of those claims often involves extensive investigation. We of course cannot comment on specific investigations, claims, or litigation.”\n\nAmid the difficulties last year, Mays’ brother created a GoFundMe to assist in rebuilding their lives.\n\nWhether it’s Mays’ former neighbors, Ripley’s fire and police departments, his insurance company, or even federal investigators, Mays feels there has been failure after failure in keeping his family safe and receiving justice.\n\nThe social systems meant to protect them have fallen through, Mays said.\n\n“We believed in the system,” Mays said. “I fought for that system. And then when it came time for the system to reach out and help us, it has done nothing but let us down.”", "authors": ["Jalen Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/europe/kyiv-russian-convoy-intl", "title": "Kyiv: The 40 mile-long Russian convoy has moved.

The images were taken at 11:37 a.m. local time (4.37 a.m. ET) on Thursday.\n\nAccording to the satellite imagery, Russian military vehicles are seen sitting on roadways in residential areas in the town of Ozera – 17 miles northwest of Kyiv and just north of the Russian-controlled Antonov Airbase in Hostomel.\n\nTowed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in a sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka.

Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nTowed artillery and other vehicles are seen taking cover in sparse patches of trees near Lubyanka – about 3 miles (northwest of the Antonov Airbase.\n\nIn Berestyanka – 10 miles west of the airbase – a number of fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field near trees.\n\nThe satellite images taken on Thursday appear to also show fuel storage tanks on fire at the airbase, with a thick black plume of smoke seen rising from the tanks, located at the southern end of the airbase.\n\nHostomel’s airbase has been the site of intense clashes with Ukrainian forces since the start of Russia’s invasion. It was reportedly captured by the Russian military on February 24.\n\nAt the end of what was the convoy, a number of trucks and equipment are still seen on the roadway southeast of Ivankiv.\n\nSatellite images from Maxar also show significant damage to parts of the northern city of Chernihiv and the northwest suburbs of Kyiv.\n\nIn Borodyanka, a series of apartment buildings is seen demolished. CNN has previously reported that these apartment buildings were damaged by Russian military strikes.\n\nJust outside of Kyiv’s city limits in Stoyanka, a warehouse is seen in a satellite image completely gutted by fire.\n\nIn the city of Chernihiv, roughly 80 miles northeast of Kyiv, the Epicenter K supermarket is also destroyed by fire. The charred remains of the building is seen; there is no more roof.\n\nA fire is also seen burning in one of Chernihiv’s industrial districts, located on its south side.\n\nRussia reorientates\n\nUkrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday as fighting picked up around Kyiv’s northeast and east\n\nAn overnight airstrike in the Brovary district, just east of the capital, caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities.\n\nUkrainian authorities report a missile strike in the town of Baryshivka overnight some 45 miles east of the capital.\n\n“According to preliminary information, the Iskander missile caused significant damage to infrastructure and housing. 60 apartment houses were completely damaged, 4 apartment buildings and 10 private houses were partially damaged,” they said.\n\nSeveral fuel trucks and what Maxar says appear to be multiple rocket launchers are seen positioned in a field in Berestyanka. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThomas Bullock, an analyst at Janes, a UK-based intelligence service, told CNN that “Ukraine’s tactic of targeting supply lines has worked well especially during the first five-10 days of the war. This was partially down to Ukrainian tactics and partially down to how Russia was operating.”\n\nThe Russian forces “prioritized rushing forward to secure objectives quickly” in the first couple days of the invasion. This meant “they weren’t advancing as a coherent frontline securing territory as they go. This effectively allowed Ukrainian forces to slip behind Russia’s advanced mechanized units and attack logistics columns traveling on unsecured roads in the rear.”\n\nBut as “Russia begins to reorient its forces for a longer war following their failure to secure a quick victory” it is “unclear how effective this tactic will be,” Bullock added.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defense update added that logistical issues continue to hamper the Russian advance “as does strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\nFrench armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni reiterated the UK assessment on Friday, saying the Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, “particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,” he told French TV station France2.\n\n“It is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,” he said.\n\nThe convoy is believed to have entered Ukraine via Belarus, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and where Russia moved huge numbers of troops to in recent weeks to carry out what they called joint exercises. When the exercises ended, the troops didn’t leave and satellite images actually showed that Russia increased their military presence in the country.\n\nThe convoy’s dispersal comes after major cities in Ukraine – including Dnipro in the center and Lutsk in the far west of the country – were attacked by Russian forces Friday.\n\nAs Ukrainian officials attempt to open evacuation routes on Friday around Kyiv, the United Nations said 2.5 million people had fled the country and 2 million people are displaced within Ukraine.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Paul P.

University trustees announced the gift from Dr. Marnix Heersink on Tuesday. The medical school will be named for Heersink, and the money will be used to establish global health and biomedical innovation institutes, university officials said. An additional $5 million is being contributed by Triton Health Systems, bringing the total pledge to $100 million. The money will also help recruit and retain scientists and physicians in priority areas such as pulmonology, oncology and neurology through endowed chairs and professorships, officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second hospital in Alaska has invoked crisis standards of care, allowing a committee of physicians to determine clinical decisions regarding patient treatment as the state continues to see a spike in COVID-19 cases. The Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp. in Bethel announced the activation of the guidelines in a statement posted on its website Wednesday, the same day the facility was operating at capacity. The standards allow overwhelmed hospitals to modify their usual, expected level of care. Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, the state’s largest health care facility, earlier invoked the same guidelines. Health officials at the Bethel hospital said there might be delays transferring people to a referring hospital, along with expanded nurse-patient ratio and longer wait times for elective procedures such as colonoscopies and pediatric dental procedures. The decision to continue these types of elective procedures are made on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Passenger rail service is one step closer to returning to Phoenix for the first time in 25 years as a federal infrastructure plan that would provide billions for rail gains traction in Congress. As part of a nationwide expansion, Amtrak is proposing to connect Tucson to Phoenix for the first time since 1996. The plan calls for extending the line through the West Valley, where it would then connect to Los Angeles. Phoenix is the largest city in the country without Amtrak service. Service never resumed after shutting down in June 1996 for a criminal investigation into the derailment of a train in western Arizona that killed a crewman and injured 78 people. Rail service runs from Tucson to Los Angeles through Maricopa, which is about 35 miles south of Phoenix. The plan has received support from mayors along the proposed line. About a dozen mayors from both political parties sent a letter on Tuesday to the state’s congressional delegation calling on lawmakers to provide funding to implement the new route. They said the route would diversify transportation options, connect the state’s two largest metropolitan areas and spur development along the line.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers considered competing redistricting proposals that would divide the state’s most populous county between congressional seats on Wednesday. The House and Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committees did not advance any proposals for redrawing districts as the Legislature reconvened to redraw the state’s four U.S. House boundaries. Both panels showed support for plans that would divide Pulaski County. One bill pending before the House committee would split the county, which includes the Little Rock area, between the 1st and 2nd congressional districts. Another before the Senate panel would split the county between the 2nd and 4th districts. Pulaski is part of the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent elections. Republicans hold all four of the state’s congressional seats and majorities in both chambers of the Legislature. Proponents of splitting up Pulaski have said it makes sense given the county’s location in the state’s center and that it could prevent dividing up even more counties around the state. But Democrats in Pulaski County oppose the move, saying it would divide the community. Arkansas’ current congressional map divides up five counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDublin: Ray J. Garcia, the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute Dublin in California’s San Francisco Bay area, has been charged with sexually abusing an inmate, authorities said Wednesday. Garcia, 54, of Merced, allegedly groped at least one of his female wards, asked at least two inmates to strip naked for him and took and stored photographs of a naked inmate in a cell at the prison, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office. Garcia also is accused of trying to deter a victim from reporting the abuse by telling her “that he was ‘close friends’ with the individual responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct by inmates and … that he could not be fired,” according to the statement. Garcia was associate warden at the all-female low-security lockup at the time of the alleged abuse, prosecutors said. He later became warden but was placed on leave in July and he was charged last week with sexual abuse of a ward. It’s the latest of at least three sexual abuse cases involving employees at FCI Dublin, located 20 miles southeast of Oakland.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A judge on Wednesday dismissed an attempt by a group of Denver police officers to block the city’s vaccine mandate from taking effect. In a lawsuit filed last week, seven officers claimed the city lacked the authority to impose the mandate under a local disaster emergency declared by Mayor Michael Hancock at the beginning of the pandemic. They noted Democratic Gov. Jared Polis rescinded his statewide emergency pandemic order in July. The officers said the city should have instead followed the more drawn-out process laid out in state law to impose regulations. However, Judge Shelley Gilman ruled that law applies only to state agencies. Under city law, the officers should have appealed the vaccine mandate, first issued on Aug. 2, to the health board before filing a lawsuit, she said. Since they did not, Gilman said she had no jurisdiction to decide the case and dismissed it, granting a request made by the city in its response to the lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nCoventry: Uncertainty about the species of a massive catfish that was eaten before it could be vetted by authorities in August has led Connecticut to withdraw its awarding of a new state record. Connecticut Fish and Wildlife wrote in a Facebook post on Monday that because it was not able to examine the actual fish, authorities cannot confirm it was a white catfish. “Without the ability to examine the actual fish, identification is left to still images and videos, which have proven to be ambiguous and inconclusive to definitively identify the species of catfish in this case,” state Fish and Wildlife wrote, adding that it is not disputing the weight of the catch that was made on Aug. 21. Ben Tomkunas, 25, of Coventry, who caught the 21.3-pound fish, said he gave it to his grandfather the morning after he caught it and it was eaten. “I can’t believe that they think it’s OK to do this to someone,” Tomkunas told the Journal Inquirer. “It’s such an embarrassment.” It can be difficult to distinguish between white catfish and channel catfish, which are generally larger. The previous state record for a white catfish was 12.7 pounds. The International Game Fish Association has recorded the world record for a white catfish catch to be 19.3 pounds for a fish caught in 2005 in California.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Wilmington officer has been placed on administrative duty after video circulating on social media showed him repeatedly banging a man’s head during an arrest, news outlets reported. The Wilmington Police Department said its Office of Professional Standards immediately launched an investigation into the Sept. 21 incident. A clip from a security video circulating online showed an officer shove a man in a convenience store, then grab his head and slam it twice into plexiglass before taking him down. “It shows clear abuse of power and unwarranted excessive force,” said Wilmington activist Coby Owens. “That’s 100% unacceptable.” Police said the patrol officer has been with the department for three years, but didn’t identify him. “The video of this incident is concerning and we will conduct a thorough investigation and take any necessary action to ensure all of our members adhere to the highest standards of service to our community,” police department spokesman David Karas said. Police were responding to a report that the man harassed daycare employees, Karas said. Court documents that the officer signed state that “after a brief physical struggle (that the man) attempted to physically resist, he was taken into custody.” He was charged with harassment, resisting arrest and other offenses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Through Oct. 15, Metro customers will be able to save up to 50% on select passes, WUSA-TV reported. For the first time, Metro launched a sales event that will allow riders to purchase discounted passes with unlimited trips on Metrorail and Metrobus, whether they travel one day, one week or one month. During the sale, customers can purchase the one-, three-, and seven-day passes to use anytime. Monthly passes will be valid for use from Friday to Oct. 31, Metro said in a release. “This is a great way to come back to work, restaurants, theater, museums, sports events and outdoor activities this fall with a pass that lets you ride at a deep discount,” said Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld in a statement. “We have also enhanced cleaning on buses and trains and improved the ventilation, making it safer and now more affordable for customers to give Metro a try.” Along with fare and service improvements, Metro officials hope the pass sale will attract riders back to Metro following a dip in ridership because of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers:Florida’s grasshopper sparrow subspecies was the rarest bird in the continental U.S. just a few years ago, but a captive breeding program has numbers climbing. In the past three years, Audubon Florida has helped release almost 500 grasshopper sparrows from a captive breeding program. “It was scary because you have this bird you’ve raised in captivity and you just throw them out in the wild but it turned out that they did very well,” said Paul Gray, a bird expert and scientist with Audubon Florida. Grasshopper sparrows can be found from the Orlando area south to Lake Okeechobee – in Highlands, Okeechobee, Osceola and Polk counties. Males establish their territories from March to July by producing a series of calls, or songs, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Grasshopper sparrows build dome-shaped nests from grasses that are typically found beside or under a dwarf oak or saw palmetto. Breeding occurs throughout the year, and the grasshopper sparrow might nest upward of three times during a season. Three to five eggs are laid, with hatching taking place in 11 to 12 days. Like many endangered and threatened species in Florida, habitat loss is one of the top threats for the tiny sparrows. Grasshopper sparrow habitat can also be degraded when vegetation becomes overgrown (Florida’s landscape evolved with regular fires), or when invasive species work their way into the grasses and take over.\n\nGeorgia\n\nKingsland: A federal agency said it’s again delaying a final decision on whether to permit construction of a launchpad for commercial rockets on the Georgia coast. The Federal Aviation Administration now plans to issue a decision on Spaceport Camden by Nov. 3 “due to ongoing consultation efforts,” agency spokesman Steve Kulm said in a statement. Previously, the FAA had said it intended to make a final determination on the project by the end of July, then shifted its target date to the end of September. Camden County in Georgia’s coastal, southeast corner has spent nine years and $10 million seeking permission to build what would be the nation’s 13th licensed commercial spaceport. The proposal took a big step forward in June, when the FAA issued an environmental impact study that concluded building the spaceport would be its “preferred alternative.” The National Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, pushed back over the summer. They disputed the FAA’s conclusion that the spaceport poses minimal risks or adverse impacts to Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness that lies along the proposed flight path for rockets 5 miles east of the launch site.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: More than 160 Oahu business operators have been cited, warned or arrested in the weeks since Honolulu imposed new COVID-19 safety rules, including requiring proof of vaccination or negative test results. Honolulu police have issued citations or made arrests in 44 cases since the new mandates went into effect Sept. 13, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Police have also issued over 100 written warnings for a variety of violations and made an unspecified number of “verbal, non-written warnings.” City officials could not immediately break down the number of arrests versus citations because they are compiled together in the same records-keeping category, said Honolulu Police Department spokesperson Michelle Yu. But she said the majority were citations, and very few were arrests. The greatest number of arrests or citations – 17 – were for lack of face coverings, and 11 were for not following social or physical distances. Violations carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A coalition of journalists is asking an Idaho judge to hold the state’s lieutenant governor in contempt of court for refusing to turn over public documents despite the judge’s order that she do so. Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, a Republican, was ordered more than a month ago to release the documents regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Idaho Press Club on behalf of several journalists who said McGeachin’s office wrongly denied their public records requests for the material. But McGeachin never released the public documents despite multiple attempts from the Idaho Press Club’s attorney, Wendy Olson, to get McGeachin to comply, according to court documents filed Wednesday. McGeachin earlier filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider the case, but then never filed the supporting documentation required by the judge. McGeachin did not immediately respond to a voice mail and email from the Associated Press requesting comment. The Idaho Press Club said in a prepared statement that it is “truly unfortunate” that the case reached the point where the organization had to file the contempt of court petition.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A northern Illinois man has died of rabies after apparently being bitten by a bat – the first human case of rabies in the state since 1954, health officials reported Tuesday. The diagnosis has been confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health said in a release. The man’s name was not released. Officials said he was in his 80s and lived in Lake County. He woke up in mid-August and found a bat on his neck. The bat was captured and later tested positive for rabies. The man declined to begin post-exposure rabies treatment, health officials said. The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system and causes disease and brain death. The man began experiencing neck pain, a headache, difficulty controlling his arms, finger numbness, difficulty speaking and other symptoms of the disease. A bat colony later was found in his home. “Sadly, this case underscores the importance of raising public awareness about the risk of rabies exposure in the United States,” Lake County Health Department Executive Director Mark Pfister said. “Rabies infections in people are rare in the United States, however, once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal, making it vital that an exposed person receive appropriate treatment to prevent the onset of rabies as soon as possible.” Thirty bats have tested positive in Illinois this year for rabies, according to the health department.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: Preliminary tests indicated iron-contaminated wastewater that leaked from a northwestern Indiana steel plant into a Lake Michigan tributary presented no risk to public health, the Environmental Protection Agency said. U.S. Steel Midwest idled the plant in Portage, about 30 miles east of Chicago, as a precaution after it said a wastewater treatment facility experienced “an upset condition” that sent the rusty colored plume containing elevated levels of lead into the Burns Waterway on Sunday. The EPA said it tested surface water samples taken near the plant’s outfall. Federal and state agencies were continuing to investigate the cause of the discharge, possible Clean Water Act compliance issues and impacts to the environment, the agency said. The plant was back up and running Wednesday, according to The (Northwest Indiana) Times. Indiana Dunes National Park also closed all of its beaches and the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk until further notice and Indiana American Water shut down its Ogden Dunes treatment facility, both as a precaution.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Mayor Bruce Teague has “indefinitely extended” the city’s emergency order requiring masks in indoor gathering spots and when social distancing is not possible. The emergency order, first issued on Aug. 19, was set to expire Thursday. “We have to do what we can individually to protect ourselves, as well as everyone else,” Teague said. He said a number of factors went into his decision to extend the mandate indefinitely. He noted the prevalence of the delta variant and Johnson County’s high level of community transmission – a problem in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Face coverings will continue to be required in indoor public settings such as grocery and retail stores, pharmacies, restaurants and bars, movie theaters and houses of worship, among other locations in the city. Masks are also required when using public transportation, taxis or ride share. The order also requires masks be worn in public school buildings and in University of Iowa academic buildings and businesses offices. But UI administrators previously advised campus leaders that the mandate does not apply to them because of state law. And the Iowa City Community School District unanimously reinstated its own mask mandate earlier this month after a federal judge issued a restraining order barring the state from enforcing a law that prevents local school boards from issuing mask mandates.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Thousands of people turned out Wednesday to honor a Kansas priest as he was laid to rest 70 years after he died in a prisoner of war camp during the Korean War. Mourners filled Hartman Arena for a funeral service for the Rev. Emil Kapaun and later lined streets to watch his body being carried by a horse-drawn caisson from Veterans Memorial Park to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, where he was interred. “We are here today to provide for father what was not provided for him 70 years ago, a mass of Christian burial,” Bishop Carl A. Kemme of the Wichita diocese told the crowd. Speakers extolled Kapaun’s Christian love and his courage during his days as a prisoner or war, which he spent providing comfort to his fellow soldiers. They also said it was appropriate that his body had finally returned to the state where he was born. Kapaun, an Army chaplain, was captured in 1950 near Unsan, North Korea, while tending to fellow soldiers. He died in May 1951 at the POW camp while continuing to minister to fellow prisoners. He was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2013. In 1993, the Catholic church named him a “Servant of God,” the first step of a lengthy process that could lead to canonization.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Statewide test results from last spring showed that less than half of students scored at the proficient or distinguished levels in many Kentucky schools. The tests scores were aimed at better understanding how students performed academically amid learning disruptions caused by COVID-19. State education officials cautioned the latest test scores can’t be compared with pre-pandemic scores. Students faced challenges as schools switched to remote learning for months because of the pandemic. “We knew these results would not be what we wanted to see, but the previous two school years saw extreme challenges,” state Education Commissioner Jason Glass said in a news release Wednesday. “We can use this information to address the gaps caused by COVID-19 disruptions and provide our students with the supports they need to be successful.” Because the pandemic affected many aspects of education in the past school year, the state Education Department received a waiver from federal accountability. As a result, school accountability indicators and ratings weren’t part of the 2020-2021 reporting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana has recovered a missing lunar rock gifted to the state to commemorate the last manned U.S. mission to the moon after it turned up in the hands of a man who recycles wooden plaques. The rock from the 1972 Apollo 17 landing was in the possession of the Louisiana State Museum on Tuesday, The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported. It was returned to the state late last year by a Florida man who planned to use wood from the plaque that held it to repair a gun, according to the newspaper. But the recovery was not revealed until Monday when a journalist and space historian, Robert Pearlman, reported it in the online publication CollectSpace, The Advocate said. “As you can appreciate, I’m just happy that it is here now,” museum interim Director Steven Maklansky said. The lunar fragment was one of hundreds presented to states, territories and foreign nations in the early to mid-1970s by the administration of former President Richard Nixon. They included samples taken by Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew during the first moon landing in 1969. But many of them later went missing. Louisiana also had an Apollo 11 rock that was thought to be missing, but The Advocate discovered it was in storage at the Louisiana Art and Science Museum.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: A tuna weighing 600 pounds was donated to a Belfast soup kitchen for its meals last week by a lobster fishing crew that netted the fish. The crewmembers from J & J Lobster were catching bait near the coast when the massive bluefin tuna hit their net, the Bangor Daily News reported. “It was an adrenaline rush to say the least,” the owner of J & J Lobster, Jamie Steeves, told New England Cable News. The crew was not initially authorized to bring the tuna to shore, since they were fishing specifically for bait. But Steeves called the state Marine Patrol, which said it would allow the crew to bring the fish in if they could find a place to donate it. They reached out to the Belfast Soup Kitchen and its executive director, Cherie Merrill. “He cold-called, asking ‘Can you use a 600-pound tuna?’ ” Merrill told the Bangor Daily News. “I never say no to anything, but all I could picture was dropping this 600-pound fish off at the door.” Volunteers from the kitchen and J & J Lobster salvaged about 300 pounds of meat from the tuna. The first tuna steaks were served Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A conservative Roman Catholic media outlet seeking to stage a rally during a U.S. bishops’ meeting in Baltimore claims city officials canceled the event because they disapproved of its religious message. The city said the gathering posed a threat to public safety, claiming the fringe group cheered on rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January. The event planners are asking a federal judge to decide whether the city is trampling on their First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander scheduled a hearing Thursday on a lawsuit filed Sept. 13 by St. Michael’s Media against the city, Mayor Brandon Scott and City Solicitor James Shea. Michigan-based St. Michael’s Media, also known as Church Militant, is a tax-exempt nonprofit and digital media outlet. The group said it publishes news stories on its website about the Catholic Church and often criticizes church leadership. St. Michael’s planned to hold a “prayer rally” Nov. 16 at a city-owned waterfront pavilion. An event advertisement touted speeches by former President Donald Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and activist Milo Yiannopoulos. In a court filing, the city said it instructed the contractor that manages the pavilion to cancel the event “out of a legitimate fear that it would incite violence in the heart of downtown Baltimore.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Supreme Judicial Court rejected a claim that county jails across the state violated the due process rights of inmates during the coronavirus pandemic. The state public defenders agency and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued the sheriffs who run the jails failed to implement regular across-the-board coronavirus testing, and they had not adequately followed an earlier court ruling to reduce their inmate populations, The Salem News reported. The Supreme Judicial Court in Tuesday’s decision acknowledged the risks COVID-19 posed to inmates, but said under the circumstances, the responses of the 13 county sheriffs “are not unreasonable.” The public defender’s agency, the Committee for Public Counsel Services, had no response to the decision, a spokesperson said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State lawmakers are poised to consider bipartisan bills aimed at helping potentially thousands of sex abuse victims sue for damages, including those molested by a University of Michigan sports physician. It is the second time since 2018 the Legislature might overhaul laws in the wake of a major abuse scandal. Similar legislation was enacted following the conviction of Larry Nassar, who sexually abused hundreds of female athletes under the guise of medical treatment, including at Michigan State University. Under the new measures, victims of the late Dr. Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan and others would get additional time to bring lawsuits that might be barred by a statute of limitations. Government entities could not use the immunity defense if they knew or should have known of an accused’s prior sexual misconduct and failed to intervene. Similar government immunity legislation stalled three years ago – after Michigan State agreed to a $500 million settlement for Nassar’s victims – amid pushback from universities, schools, municipalities, businesses and the Catholic Church over the financial implications of facing an unknown number of suits for old allegations. Opposition could form again.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State wildlife officials said two Minnesota farms received deer from a Wisconsin farm where chronic wasting disease was detected last month. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said the news was “extremely concerning” and the agency is “actively considering management responses” to the threat facing the state’s wild deer population. A recent report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said that the Wisconsin deer farm where the disease was detected sold nearly 400 deer to 40 farms across seven states in the past five years. Two of those farms were in Minnesota. One was at a now-defunct farm in Stillwater, which received two deer in 2016. Those deer were eventually transferred back to Wisconsin in 2019. Investigators are working to determine if those deer are still alive and have been tested, WCCO-TV reported. The other Minnesota farm to receive deer from the contaminated farm was in Clear Lake. Officials said the farm received three deer in 2017, two of which were killed earlier this year. The disease was not detected in them. The third deer is still alive and the owner is awaiting payment befoe making the animal available for testing. The Clear Lake farm’s entire herd is under quarantine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two street preachers who were convicted of misdemeanor simple assault for calling a woman a “Jezebel” and waving a Bible in a man’s face were released from jail Wednesday after a judge found they were being held under “grossly unreasonable” bond.The $500,000 appearance bond for each preacher was at least 500 times the amount recommended by the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure for bail pending trial. “I’ve seen bonds set in rape cases, aggravated assault cases far more serious than this, and nowhere near half a million dollars,” said Judge Jess H. Dickinson, a retired Mississippi Supreme Court justice appointed to help with a backload of cases in Hinds County Court. Dickinson reduced the bond to $5,000 each. Allan Grant Siders and Bryan Peden, preachers for Church at Jackson, were convicted Sept. 22. Jackson Municipal Judge Jeffrey Reynolds sentenced Siders to six months and Peden to three months in jail. The men were preaching outside businesses in Jackson’s Fondren neighborhood when Jackson resident Matthew Camp said they shouted at him and his girlfriend repeatedly using a voice amplification system, calling her a “Jezebel” and calling them “filthy fornicators.” He said they waved a Bible in his face in a threatening way and yelled at him so closely that spit landed on his face.\n\nMissouri\n\nChesterfield: Racist graffiti found on school bathroom walls in suburban St. Louis that led to a mass student walkout last week was scrawled by a Black student, school district officials said. The student admitted to administrators to writing the graffiti in multiple bathrooms at Parkway Central High School, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. In a letter to students, their families and staff on Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Marty said the student’s race “does not diminish the hurt it caused or the negative impact it has on our entire community.” Marty said the vandalism was a significant violation of multiple codes of conduct and that the matter had been referred to law enforcement. He also said the student would face “severe disciplinary consequences,” but did not details what those would be. Hundreds of students at Parkway Central walked out of class in protest last Thursday, a day after the racial slurs were found in boys’ bathrooms in Parkway Central and Parkway North. District spokeswoman Cathy Kelly said officials were close to finding the person who wrote the graffiti at Parkway North. School officials do not believe the incidents are related.\n\nMontana\n\nBig Sky: Authorities said unauthorized drone flights over a Montana wildfire prevented firefighting aircraft from being used against the blaze burning in rugged terrain south of Big Sky. Custer Gallatin National Forest officials said the fire in the drainage for Upper Taylor Fork creek grew to more than 70 acres by Wednesday. Drones over the area forced officials to ground aircraft for safety twice since the fire was first reported Monday afternoon, forest spokesperson Marna Daley said. The lack of air support meant crews on the ground had to take a less direct approach to suppressing the fire, which allowed it to grow. About 40 personnel were working on the fire with more due to arrive.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A four-month police operation targeting gang activity in Omaha and surrounding communities led to more than 230 arrests and the seizure of dozens of guns and more than $800,000 worth of illegal narcotics, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The service said in a news release Tuesday that Operation Triple Beam/Operation K.O. was conducted from May through August and was led by the U.S. Marshals Service’s Metro Fugitive Task Force and the Omaha and Lincoln police departments. In addition to 231 arrests, officers seized 86 guns, about 42 pounds of narcotics worth nearly $822,000, more than 800 fentanyl pills and about $49,000 in cash, according to the release. Officers also found three missing children and recovered two stolen vehicles. The operation was part of a national effort developed by the Marshals Service to reduce gang violence by arresting violent fugitives, gang members and those who have committed violent crimes.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge dismissed a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Evel Knievel’s son a year ago against the Walt Disney Co. and movie company Pixar over a “Toy Story 4” daredevil character named Duke Caboom. “We’re obviously disappointed,” Kelly Knievel said in a Monday email. “We are considering our options” at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. U.S. District Judge James Mahan in Las Vegas dismissed the case against Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on Sept. 23. The judge wrote that although the Caboom character was “reminiscent” of Knievel, “Disney’s use of Evel Knievel’s likeness contains significant transformative elements” and is not a literal depiction. An email message from The Walt Disney Co. spokesman Jeffrey R. Epstein said he was traveling and unavailable for immediate comment. Kelly Knievel, head of Las Vegas-based K and K Promotions, had characterized the Caboom character as “a direct knock-off of the legend and historical significance” of Knievel’s father, the famous stunt motorcyclist who died in 2007 at 69 in Florida of lung disease. The lawsuit filed in September 2020 accused Disney and Pixar of intentionally modeling the “Toy Story 4” character on Knievel, whose stunts included motorcycle jumps in 1967 over the Caesars Palace fountain in Las Vegas – including a spectacular near-fatal crash – and in 1975 over a row of buses at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Angry opponents of the Biden administration’s new vaccine mandate forced the postponement of Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting, further delaying a vote on $27 million in federal aid to boost New Hampshire’s vaccination efforts. The Republican-controlled council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts and nominations to courts and agencies, had voted this month to table a request from the state Department of Health and Human Services to spend federal pandemic relief money on a public health program manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccine and address public concerns about it. Republican lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which also must approve the request, have done the same. The request was back before the council on Wednesday, but the meeting in Manchester was called off after protesters moved around the room, shouting, “Shut it down,” according to video shared by WMUR-TV. After Councilor David Wheeler said state employees attending to answer questions about agenda items were in fear for the lives, one man shouted, “Mission accomplished!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: A company that has received preliminary approval to build a wind farm off the southern coast of New Jersey is planning a second project. Atlantic Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables North America and Shell New Energies US, already has approval from New Jersey regulators to build a wind farm about 8.7 miles off the coast. But in a construction plan filed with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Atlantic Shores revealed it is planning a second such project, one it has not publicly announced. That project could be considered in the next round of offshore wind project solicitations by New Jersey regulators in the third quarter of 2022. “Atlantic Shores’ second project, Project 2 … is being developed to support these future New Jersey solicitations,” the company wrote in its filing. The company has not said how many megawatts of power the second project might provide. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico students will take the SAT in spring 2022 as the state phases in a pandemic-delayed testing requirement aimed at increasing participation that varies widely by racial and ethnic groups. Those disparities were stark this spring as high school students were offered the test but didn’t have to take it. There were deep differences in high school juniors’ participation according to racial and ethnic groups, with particularly low totals among Indigenous students, data released by New Mexico’s education department showed. The state had planned to require high school juniors to take the English and Math exams this spring, replacing previous statewide assessments. About a dozen states including Ohio and New Jersey require students to take the SAT or list it as one of the options to fulfill federal requirements for standardized testing. But the pandemic made it harder for students nationwide to take the SAT. Logistical complications from the virus spurred New Mexico to get a waiver from federal testing requirements. Exactly 25% of eligible high school juniors took the test this spring in New Mexico, according to data released by the state’s Public Education Department this week. The rate was far lower for Indigenous students, with only 11% of high school juniors in that group taking the test.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The hit Broadway show “Aladdin” was canceled Wednesday night when breakthrough COVID-19 cases were reported within the musical’s company, a day after the show reopened following 18 months of being shuttered by the pandemic. It was a worrying sign for Broadway’s recovery. “Through our rigorous testing protocols, breakthrough COVID-19 cases have been detected within the company of ‘Aladdin’ at the New Amsterdam Theatre,” the show announced on social media. “Because the wellness and safety of our guests, cast and crew are our top priority, tonight’s performance, Wednesday, Sept. 29 , is canceled.” It was the first Broadway COVID-19 cancellation since shows resumed with Bruce Springsteen’s concert returning in July and “Pass Over” as the first play to debut in August. “Aladdin” said the status of future performances “will be updated.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Entertainer Nick Cannon is promising to pay off the loan debt of seven students at historically black colleges, including three in North Carolina, when they graduate. Cannon played host to students from Saint Augustine’s University, North Carolina A&T State University, Winston-Salem State University and other HBCUs on his nationally syndicated talk show Monday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. They spoke about the adversity they faced and their desire to attend college, particularly an HBCU. Cannon then told the students their outstanding college debt would be paid off when they graduate through a scholarship in partnership with the United Negro College Fund and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. He is an alumnus of Howard University, an HBCU in the District of Columbia. Mackenzie Estrep, a senior at Saint Augustine’s University, is a first-generation high school graduate and college student who is working three jobs to help pay for tuition. Sharandica Midcalf, a student at Winston-Salem State University, was homeless and said a school counselor told her she didn’t have the grade-point average to get into college, which motivated her to succeed as a first-generation college student. Christian Kornegay talked about how he overcame a learning disability and got accepted to North Carolina A&T University, where he’s working to become a professional host and entertainer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A cold front moving through the region has eased record-breaking heat this week in North Dakota. According to the National Weather Service, Tuesday’s reading of 100 in Dickinson appeared to be the latest in the year that the state has recorded a triple-digit temperature. The temperature in Dickson was 2 degrees higher that the city’s previous record, set in 1905. Bismarck also had a record high Tuesday of 98 degrees, 1 degree higher than the city’s 1905 record for the date. Hot weather also covered eastern North Dakota. Grand Forks eclipsed its century-old record with a high of 91 degrees, the Bismarck Tribune reported. A cold front returned temperatures in the region to more seasonable levels Wednesday with readings in the 50s, 60s and 70s. The latest drought briefing from the weather service said “October is favored for continued above-average temperatures” across the state.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Ohio's minimum wage will increase from $8.80 to $9.30 an hour for nontipped employees next year because of inflation. The minimum wage for tipped employees will increase from $4.40 to $4.65. The changes take effect Jan. 1 and apply to employees of businesses with annual gross receipts of more than $342,000 a year. A 2006 constitutional amendment ties annual increases in the rate to inflation. The Consumer Price Index increased by 5.8% over the 12-month period from Sept. 1, 2020 to Aug. 31. Next year's 50-cent increase is the largest in one year increase since the amendment raised the rate from $4.25 to $6.85 in 2007. For employees at smaller companies and 14- and 15-year-olds, the state minimum wage is the same as the federal wage, $7.25 an hour. Ohio is one of 18 states that makes automatic adjustments to the state minimum wage. Democrat-backed bills to raise the state wage to $15 per hour have failed to pass the GOP-controlled General Assembly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation said it has reached 400,000 tribal citizens and expects to become the most populous indigenous tribe in the United States again. “In the coming months, Cherokee Nation Registration will be adding thousands more tribal citizens whose applications are already pending and awaiting verification, making the Cherokee Nation the largest tribe in the United States,” Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement. In March, the Arizona-based Navajo Nation announced that it had become the nation’s most populous tribe when it reached a population of nearly 400,000 to surpass the Cherokee Nation, which then had about 392,000 citizens. However, the Cherokee Nation’s registration department has received up to 2,000 citizenship applications weekly since Hoskin announced a $2,000 COVID-19 assistance payment to all citizens and those approved as citizens by June 2022, according to the tribe. The applications for citizenship increased 10-fold from before the payment announcement, according to the tribe. Navajos also saw an enrollment increase as the tribe offered hardship assistance payments from last year’s federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, boosting the tribe’s rolls from about 306,000 to nearly 400,000 citizens.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board that acted last month to ban educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols has broadened the policy to prohibit district employees from displaying all types of political symbols. The move by the Newberg School Board last month to keep staff from displaying BLM or gay pride flags prompted strong criticism and threats to boycott the town of about 25,000 people southwest of Portland and its businesses. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported the board rescinded that rule Tuesday night and enacted a more sweeping policy banning any kind of political symbols, including those that support BLM or LGBTQ issues. “We need to get moving back toward education,” said Board Chair Dave Brown, who joined the majority in the 4-3 vote approving the new policy. “We’ve been derailed for quite a while.” The board’s initial move last month generated a backlash from Newberg city councilors and members of color of the Oregon Legislature. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. Newberg School Board Vice Chair Brian Shannon said after Tuesday’s vote that it was time to move on. “This policy is so innocuous. It just says that teachers can’t display political symbols at work while they’re on school time,’ Shannon said. “I don’t want to spend five, six more minutes on this issue, let alone six more weeks.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is mailing 375,000 holders of commercial driver’s licenses in a recruitment campaign meant to address a shortage of school bus drivers. The state has a little more than 42,000 school bus drivers, the smallest complement in five years and about 2,000 fewer than in 2017. The Department of Transportation will mail all current CDL holders about the need for bus drivers and inform them how they can get the right endorsement to operate a school bus, said Kurt Myers, PennDOT’s deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services. The state is hoping to address the shortage by appealing to drivers looking for work or seeking to supplement their income. “We want to do everything we possibly can to expand the number of individuals with school bus endorsements to be able to get our children to school. That’s the critical part of all of this,” Myers said. Schools across the nation are facing driver shortages, and many Pennsylvania districts are impacted, Myers said. PennDOT will also temporarily offer another day of CDL skills testing per week. The additional testing days will be held on Mondays for four consecutive weeks beginning Oct. 18.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport:Gustave White Sotheby's International Realty announced the sale of the 30,982-square-foot Miramar mansion at 646 Bellevue Ave., but did not include a sale price. The buyer was unrepresented by an agent, the release said. The property last sold in 2006 for $17.5 million, which at the time was the highest price paid for a single-family home in the city and perhaps in the state, according to a report in The Daily News. According to records in the Newport assessor's office, the estate consists of three properties – the mansion, a carriage house and a separate, vacant 1-acre oceanfront lot – on 7.2 acres of land. Streetcar magnate George Dunton Widener of Philadelphia commissioned noted architect Horace Trumbauer in the early 1900s to build his family a summer home in Newport. During the planning, Widener and his wife, Eleanor, and their son, Harry Elkins Widener, traveled to Europe. On the return trip, in 1912, the father and son went down with the Titanic, but Eleanor Widener survived. She later married Alexander Hamilton Jr., a Harvard professor and grandson of a Massachusetts governor, and completed Miramar in 1913-14. Miramar is the latest in Newport mansions to be sold. Clarendon Court, the former home of Claus and Sunny von Bulow at 626 Bellevue Ave., went earlier this month for $30 million, and Seaward estate at 339 Ocean Avenue was subdivided before being sold for $16 million.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A man in a standoff with police shot and injured a police dog who bit him as officers tried to take him into custody, investigators said. The standoff at a Greenville home continued for a few more hours before Anthony Shay Hawthorne was arrested, Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said in a statement Thursday. The dog, named Nikos, was shot in a paw and the head, but should recover. Lewis said. Hawthorne, 44, was taken to a hospital to be treated for the dog bite and is charged with attempted murder, cruelty to a police dog and possession of a weapon during a violent crime, investigators said. The standoff started about 7 p.m. Wednesday when Hawthorne shot at his mother, then barricaded himself in his home, officials said. The police dog was shot when its handler sent it in to try and take Hawthorne into custody, Lewis said. A SWAT team entered the house about 8 hours after the standoff started and took Hawthorne into custody without any further problems, the sheriff said. Lewis praised the work of emergency veterinarians in treating the police dog. “The resiliency of Nikos in these early stages of this incident has been incredible and we are certainly pulling for him as he begins the process for recovery,” the sheriff said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem is again applying to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day. The Department of Tourism submitted its application for a special use permit to the National Parks Service on Wednesday on behalf of Noem for fireworks next year. The Parks Service in March denied the state’s application for a fireworks display this year, citing safety concerns. South Dakota had been dealing with drought and wildfires that burned within the monument’s boundaries earlier this year, forcing the park to close for several days. Noem argued that if the fireworks were allowed, conditions would be monitored and organizers could cancel the show if the fire risk was too great. Local Native American tribes also opposed holding the celebration on land they hold as sacred and were concerned about the spread of COVID-19. Noem is in litigation with the U.S. Department of Interior over that rejection. “Despite their arbitrary decision to cancel the 2021 Fireworks Celebration, the Biden Administration has an opportunity to work with us to celebrate next year and for the years to come,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Noem successfully pushed for a return of the event in 2019 after a decadelong hiatus. It gave former President Donald Trump an opportunity to be featured in a patriotic display attended by thousands of people during the pandemic.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:A Knoxville special education teacher died from COVID-19, a medical examiner’s report has confirmed. Kelle Grady died Sept. 8 at the age of 48, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. She was a teacher at A.L. Lotts Elementary School. Her obituary called her a “devoted teacher.” Grady died the same day as Knox County Schools bus driver Tammy Murphy, who was ill with COVID-19 for weeks and had been put on a ventilator. The Knox County Board of Education had declined to approve a mask mandate, but on Sept. 24, a federal judge ruled that Knox County Schools must implement masking to help protect children with health problems amid the pandemic. The same ruling also blocked an August executive order by Gov. Bill Lee allowing families to opt out of school mask mandates. It was one of three rulings blocking implementation of Lee’s executive order. The other two affect Williamson and Shelby counties.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Three firefighters remained in critical condition after an explosion at an apartment complex in Dallas, authorities said. The blast happened Wednesday morning at the apartment complex where the firefighters were responding to a reported natural gas leak. A two-story building partially collapsed, and four firefighters and four civilians were injured. Dallas-Fire Rescue said late Wednesday that all four civilians were released from a hospital along with one of the firefighters. The building where the explosion occurred had 10 units and all of the residents were accounted for, authorities said. The structure was torn down later Wednesday because of safety issues and an investigation into the cause of the blast was ongoing. Dallas-Fire Rescue said natural gas was shut off for the entire complex because of the investigation and that displaced about 300 people. All buildings will be inspected in the complex before the residents return.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Because of a cold front, a lot of the smoke from a wildfire in the Sequoia National Park is moving to Utah and becoming trapped in the atmosphere above the state's southwestern corner, said National Weather Service meteorologist, Mike Wessler. The forecast suggested winds on Tuesday night could help move some of that smoke toward Colorado, Wessler said, although at least some would stick around longer into the week. Western wildfires sent smoke into Utah throughout the summer, with the local air quality approaching dangerous levels in some places. The latest large set of fires is the KNP Complex, which is threatening Sequoia National Park, home to a forest of giant sequoias, the largest trees in the world, according to the National Park Service website. The giant sequoias, which grow along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, can be as old as 3,400 years.\n\nVermont\n\nMarlboro: A Vermont music venue, Marlboro Music, has bought the college campus where it resides after 70 years without claim to the property. The president and chair of Marlboro Music, Christopher Serkin, said Tuesday that the purchase of the former Marlboro College was in its last stages. According to documents submitted to the town, Marlboro Music subsidiary Potash Hill paid $2.7 million to the college’s owner, Democracy Builders Fund 1, The Brattleboro Reformer reported. Serkin said Marlboro Music will continue its use of the campus for three months in the summer. It will also develop a process to determine the use of the now-empty college campus for the rest of the year. Before its closure, Marlboro College struggled to keep its doors open as enrollment dwindled and revenue dropped, the newspaper reported. In 2019, Marlboro College merged with Emerson College and closed its main campus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An enormous statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was cut into pieces and hauled away from Richmond’s Monument Avenue three weeks ago, but plaintiffs who failed to block the removal want Virginia’s Supreme Court to reconsider its decision allowing it. Four property owners filed a request Wednesday with the high court for a rehearing, alleging the justices made “several fundamental errors” in their Sept. 2 decision, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The unanimous ruling observed that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The court cited testimony from historians who said the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. Restoring the monument would be ideal for the plaintiffs, but attorney Patrick M. McSweeney said his clients “don’t think the state owns and controls the monument.” The state wants to keep the monument and land while disavowing promises made to obtain them. “Such a result allows the Commonwealth to take property without compensation,” the petition states.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:A 24-year-old North Kitsap man was charged with assault after biting off another man’s thumb during a fight that started as a group of friends were heading to a bar. The victim, 27, wrote in a statement included in Kitsap County Superior Court charging documents that he and the suspect were not getting along in the lead-up to the fight the night of Sept. 2, the Kitsap Sun reported. The victim said the suspect attacked him after he criticized him for being lazy before going into the bar. While on the ground, the victim said he tried to push the man’s face away but his left thumb went into the suspect’s mouth and he bite down. The suspect “continued to bite my thumb until he bit off the end,” the victim wrote. Medics collected the thumb from the roadway and they went to a hospital. The suspect told deputies that the victim turned the verbal argument into a fight by kicking him in the chest and that he “did not bite down very hard,” a deputy wrote. The victim had surgery but lost function from the first knuckle and permanently lost the tip of his thumb. The suspect was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s largest outdoor festival on the third-highest U.S. bridge next month was canceled Wednesday, a week after a group representing parachutists bailed out. The Bridge Day Commission voted unanimously to cancel the Oct. 16 event on the New River Gorge Bridge. Marcus Ellison, an organizer for a group of BASE jumpers, cited concerns about available health care in case of an emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic in announcing last week that the group would not participate. Some hospitals in southern West Virginia have been inundated in recent weeks with COVID-19 patients, with a few saying their intensive care units were at capacity. Ellison also was concerned there could be an insufficient number of bus drivers to transport BASE jumpers from the bottom to the top of the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville on Oct. 16. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and Earth, the fixed objects from which jumpers leap.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFond Du Lac: Hundreds of people packed a Fond du Lac church to pay respects to police officer Joseph Kurer, 26, who died of coronavirus complications. Kurer died Sept. 22, just a day after his wife gave birth to their second child. At Holy Family Catholic Church, Kurer was remembered Wednesday as a servant and champion of justice. “We’re hurting. It’s not easy, we’re hurting. But we’ll make it through it. We’ll lean on each other and come through,” said Fond du Lac Police Lt. Erik Foster. Kurer also served in the Wisconsin National Guard and because of that, he received full military honors. A pair of Black Hawk helicopters flew over the crowd of mourners outside of the church following the funeral, WBAY-TV reported A long line of squad cars from law enforcement agencies across the state joined the procession as Kurer was taken past the police department one last time. Citizens lined the street to pay their respects to the officer and his family. The police department said Kurer contracted COVID-19 while working, so his death is classified as in the line of duty.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The vaccine hesitancy in Gillette is emblematic of the live-free, mind-your-own-business mentality toward the pandemic that is dominant across conservative America at a time when the delta variant of the coronavirus is tearing through unvaccinated communities. For every 100 people spotted around town in Gillette, the number wearing masks can be counted on one hand. Among a group of six people on a smoke break downtown, all said they had too many concerns about the vaccine to mess with it. Down the street, a black shirt displayed in a storefront warned, “ATTENTION SNOWFLAKES: THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE.” Wyoming is the second-least vaccinated state as of Tuesday, behind only West Virginia. Only 23% of residents in Campbell County, where Gillette is, have been vaccinated, putting it among the bottom handful of places in the U.S.that have not cracked 25% with their COVID-19 immunization rates. People bristle at the workplace vaccine mandate being pushed by President Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/23/ai-hiring-bias-dog-bone-beating-searchable-museum-news-around-states/49425693/", "title": "AI hiring bias, dog bone beating: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Leaders of several American Indian tribes are asking the University of Alabama to return nearly 6,000 human remains and artifacts from the school’s archaeological park and museum. The Oklahoma-based Muscogee Nation has tried for six years to get the remains back, but bureaucratic red tape has slowed the effort, said RaeLynn Butler, the Muscogee Nation’s historic and cultural preservation manager. The situation is no different than if someone dug up a family graveyard and took the remains for study, said Del Beaver, second chief of the Muscogee Nation. “And then if somebody asked for their grandma back, and we said, ‘No, there’s too much red tape,’ ” Beaver told the news site Al.com. “Just give us our people back.” Communications with the university slowed during the pandemic, frustrating tribal leaders who believe the remains and artifacts at the university’s Moundville Archaeological Park should be reburied, Butler said. This week, a federal review committee is scheduled to consider the evidence linking the seven tribes to Moundville and will rule on whether they can claim the remains as their own. However, the committee can’t force the university to turn over the remains and artifacts, Butler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is extending through May a timeline to decide how or whether to proceed with proposed restrictions on mining in the state’s Bristol Bay region, known for its salmon runs. Acting Regional Administrator Michelle L. Pirzadeh, in a written notice, said an extension through May would allow time “to consider available information in order to determine appropriate next steps, which may include revising” restrictions that were proposed but never finalized under the Obama administration. The EPA, as part of a 2017 settlement with the developer of the proposed Pebble Mine, agreed to initiate a process to suggest withdrawing the proposed restrictions. The developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, cast the proposed restrictions as an attempt to preemptively veto the copper and gold mine and said it wanted the project vetted through the permitting process. The company subsequently filed a permit application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the EPA withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine.” That action was challenged in court, and the EPA earlier this year asked a judge to vacate the withdrawal decision and send the matter back to the agency for further consideration. The request was granted.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A union representing the largest group of food service workers at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport went on strike Monday, during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, to amplify concerns about wages, health insurance and retirement contributions. HMS Host is the single largest concessionaire at the airport in Phoenix that served more than 45 million passengers annually before the coronavirus pandemic. Workers with UNITE HERE Local 11 voted overwhelmingly last week to go on strike. The strike won’t affect flights but will affect hungry travelers because HMS operates more than two dozen restaurants and coffee shops. The company said in a statement that it will offer prepackaged food and scale down offerings for sit-down service during the strike. Four years of negotiations on a contract have failed, the labor union said in a statement. Workers are seeking raises, affordable health insurance, a company-paid retirement contribution and protection from discrimination, according to union officials. HMS Host said it offered substantial wage increases and benefits that include paying 90% of employees’ health care costs. The union represents less than half of the company’s hourly employees, HMS Host said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A lawsuit settlement has prompted the Arkansas State Police to clarify when troopers can try to slow a fleeing vehicle by striking it with a patrol car. Between 2016 and 2020, use of the tactic – which is intended to cause the fleeing vehicle to spin out of control – has increased every year, according to data provided by state police, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The tactic came under scrutiny after a July 9, 2020, incident in which state Trooper Rodney K. Dunn tried to stop Janice Nicole Harper for speeding as she drove in Pulaski County. Denton and Zachary PLLC, the law firm representing Harper, say she was looking for a safe place to pull over on the strip of highway that was lined with concrete barriers when Dunn used the maneuver, known as precision immobilization technique, or PIT, and caused Harper’s car to flip over. State police reached a preliminary settlement with Harper on Friday. Due to the settlement, state police clarified their use-of-force policy, instructing troopers to judge whether using the technique is “objectively reasonable,” Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler told the newspaper. Since 2018, at least 1 in 4 pursuits has ended with a PIT maneuver, and police and officials have defended its continued use.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: During a visit Saturday to Alcatraz Island, which became a symbol of the struggles of Native Americans for self-determination following its takeover in the 1960s, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said progress has been made by Indigenous people, but more remains to be done. Haaland visited the island off San Francisco’s coast on the 52nd anniversary of the occupation by Indigenous students who were demanding that the U.S. government recognize long-standing agreements with tribes and turn over the deed to the island. The group was removed after a 19-month occupation, but the takeover became a watershed moment in Native American activism. “Alcatraz was borne out of desperation,” said Haaland, accompanied by some of the dozens of people who occupied the island in 1969. “Out of this we gained a sense of community and visibility in the eyes of the federal government. But more than that, our Indigenous identities were restored.” Haaland, who is from Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico and the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency, said that thanks to the actions of those activists, Native Americans no longer have to resort to extreme measures to be heard. “The fact that I’m standing here today is a testament to that fact,” she said. “I am here. We are here. And we are not going anywhere.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Coloradans with COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness will no longer need a doctor’s referral before getting antibody treatments designed to keep them out of hospitals, starting this week. Gov. Jared Polis made the announcement expanding access to monoclonal antibodies Friday, the Denver Post reports. Colorado’s hospitals have been stressed by high COVID-19 caseloads, and 2 in every 5 hospitals reporting to the state expected to be short on intensive care beds within the next week. Roughly 45% of hospitals said they were experiencing staff shortages. About 1 in every 62 Colorado residents is currently infected with the coronavirus. Still, the governor has resisted reinstating public health measures such as mask mandates or capacity limits on businesses, despite calls from local public health officials to take more aggressive action. On Monday, the health departments representing Jefferson, Adams and Arapahoe counties – which have lobbied Polis to issue a new mask mandate for public indoor spaces – planned to consider enacting their own. Public health experts warn coronavirus cases could climb as people gather together during the holiday season. In Colorado Springs, public defenders are working remotely after employees in the office were sent home amid a possible COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Already facing higher fuel and salt prices, the state is looking for snowplow drivers to fill a shortage as winter approaches. The Connecticut Department of Transportation is seeking to hire nearly 140 more drivers to address a 13% driver shortage, The Day reports. DOT spokesperson Kafi Rouse told the newspaper the shortage is due to a recent spate of retirements and a shortage of applicants who have commercial driver’s licenses. It can be difficult to recruit snowplow drivers because of unpredictable scheduling, Rouse said. Kurt Hayes, owner of Hayes Services, a snow removal service in East Lyme, told The Day he has reduced his customer list due to supply shortages for snowplow parts. Fuel prices have doubled, and salt prices are up about 30%, said Rick Whittle, owner of Allied Snow Plowing Removal in Mystic. Whittle told the newspaper he has had to raise his prices by up to 15%. “Sometimes it can snow three times in a week, so it’s unpredictable to everyone involved, from the salt guy to the plow guy to everyone,” Whittle said. “That’s what makes it hard.”\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: A blast heard throughout northern Delaware on Sunday was the result of an exploding rifle target that destroyed a nearby abandoned car, according to the State Fire Marshal’s Office. The explosion near Middletown was reported shortly before noon in a farm field several hundred yards away from the main roadway in the 4700 block of Summit Bridge Road, officials said. No injuries have been reported. Prior to the explosion, several people gathered in the field for target practice with firearms until an explosive mixture, known as a “binary exploding rifle target,” was placed next to the abandoned vehicle. A long-range rifle detonated the target, leading to the vehicle being destroyed and fragments being scattered across almost 3 acres of farmland, officials said. The explosion sent shockwaves through social media as residents reported hearing a loud boom as far away as Newark and Bear. Numerous commenters also reported their houses shaking due to the explosion. Investigators canvassed the area to see if any property had been damaged as a result of the “misuse” of the target, officials said. The Delaware State Police Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit also assisted with destroying materials.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture has welcomed millions of visitors through its doors since opening in 2016. Now, millions more can visit with the tap of a button, WUSA-TV reports. The museum launched its latest digital initiative, the Searchable Museum, on Thursday. The digital platform at searchablemuseum.com is aimed at capturing the in-house experience of the museum for anyone with access to a laptop, smartphone or other digital device. “This ongoing project provides a chance for Americans to realize our shared past, bringing the unique museum experience to their homes and on their phones,” said museum director Kevin Young. The digital project’s first exhibition, “Slavery and Freedom,” is based on an exhibition of the same name in the museum’s David M. Rubenstein History Galleries. Users will virtually experience recreations of striking moments from the gallery exhibition, including the History Elevator, which transports visitors back in time from the present to the early 1400s through images accompanied by the words of Maya Angelou. The Paradox of Liberty depicts Thomas Jefferson, U.S. president and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, surrounded by the names of the 609 people he enslaved over his lifetime.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A judge on Monday officially exonerated four young African American teens and men of the false accusation that they raped a white woman seven decades ago, making partial and belated amends for one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of Florida’s Jim Crow era. At the request of the local prosecutor, Administrative Judge Heidi Davis dismissed the indictments of Ernest Thomas and Samuel Shepherd, who were fatally shot by law enforcement, and set aside the convictions and sentences of Charles Greenlee and Walter Irvin. The Groveland Four, who ranged from 16 to 26 years old at the time, were accused of raping a woman in 1949. “We followed the evidence to see where it led us, and it led us to this moment,” said Bill Gladson, the local state attorney, following the hearing in the same Lake County courthouse where the original trials were held. Gladson, a Republican, moved last month to have the men exonerated. The men’s families said maybe this case will spark a reexamination of other convictions of Black men and women from the Jim Crow era. “We are blessed. I hope that this is a start because lot of people didn’t get this opportunity,” said Aaron Newson, Thomas’ nephew. He broke into tears as he spoke. “This country needs to come together.” Thomas was killed by a posse that shot him more than 400 times shortly after the rape accusation. The local sheriff, Willis McCall, fatally shot Shepherd and wounded Irvin in 1951 as he drove them to a second trial after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned their first convictions, saying no evidence had been presented. The sheriff claimed the men tried to escape, but Irvin said McCall and his deputy shot them in cold blood.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A newly launched program aims to provide people experiencing homelessness work for pay while also cleaning the city. “One of the things I think people can all come to common ground on is if some of the homeless are willing to work for these couple of hours, then that’s a win for everybody,” said James Scott, executive director of Sparrow’s Nest, a Christian ministry serving those in need. “It’s a win-win. A win for them, and also for the community in keeping Athens safe and clean.” Currently, the initiative pays members of the homeless community $10 an hour for about two hours once a week. It typically opens to the first 10 people to arrive at Sparrow’s Nest. Scott said the program has been running for more than a month, with hopes to expand it. “We want to increase it to two to three hours, or two to three times a week, or three to four hours, either-or, to be able to give people opportunity,” he said. Through expanding the program, Scott said, there’s hope that it can lead to building leadership and additional opportunities for participants. “My long-term hope is that we can begin to, because I’m in ministry, make disciples,” he said. “The guy who is picking up today, hopefully, he can be the guy when we move to 20 to be over a group of people.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Some people on Maui want to limit bike tours they say create safety hazards, but company owners worry new restrictions would hurt business. Maui County Council Member Mike Molina introduced a bill last week to limit the times and number of people who could go on guided bike tours, The Maui News reports. Among the proposed rules is a ban on unguided tours and a requirement that guided tours operate only between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The measure would also limit riders to 10 per group and cap the number of companies that can operate in certain districts to six. Jeremy Hall, co-owner of Haleakala Bike Company, said the proposal goes against small businesses and is anti-tourism. “We’re not some mainland company that’s popped up and is taking money out of the community, using public resources – we’re people who live Upcountry. My employees live Upcountry,” said Hall, whose business has been operating on Maui for 30 years. Some residents said the tours create traffic hazards. “These roadways were not built for bikes; these roadways are even risky for residents who live here,” said Haiku resident Jasmine Kilborn. “Visitors don’t know the area. They don’t know the road or what they’re getting themselves into.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Most of the state’s emergency medical services rely entirely on volunteers and don’t have enough resources to meet the needs of their communities, according to a new report from the Office of Performance Evaluations. Just 18% of EMS directors reported that their agency is able to maintain sufficient staff, according to the report released Friday, and 65% said they experienced delayed emergency response times because of staffing problems within the past year. Under state law, emergency medical services aren’t considered “essential,” so there is no guarantee that every community will have access to ambulances or paramedics in an emergency. Across Idaho, EMS programs are run by a variety of entities – including private organizations, fire departments, local governments and other groups – using a patchwork of funding. In rural Idaho, nearly 7 out of 10 EMS providers are volunteers. “Agency officials we interviewed consistently reported that not every Idahoan gets the level of care they need during an emergency. They cited insufficient staffing as the primary reason,” the Office of Performance Evaluation staffers wrote in the report. A 2010 report from the Office of Performance Evaluations found similar problems, but lawmakers didn’t follow through on many of the things the office recommended to address the issues.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state wants the public’s help to return nearly a dozen Purple Heart medals to their rightful owners. The medals are awarded to members of the U.S. military who are injured or killed while serving. Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs said the 11 medals each were left in a bank safe deposit box that went untouched for years. The treasurer’s office received them as part of the office’s unclaimed property program after the owners could not be found. “These medals personify honor, sacrifice and duty,” Frerichs said. “They belong in the loving care of families rather than hidden inside our cold basement vault.” His office released a list Thursday of the last names associated with the safe deposit box, the date in which the medal was recorded with the state treasurer’s office and the location of the bank. They include multiple banks across Illinois and one in Portland, Oregon. Frerichs asked anyone who may have a lead on locating a veteran or his or her family to contact his office.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Hundreds of onlookers gathered Sunday morning to watch as a series of blasts brought down an 18-story office tower that had been the city’s tallest building for than a half-century. Crowds watching from a safe distance cheered as a cloud of smoke enveloped part of downtown Evansville after a rapid series of blasts collapsed the 420 Main Building in less than a half-minute. The office tower had housed Old National Bank’s headquarters from 1970 to 2004. But after the bank moved out, the tower’s occupancy dropped, its condition deteriorated, and efforts to rehabilitate it failed. Neil Chapman’s law firm was the building’s last tenant. He hosted a party Sunday morning to watch the implosion from his new office in the Fifth Third Center, which at 15 stories is now the tallest structure in the southwestern Indiana city, along the Ohio River. “This was a man-made structure, 18 stories tall, and to see it come down suddenly and violently within seconds is amazing. It brings out your inner 8-year-old,” Chapman said. Contractors said most of the 18,000 tons of rubble left will be crushed and reused in the site’s redevelopment. The implosion makes way for a planned retail and apartment development that will top out at four stories. Property owner Domo is leading that endeavor, called Fifth & Main.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials say they will continue to strive for fewer than 300 annual traffic deaths, but it won’t happen in 2021. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports that as of Friday, Iowa’s traffic death count stood at 312. Iowa Department of Transportation officials say that outpaces the death toll for the same date in the four previous years, but it was below the 350 count by the same time in 2016 – the last year highway crashes claimed more than 400 lives. Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau Chief Brett Tjepkes said a safety campaign will continue to urge drivers to slow down, buckle up, drive sober and remain distraction-free heading into the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period. State officials cite speeding as a major problem, and the state patrol has been cracking down, issuing more than twice as many tickets in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Conservative legislators struggled Monday to build support among Republicans for a proposal to provide unemployment benefits to workers who lose their jobs for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The GOP-controlled Legislature opened a special session Monday. The measure on unemployment benefits was tied to another that would make it easier for workers to claim religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Both are responses to mandates from President Joe Biden covering more than 100 million American workers. The push for unemployment benefits for vaccine-refusing workers comes after GOP lawmakers worried for months that the depletion of funds to pay claims last year during the pandemic would force an increase in the state tax that finances the benefits. There’s bipartisan concern that the unemployment proposal before lawmakers now could lead to such a tax increase. “Most of our employers are small businesses. That increase in taxes, on unemployment, will be difficult,” state Sen. Jeff Longbine, of Emporia, told fellow Republicans during a meeting Monday before the session convened.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The chemical giant Chemours, moving to cut emissions of a climate super-pollutant from its facility in the Rubbertown neighborhood, has asked city officials to issue a permit for new abatement equipment that could release chloroform and other hazardous air pollutants. The company plans to capture the climate super-pollutant hydrofluorocarbon-23 and transport the gas to a Chemours plant in West Virginia for destruction. As part of the process to capture HFC-23, about 1,600 pounds a year of chloroform, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and hydrogen fluoride, all hazardous air pollutants, could be emitted into neighborhoods around its Louisville facility. While not a local air pollutant, HFC-23 is one of the most potent greenhouse gases warming the planet. The chemical byproduct is 14,600 times more potent for warming of the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change. Chemours and Louisville officials say the net effect of the abatement project will be a major reduction in greenhouse gases blamed for heating the planet and a plantwide reduction in hazardous air contaminants – even though the proposed construction permit shows a chloroform tank and other new equipment could result in the release of those air pollutants.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The director of New Orleans Emergency Medical Services is resigning after more than three years in the job, a spokesperson for the struggling agency said Friday. Dr. Emily Nichols told her paramedics she was leaving the agency, which has been hit by staffing shortages worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Spokesperson Jonathan Fourcade said Nichols’ departure is expected in the next few weeks. Details about why Nichols quit weren’t immediately available, but Fourcade said she had not been forced out, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Mayor LaToya Cantrell appointed Nichols in May 2018. New Orleans Emergency Medical Services was already dealing with staffing shortages and employee burnout when the pandemic began in 2020. COVID-19 sparked even more shortages, with emergency medical technicians and paramedics either out sick or in quarantine. Many ambulances have also broken down. Recently, with only nine ambulances available from a fleet of 40, Nichols decided to send some paramedics and EMTs home despite the staffing shortfalls, leaving the agency unable to answer some emergency medical calls.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: More hunters are seeing purple as property owners use the color to mark land that is off limits to hunting without first obtaining permission. Purple paint can be used on trees, rocks or fence posts as an alternative to nailing a sign on a tree to let others know that no hunting is allowed without advance permission, said Mark Latti of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. The state’s “purple paint law” has been around since 2011, but it’s being used more and more with each passing year. The marking is a single vertical stripe of purple paint. Hardware stores sell special paint for use in marking properties. According to state law, the signs must be no more than 100 feet apart at locations that are readily visible to people approaching the property, as well as at all vehicular access points off a public road.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Nursing students at the University of Maryland are getting an early jump on their postgraduate careers. The university’s nursing school is allowing its students who are scheduled to graduate Dec. 23 to leave a few weeks early and begin working in the field. The move is motivated by a nursing shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports it’s the fourth time the school has approved such an early-exit program. This time, it was in response to a request from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. All 161 bachelor’s degree students and 11 master’s degree students will leave early during a period that runs from Friday to the first week of December. “Nurses throughout Maryland have served courageously on the front lines for over 20 months,” the school’s dean, Jane Kirschling, said in a statement. “I am proud of our entry-into-practice students for their willingness to support these efforts, and I applaud all of our students for their resiliency and for persevering in their studies during a difficult time marked by uncertainty and ongoing challenges.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First responders would be allowed to treat and transport injured police dogs to veterinary hospitals under a bill unanimously approved by the state Senate. The bill dubbed Nero’s Law was named for the K-9 partner of slain Yarmouth Police Sgt. Sean Gannon. Gannon was fatally shot in 2018 while serving an arrest warrant. Nero was also shot, but because of current state law, EMTs weren’t allowed to treat or transport him. Nero had to be rushed to the animal hospital in the back of a police cruiser and survived the shooting. “K-9 officers protect the men and women in law enforcement as well as the community at large,” said Democratic state Sen. Mark Montigny, lead sponsor of the bill. “These animals endure extreme danger from gun violence, narcotics and even explosive materials. Allowing our emergency personnel to provide basic treatment and transport is a commonsense measure that honors their contributions across the commonwealth.” The bill would permit emergency personnel to treat injured police dogs and bring them to veterinary facilities, as long as there are no injured people still requiring a hospital transport. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House for consideration.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarshall: The last Kmart has closed in the state where the former brick-and-mortar retail giant got its start. Sunday was the last day at a Kmart in Marshall, 100 miles west of Detroit, City Manager Tom Tarkiewicz said Monday. “They still had products they were selling,” Tarkiewicz said. An email seeking comment from Kmart’s corporate parent wasn’t immediately returned. The first Kmart store opened in Garden City, a Detroit suburb, in 1962. The chain grew to more than 2,000 stores across the U.S., but its fortunes changed as other big box retailers gained momentum. Kmart reorganized under bankruptcy protection in 2002-03 and began closing hundreds of stores before merging with Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 2004. Kmart’s website lists 21 stores remaining in the U.S. or U.S. territories. It also sells goods online. Tarkiewicz didn’t know why the Marshall store was the last in Michigan to stay open but said he had heard it was considered to be a profitable location. “It was busy,” he said. “We saw a lot of out-of-state cars. We’re only 36 miles from Indiana.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: About 50 parishioners protested outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church on Sunday over what they say is the eradication of culture and tradition from Minnesota’s first Hispanic parish. Many of the demonstrators were third-generation members of the Roman Catholic church, which has a 90-year history in St. Paul. Among specific complaints, they say Aztec dancers are no longer allowed inside the church, there is no Sunday school or choir, masses previously led in Spanish are now in Latin, and women are not allowed on the altar. One of the protesters, Vincent Mendez, said that “it feels like we’re being forced out again” and that the parishioners “just want to save our church.” The Rev. Michael Tix, with the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement that he and Archbishop Bernard Hebda are involved in conversations between parish leadership and parishioners, the Star Tribune reports. Tix said it is “through open and honest conversation that concerns will best be addressed and solutions reached for the good of everyone involved.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned the approval of a massive flood-control project in the south Mississippi Delta that officials said was erroneously greenlit in the final days of the Trump administration. In a letter to the Army for Civil Works, EPA officials said the past administration’s November 2020 decision to approve the Yazoo Pumps Project was in violation of the Clean Water Act and “failed to reflect the recommendations from the career scientists and technical staff.” Radhika Fox, assistant administrator for the office of water at the EPA, said the federal government is concerned about the serious impacts from flooding on people and the economy of the lower Mississippi Delta. But she said she wants to work with the Corps and others to find “a path forward that addresses flooding concerns in an environmentally protective manner.” The decision was cheered by conservation groups – American Rivers, National Audubon Society, Sierra Club and Healthy Gulf – which had sued the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this year over the construction of pumps in the Yazoo Backwater area north of Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sent a letter demanding a school district return two LGBTQ-themed books to library shelves. The North Kansas City School District pulled “All Boys Aren’t Blue” and “Fun Home” from high schools this month in response to parent complaints, the Kansas City Star reports. The district is reviewing the titles, and the books were expected to be discussed during a Monday school board meeting. In a letter to school officials, the ACLU of Missouri said removing the books violates students’ First Amendment rights by restricting their access to ideas. “Students must be free to access library books – without discrimination or censorship – that are LGBTQ+ affirming as well as books that provide an inclusive and accurate history of racism,” ACLU of Missouri Executive Director Luz María Henríquez said in a statement. Students also are petitioning to have the books returned. “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a coming-of-age memoir about the author’s experience as a queer, Black adolescent. “Fun Home” is about the author’s relationship with her gay father.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A program in the resort community of Big Sky that offers landlords cash to convert vacation rentals or seasonal homes into long-term homes for locals converted 21 homes and housed 58 locals in its first three months. After a three-month trial of the Rent Local program, launched by the Big Sky Community Housing Trust, the nonprofit launched the full program Nov. 1. The success of the pilot program wasn’t a surprise, executive director Laura Seyfang said. “It’s what we were hoping for,” she told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. The program hopes to convince some 1,200 owners of seasonal homes or vacation rentals to rent to local residents by bridging the gap in money the homeowner might make with short-term rentals. The housing trust estimated homeowners make on average anywhere from about $3,800 to about $10,400 more annually on short-term rentals than long-term leases. “By providing this boost, it’s enough to make it even out,” Seyfang said. “We’ve put in place all these ways to make it easier for an owner to rent to a local worker, but then there was that cash difference. By making up that income difference, it takes away all these excuses.” The nonprofit estimates the incentive created new inventory 89% faster than through some of its other programs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A petition drive is underway to change the state’s constitution and eliminate its Board of Education. The proposal would shift oversight of the Education Department into the governor’s office and eliminate the elected board, but backers would have to gather roughly 125,000 signatures by next July to put the question on the November 2022 ballot. The Omaha World-Herald reports the measure comes after Gov. Pete Ricketts clashed with the Education Department at times in the past year. Ricketts spoke out strongly when the state board considered adopting new health education standards for schools that incorporated teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation. The board later abandoned those proposed recommendations for local school districts after it encountered strong opposition. Ricketts said in a statement that any changes to the current structure of the department would have to be approved by voters. “The Nebraska Department of Education should respect that parents are the primary educators of their children, and the agency must continue to be accountable to the people of Nebraska,” Ricketts said. Critics of the petition drive said it would concentrate too much power in the governor’s office and mess up a system that is working.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man has been accused of beating another customer over the head with a dog bone during a quarrel over a pet store’s mask policy, according to authorities. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said 22-year-old Juan Hamilton was arrested on a warrant after the Nov. 8 incident that left the unidentified victim with a skull fracture. Court records show Hamilton was still being held on a $5,000 bond on suspicion of attempted murder, battery, abuse of an older person resulting in substantial bodily harm and burglary of a business. The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reports that witnesses told police Hamilton was in line behind another man when the two began arguing over the PetSmart store’s mask mandate. Witnesses said Hamilton left the store before returning and allegedly beating the victim over the head with a bone. PetSmart employees helped detectives identify Hamilton because he was a regular at the store. Hamilton told police he hadn’t been to the store for several months and then asked for a lawyer. It was unclear Sunday if Hamilton had an attorney who could speak on his behalf about the case. If Hamilton is released from jail, court records indicate he’ll be required to avoid all PetSmart stores.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s bear population is on the move, and officials are asking residents not to detour the animals with snacks. The Fish and Game Department says the public should hold off on putting out bird feeders until December. Right now, bears are searching for high-fat, protein-rich food to sustain them as they head into their dens, and bird feeders are often a target. Andy Timmins, the state bear project leader, said reports of conflicts between bears and people were low this summer, but there has been an uptick in activity since late October, mostly involving bird feeders. He said a single feeding will cause a bear to return in other seasons, leading to property damage and the bears becoming nuisance animals. “Bears have an excellent sense of smell and good memories,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s nine casinos saw their gross operating profit more than double in the third quarter of this year, according to state figures released Monday. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement figures show the casinos posted a collective gross operating profit of more than $310 million in July, August and September. That is more than twice the $151 million profit they reported in the third quarter of 2020, when they were still operating under state-imposed capacity restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that reason, James Plousis, chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the results are not directly comparable. Instead, he compared them to the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic hit, and found the casinos still did nearly 30% better in the third quarter of 2021. “Through efficiencies, every operator posted a profit in the third quarter, a great accomplishment coming out of an extremely challenging period,” he said in a statement. “Atlantic City’s recovery is gaining momentum and is on track for an impressive year.” Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s exports are barreling toward an annual record this year, marking a sharp turnaround from last year’s pandemic-induced slowdown. Total state sales worldwide climbed 55% in the first nine months of 2021, from $2.77 billion in the January-September period last year to $4.28 billion this year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. If those trends continue, the state could well surpass its previous annual export record, reached in 2019, when global sales hit $4.68 billion. In fact, at $4.28 billion as of September, the value of state exports is already more than $1 billion higher than the January-September period in 2019, when sales abroad totaled $3.16 billion. “It’s looking really good,” said Jerry Pacheco, trade consultant and executive director of the International Business Accelerator at Santa Teresa in southern New Mexico. “I expect this to be our biggest year yet,” Pacheco told the Albuquerque Journal. “New Mexico exports are already well exceeding 2019, which was our flagship year before the pandemic.” The coronavirus pandemic markedly slashed exports nationwide in 2020 as consumers hunkered down at home, businesses temporarily shut down across the globe, and supply-chain disruptions slowed commerce worldwide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Job candidates rarely know when hidden artificial intelligence tools are rejecting their resumes or analyzing their video interviews. But New York City residents could soon get more say over the computers making behind-the-scenes decisions about their careers. A bill passed by the City Council this month would ban employers from using automated hiring tools unless a yearly bias audit can show they won’t discriminate based on an applicant’s race or gender. It would also force makers of those AI tools to disclose more about their opaque workings and give candidates the option of choosing an alternative process – such as a human – to review their application. The measure aims to open a window into the complex algorithms that rank the skills and personalities of job applicants based on how they speak or what they write. “I believe this technology is incredibly positive, but it can produce a lot of harms if there isn’t more transparency,” said Frida Polli, co-founder and CEO of New York startup Pymetrics, which uses AI to assess job skills through game-like online assessments. Her company lobbied for the legislation, which favors firms like Pymetrics that already publish fairness audits. But some AI experts and digital rights activists are concerned it doesn’t go far enough to curb bias and implicitly gives the city’s OK to the technology.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A human rights group is suing the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, alleging its staff censors magazines inmates receive by mail, especially those with articles about prison misconduct. Human Rights Defense Center in Florida filed the suit in U.S. District Court, The News & Observer reports. The nonprofit publishes Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, which focus on inmates’ rights, court rulings and other criminal justice issues and circulate to 232 people in state correctional facilities. The group claims that 23 magazine issues or annual reports were banned between 2019 and August. The department’s policy allows material to be kept from offenders because of “threats to institutional safety and security,” but the content can’t reasonably be considered to contain such threats, the lawsuit says. Last month, a contractor began converting prisoners’ letters to digital files, but it doesn’t handle magazines. The nonprofit claims the state violated its free speech and denied access to readers without notice or opportunity to appeal. It argues the department is suppressing its political message and costing subscriptions. It seeks a declaration that such actions are unconstitutional and an end to the practice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The city’s only Democrat in the Legislature won’t run for reelection next year. State Sen. Erin Oban announced Thursday that she won’t be seeking a third term, citing the divisive nature of current politics. The Bismarck Tribune reports her departure opens up one of seven seats held by Senate Democrats, who have dwindled to their smallest minority in 50 years in the Republican-controlled Legislature. “It’s obvious that the extreme rhetoric and divisiveness of the national scene have seeped into our state,” Oban said in a statement. “The North Dakota Senate has been a place that, for the most part, has maintained decorum and respected the rules that govern the way in which we do business. For that, I am grateful. But it was also considered the more ‘serious’ legislative body, the chamber with far less tolerance for distractions, nonsense, and political theater, and over the last few years, that’s been changing.” Oban, 39, is a former junior high math teacher. She was first elected in 2014. Her announcement came a week after Bismarck GOP Sen. Nicole Poolman said she won’t seek reelection. Poolman, an educator, said she wants to spend more time with her family and students but also cited an eroding civility in politics.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Public health officials are asking folks in Greater Columbus to make sure one particular unwanted guest doesn’t crash any Thanksgiving gatherings this year. To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Columbus Public Health is offering free, at-home testing kits from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday in a drive-thru event at the Celeste Center on the Ohio State Fairgrounds. Franklin County residents can get up to 12 home test kits at the event, while supplies last, according to the health department. People are encouraged to test themselves and guests the day of gathering or traveling to someone else’s house. People who test positive should stay home, follow guidance on isolating and notify others with whom they were in close contact, according to the health department. “Testing before you gather adds another layer of protection, especially for those who are at greater risk of serious illness and those too young to get vaccinated,” said Columbus Public Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts. Along with the drive-thru, free at-home tests are available at local libraries and recreation centers, according to a health department release. Thanksgiving approaches as Ohio is seeing yet another rise in COVID-19 cases. Getting vaccinated is “the safest way to celebrate” the holiday, Roberts said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Thunder announced Monday that beginning Dec. 1, fans attending games in person will no longer be required provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. “We have decided to lift our vaccination/testing requirements,” a team statement said, citing a decline in coronavirus cases and an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations in Oklahoma County. “Since we announced the protocols in September, the Oklahoma Department of Health reports the percentage of Oklahoma County residents 12 and older who are fully or partially vaccinated has risen to 85%,” according to the statement. “The number of COVID cases statewide has dropped approximately 60% and hospitalizations have declined at similar rates.” The requirements remain in place for games scheduled for Wednesday and Friday. The NBA suspended the 2020 season in March that year after two Utah Jazz players tested positive for the coronavirus prior to a scheduled game in Oklahoma City.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Supreme Court on Monday dismissed two challenges filed by Republicans to new legislative districts approved by the Legislature in September. The lawmakers passed new legislative and congressional boundaries that included a new, sixth U.S. House seat. The ruling Monday was specifically about the 90 state legislative districts that will likely enable Democrats to continue to hold majorities in the House and Senate but will not guarantee the party the three-fifths supermajorities it currently holds. Republicans throughout the redistricting process accused Democrats of gerrymandering. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in petitions challenging the maps, Republicans alleged that Democratic lawmakers drew districts for partisan political gain and to help incumbents. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the GOP failed to show that the new districts violated state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Sean Parnell, a U.S. Senate candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump, on Monday suspended his campaign after he lost a court fight over custody of his three children in which the judge said he believed allegations of abuse by Parnell’s estranged wife. In a statement, Parnell said he was devastated by the judge’s decision and planned to ask the judge to reconsider, but he cannot continue his campaign. The high-stakes campaign in the battleground state could help determine control of the U.S. Senate in next year’s election. A Pennsylvania seat is opening up with the retirement in 2023 of two-term Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, and both Republicans and Democrats have a big field of candidates in the politically divided state. Parnell’s withdrawal comes as many in the state Republican Party remain undecided about their field, which includes conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate investor Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, Trump’s ambassador to Denmark. Also swirling is a suggestion from Mehmet Oz – the cardiac surgeon and longtime host of TV’s “Dr. Oz Show” who gained fame as a protege of Oprah Winfrey – that he is being encouraged to enter the Republican primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 1 in 6 households across the state struggles to put enough food on the table – significantly lower than during the height of the pandemic last year but higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to a report released Monday. Black and Latino households were particularly hard-hit this year, with 34% each unable to meet basic food needs, according to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s 2021 Status Report on Hunger. Hunger is also “alarmingly high” in families with children, as 1 in 4 cannot meet basic food needs, the report said. The number of food-insecure households in Rhode Island is expected to grow as government programs that supported low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic end. “Post-pandemic recovery simply doesn’t apply to the lives of many Rhode Islanders,” Andrew Schiff, chief executive officer of the food bank, said in a statement. “As supportive government programs and benefits disappear, the ripple effects of COVID-19 continue to be seen on the kitchen tables of people across the state.” The numbers are based on the RI Life Index, compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Federal agents are looking for someone who used a metal detector and dug 19 holes earlier this month looking for artifacts at a historic site that was once the Charleston-area plantation of a signer of the U.S. Constitution. Rangers at the Charles Pinckney National Historic Site found the holes all over the park Nov. 13, the National Park Service said in a statement. Some of them had discarded metal artifacts nearby, and some did not, leading rangers to think a thief was using a metal detector to steal selected artifacts, investigators said. The digging also caused damage to resources at the park, said Kate Funk, chief of resource management at the site. It is illegal both to dig without permission and to have a working metal detector at a national park site, officials said. “Archaeologists make a great effort to record the context from which artifacts are recovered to better understand their use and disposition and the wider historical picture. All this important information is now lost because of this illegal excavation,” Funk said. The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site was once a Lowcountry plantation that produced rice and indigo and was owned by the man sometimes called one of the forgotten signers of the U.S. Constitution. The site also tells the story of how slaves were treated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local police say they’re staffed and ready to run security for the Parade of Lights in light of recent events out of Wisconsin. The Parade of Lights is returning to downtown Sioux Falls for its 29th celebration this year. The parade is slated to start at 7:30 p.m. Friday, bringing lights, floats and music to downtown. Last year’s celebration was canceled amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In a police briefing Monday, Lt. Andrew Siebenborn discussed potential changes to security for the parade given recent events in Wisconsin that led to multiple deaths and more than 40 people injured in a parade. “We always staff for the worst-case scenario,” Siebenborn said. The incident in Waukesha, Wisconsin, happened during a Christmas parade Sunday. An SUV rammed through the parade, striking a high school band, children’s dance group and the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies. Siebenborn said he couldn’t discuss specifics about the security detail at Sioux Falls’ parade Friday but said weeks and sometimes months of planning go into security protocols. “Credit goes out to our chief and command staff erring on the side of almost overstaffing an event in the interest of safety,” he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The ex-girlfriend of the man who detonated an explosive in downtown Nashville last Christmas has filed a lawsuit, saying she should receive $284,000 in rewards offered after the blast. Pamela Perry filed suit Friday in Davidson County Chancery Court seeking the reward because she came forward “at great personal risk to aid law enforcement in identifying” Anthony Warner as the bomber. Warner parked an RV in the middle of a tourist district early Dec. 25 before setting off the blast that killed him, injured several others and heavily damaged dozens of buildings, including a key AT&T network facility. After the blast, Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis offered a $250,000 reward and Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. offered $34,500 to anyone who came forward with information identifying the bomber. The Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. gave the $34,500 it raised to law enforcement organizations including the Metro Nashville Police Department. On Friday, convention officials said they hadn’t seen the lawsuit and couldn’t comment, but CEO Butch Spyridon told WTVF-TV in May that hundreds of tips were called in, and an FBI report thanked law enforcement but didn’t identify citizens who gave tips. “I don’t have documentation to say this helped more than anything else,” Spyridon said.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A late October land transaction helped to complete one of the largest land purchases and donations of unspoiled coastal land in the state. The final 1,360 acres of the Powderhorn Ranch donated to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be added to nearly 15,000 acres donated to TPWD in 2018 by the Texas Park and Wildlife Foundation. The transaction conserves one of the state’s largest “unspoiled coastal prairies in Texas,” and it one day will become a state park. “It demonstrates how Texas’ community of conservationists can work hand-in-hand with the state to preserve an extraordinary piece of our natural heritage for generations to come,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. According to a 2015 story published by Texas Monthly, the land’s history dates back nearly 500 years. The Karankawa hunted there, and the explorers Rene Robert Cavelier and Sieur de La Salle lost a ship to a storm in 1686, according to the story. Included in the land is nearly 11 miles of coast along Matagorda Bay, and the site is near the Aransas Wildlife Refuge, making one of the longest stretches of unspoiled coastline in Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For decades, the U.S. Forest Service’s practice of putting out wildfires was a huge success. But the policy backfired, setting the stage for the massive destructive wildfires that have flared with increasing regularity across the West. While putting out fires remains a priority, deliberately setting them is becoming more common, especially in Utah, as a more cost-effective and ecologically sound strategy for fixing forest health, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The pitfalls of fire suppression are evident across Monroe Mountain in central Utah. The plateau’s historically abundant aspen stands are disappearing under thickets of fir and other conifers that have long impeded fresh aspen growth that should be succeeding the aging trees but aren’t. In the hopes of restoring the historic role of fire, at least three Utah national forests plan to sharply expand the use of “prescribed fire” to nurse sickly forests back to health. Like much of the West’s wooded terrain, large parts of the Fishlake National Forest are ecologically wired to burn from time to time. To thrive, aspen groves need to get wiped out from time to time, said Richfield District Ranger Jason Kling of the Fishlake National Forest. “That keeps the fuels in check, not allowing the overgrowth to occur, keeping the landscape open, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor,” Kling said.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: Killington ski resort is making final preparations to host women’s World Cup ski racing on Thanksgiving weekend. The event was postponed last year amid the pandemic. This year tickets are being sold to control attendance, and proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within the prior 72 hours is required to attend. “We usually have about 15,000 people each day, and we are trying to cut that in about half. Even though it is an outdoor event, we really wanted to be able to get people to be careful in terms of being too close to each other,” said Mike Solimano, Killington’s president and general manager. Snow guns have been blasting, and race organizer FIS gave Killington a positive snow control Wednesday, which means the race is on. “We’re feeling confident. I mean it’s definitely been warm, and it’s been a struggle, but it looks like we’re gonna make it,” Solimano said last week.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: Reports of black bears afflicted with mange are growing in Northern Virginia. What used to be fewer than 10 sightings a year in 2018 has grown to more than 100 annual reports. “Those are just the ones that people see. We’re sure there are quite a few more bears that are out in the woods that are not encountering a person,” said Katie Martin, a deer, bear and turkey biologist for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. The area where most cases are reported is confined to a dozen counties roughly north of Interstate 64 and west of U.S. 29, including Fauquier, Culpeper, Loudoun and Prince William counties. Infestations of sarcoptic mange can be mild, fatal or anywhere in between. “And if it’s a severe case, and they lose all their hair, and they stop eating and become emaciated, then obviously that bear going into the winter is going to have a much harder time surviving,” Martin said. Preventing bears from congregating and spreading the disease to one another has proven to be a challenge. Residents are being asked to do their part. Anyone who has seen a bear near their property is asked to take down bird feeders for a minimum of two weeks after the sighting to prevent the bears from returning. Martin said she believes no one should have bird feeders out at all between April and November.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Steve Hobbs was sworn in Monday as Washington’s 16th secretary of state, the first person of color to head the office and the first Democrat to hold the position in 56 years. Hobbs, who is of Japanese descent, is leaving his Senate seat representing the 44th legislative district to replace Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman. The fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating back to 1965, Wyman is taking a key election security job in the Biden administration. Hobbs was sworn in by state Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu in the state reception room at the state Capitol, after which he thanked Wyman in his speech, saying she understood and dealt with the threats of cyber and information warfare in the elections sphere. “I’m going to build upon that,” he said. “And I’m glad that we’ll have a partner in Washington, D.C., to build upon that.” Wyman will serve as the election security lead for the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the agency responsible for safeguarding U.S. elections. In the role, she will serve as the federal government’s top liaison to the states. Hobbs said that in addition to building upon cybersecurity efforts in the state, he plans to create a plan to respond to misinformation and disinformation that hits elections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Tolls on the West Virginia Turnpike will increase at the beginning of next year, officials said. The rate for most passenger vehicles will rise by 5% on Jan. 1, going from $4 to $4.25, West Virginia Parkways Authority Executive Director Jeffrey Miller told a legislative committee, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The E-Z Pass annual program will also see an increase from $25 annually to $26.50, Miller said. The proposed fee schedule for the turnpike allows up to a 5% increase every three years, he said. Voters approved selling up to $1.6 billion in bonds to fund the Roads to Prosperity program in 2017, and the Parkways Authority has returned $595 million from tolls to the state to support projects for the 10 counties affected by the Turnpike, Miller said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge says the state Department of Natural Resources violated the law by not immediately scheduling a wolf hunting season after federal protections were removed in February. In an order Thursday, Jefferson County Judge Bennett Brantmeier said the agency must hold a hunt immediately any time federal protections are lifted during the statutory hunting season, which runs from November through February. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by Hunter Nation Inc. that challenged the agency’s decision not to hold a hunt as soon as the gray wolf was removed from the endangered list in January, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Brantmeier is the same judge who last winter ordered the DNR to hold a hunt in the final days of February. State-licensed hunters killed at least 218 wolves in less than three days, more than the state and tribal quotas combined. However, wolf hunting in Wisconsin remains on hold while a Dane County judge considers a lawsuit filed in August by a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate the law requiring it. In a ruling last month, Judge Jacob Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: With just four years left before its coal plant shutters, this southwestern Wyoming town, population 2,750, has been bracing for a seemingly inevitable loss. Along with the neighboring coal mine, the Naughton Power Plant is one of the biggest employers in Kemmerer. Its closure was expected to cut local jobs, slash revenue and force some residents to move away for work. Then nuclear developer TerraPower announced last week that it would build a next-generation nuclear reactor in Naughton’s place and staff the new facility with the existing Naughton workforce. Kemmerer and three other candidate coal towns – Glenrock, Gillette and Rock Springs – had waited six months for the decision. Over those months, the prospect of getting an advanced nuclear reactor has injected new optimism into a community used to weathering the booms and busts of the state’s energy industry, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. “We’re absolutely ecstatic,” Mayor Bill Thek said. “We’ve been hopeful from the beginning, and as time went on, we became more and more hopeful.” Some people are apprehensive about living near a demonstration nuclear reactor, he said, but few are outright opposed.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2019/08/15/oakridge-des-moines-iowa-housing-project-50-year-anniversary-margaret-toomey-teree-caldwell-johnson/1945061001/", "title": "Oakridge Neighborhood in Des Moines marks 50 years of ...", "text": "On grassy pastures where Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples recruited new members and battled for drug territory, kids now chase one another while adults, mostly women, supervise.\n\nThe leaders and residents of the Oakridge Neighborhood — a low-income housing complex marking a half-century in Des Moines this year — say that battles with crime over the decades are just a part of Oakridge's story, especially recently.\n\nThey're proud of grassroots measures undertaken to temper gang and drug violence that wracked the project in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThey're proud of taking a failing housing complex and turning it into a community with child care and adult-training services that garner millions of dollars each year in grants and donations.\n\nThey're proud of the clean, regularly rehabilitated homes they provide to a majority-immigrant community leaders say is made up of 79% single-parent households, with an average income of about $10,600.\n\nAt 1,100 people, the community is larger than nearly two-thirds of Iowa towns.\n\n\"There is such a dearth of affordable housing, but if you're going to rent to families, you have to provide services,\" said former nun and former Oakridge CEO Margaret Toomey.\n\nThe community is experiencing some of its greatest scholarly success in history. Twenty of the 22 high school seniors who lived there this past year graduated, said Vernon Johnson, who coordinates the youth programs at the complex.\n\n\"Of that 20, 17 of them are enrolled in college or are enrolling in college. This last group, we had six kids get academic scholarships,\" Johnson said. \"See, things can happen here. Good things can come out of this community here.\"\n\nCommunity of leaders overhauls Oakridge\n\nThe start was not auspicious. Originally called the Homes of Oakridge, the organization was steeped in infrastructural and financial ruin by the mid-1970s, a few years after opening. Mortgage payments on the nearly 17-acre property were almost $2 million behind.\n\nToomey said bookkeeping and infrastructural problems led the complex's leadership to ask the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to take over management. Mudslides had made some apartments unrentable, and vandalism and apathy were pervasive.\n\nBut with the help of donors — both those who lent money and others who contributed time and expertise — the nun from Wisconsin helped bring structure to the housing project.\n\nToomey had come to Oakridge in 1973, about a year after arriving in Des Moines to teach at ministries for college students. She was introduced to the housing project by an acquaintance.\n\n“I did not want to live in a convent. I wanted to live where there were people,\" she said, \"and when I saw Oakridge, there were so many kids and so many people that I thought I would like it. And I did.”\n\nShe became a community organizer — helping other residents fight a surprise rent increase — then a member of the board of directors in 1973, and finally the complex manager in 1975.\n\n“First, my job was to find out who lived there,\" Toomey said with a chuckle. \"There were all sorts of occupants in apartments that weren’t on a lease at all.”\n\nA new management group led by representatives from Iowa Realty, Bankers Trust and other influential business leaders helped find volunteers to pull the complex out of disrepair and train the staff.\n\nThese corporate sponsors helped pay back the nearly $2 million in mortgage debt that had built up.\n\nToomey tried to instill educational programs for children, work programs for adults and increased safety measures. The team started applying for grants and lobbying businesses for donations.\n\nAn unwanted reputation for violence\n\nNew troubles followed.\n\nThe invasion of crack cocaine in cities across the Midwest wreaked havoc on poor, black communities. Oakridge, which has had a majority-minority population throughout its existence, was no different.\n\nGang and drugs gripped Oakridge in the late 1980s and 1990s, even as mothers and families fought back. Two people were slain at the complex in 1996. Toomey, who ran Oakridge for 20 years, repeatedly battled criminal activity and negative perceptions, which she said were tough to dispel during this time.\n\n\"No question about it. I mean, all you had to do is tell 'em the stories I told you today, that would terrify anyone,\" she said. \"There’s the bad stuff, but I always felt the support.”\n\nWith the help of community leaders, she instilled youth and adult programs for some of Des Moines' poorest families, and worked with residents and law enforcement to stamp out recurrent, rampant crime.\n\nNow Oakridge doesn't experience that level of violence, said Sgt. Paul Parizek, a second-generation Des Moines police officer.\n\n\"When crack cocaine started rolling in, you didn’t know what the hell to do. We didn’t have a playbook for that,\" said Parizek, who was a street cop in Des Moines at the time. “That epidemic spread like a forest fire, so you didn’t have a plan in your pocket, you had to talk to other people about, ‘OK, what works for you?’ then figure out how you can make that work.\"\n\nSheryl Jackman, 70, remembers the prevalence of gangs and drugs at Oakridge. She's worked in the housing department there for 30-plus years and lived on campus in the 1970s.\n\nToomey and Jackman said some families from larger cities would settle in Oakridge, and suddenly, adult men with gang ties were holding court on the grounds. By the end of the 1980s, Toomey said, the Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples instilled fear in residents.\n\nWhile out-of-town drug dealers had recruited young Des Moines kids and intimidated people not to call police, Jackman and others were trying to fight crime.\n\n“We did marches through here,\" Jackman said, recalling the late 1980s. \"We would sit out and watch, keep eyes open, we wrote down license plate numbers, turned them in. We had building captains that met with the tenants and tried to make people comfortable making reports.”\n\nOne march garnered 700 people.\n\nThe violence was a persistent problem for Oakridge for about 10 years.\n\nAs drug use and gun violence subsided nationwide near the turn of the century, so did violent criminal behavior in Oakridge, Parizek said. He attributed increased safety in the community not to police work, but to community, city and corporate action and resident determination.\n\nMore Iowa news:\n\nStability key as leadership changes hands\n\nToomey retired from Oakridge in 2001. Strong leadership and an experienced staff — the average tenure is nine years — have sustained successes, she said.\n\nServices have expanded under Teree Caldwell-Johnson, who took over as Oakridge's CEO 15 years ago. More youth programs have gained state accreditation and campus facilities have grown.\n\n“We really set about being much more intentional about compliance, rules — not to suggest that we were being ‘big brother’ by any stretch of the imagination, but holding people accountable,\" Caldwell-Johnson said.\n\nDespite the improvements, some outside of Oakridge still associate the neighborhood with danger. Jackman said that started from the moment the project broke ground.\n\nTemarco Mitchell, 26, lives and works in Oakridge. He said people who don't live there suspect the worst about it.\n\n\"They still think that shootings or gang violence or fighting that’s all that’s up here when it’s not,\" he said. \"It’s definitely positive up here.\"\n\nParizek said that as the neighborhood has improved aesthetically, so, too, have outsiders' idea of Oakridge.\n\nFor instance, instead of a tow yard and a bus depot flanking the property, new office buildings, restaurants and gas stations on Keosauqua Way, just southeast of the complex, have improved the local economy.\n\nAn in-house security team has made the organization less reliant on police, and fencing put up under Toomey stopped people who didn't belong there from walking through the green spaces.\n\n\"The external influences that caused them problems there, I think they have worked very hard to eradicate them from the Oakridge community,\" Parizek said. \"The whole thing is the partnership that is going on in that whole area. It’s made a huge difference.\"\n\nNot all news has been good news recently. The 2016 shooting of Yore Jieng, a smart, involved 14-year-old who lived in Oakridge, remains unsolved. He was shot not too far from his home.\n\nToomey said she's happy to see Oakridge still providing \"essential\" services to those who need it most.\n\n\"The only way out of poverty is education,\" she said.\n\nMore Iowa news:\n\nA welcoming center for immigrants\n\nOakridge is many people's first experience with the U.S. Twenty-five languages are spoken by the 1,100 or so people there and about 48% of the population is from African countries. Another 11% come from the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\n“Typically, our data tells us that about 62% of our families are here from zero to five years, so this is just really is a temporary stop for many people to gain some stability,\" Caldwell-Johnson said. \"For many of our families who are now immigrants and refugees to really figure out how you make a way in this country.\"\n\nOakridge's English as a second language and job-training classes for those new to America are used by those off campus, too. Only about half of the people in the campus' \"Transitions\" program live at Oakridge.\n\nNew plans for the community include upgraded amenities, renovations to green spaces and play area, and, of course, new programs for kids and families.\n\nThe directors say Oakridge's setup has allowed it survive. Instead of large, unsightly buildings that are a staple of other cities' public housing, Oakridge is a townhome-style community.\n\nAnother part of its survival has been intense donations from the community. Caldwell-Johnson says more than $3 million is raised annually.\n\n\"We are not cookie-cutter. We really try to identify and develop strategies that are specific to the individual and or the family,\" she said. \"People want to see results, they want to fund things that are working, that are successful, and we’re very proud of the successes that we’ve been able to achieve the last several years.”\n\nTimeline\n\nJanuary 1967 - Plans for 300 apartments for low-income families approved by Des Moines Area Council of Churches.\n\nMay 1968 - $4 million Homes of Oakridge called \"a credit to our humanity\" at groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nMay 1968 - Des Moines City Council members outraged at hiring of Omaha contractor Don Decker when they learn of his conviction for making false statements to obtain federally insured loan, his tax liens and his development of a Nebraska project that critics called \"instant slum.\"\n\nJanuary 1969 - IRS files another $70,000 in tax liens against Decker's companies and he drops out of sight, leaving Oakridge project stranded.\n\nMay 1969 - Partly finished Oakridge building set afire.

I am very proud that they chose me to continue developing this business. That means the company views me as someone who fully shares all the principles of business and values of McDonald’s,” Govor said at a press conference.\n\n“I won’t hide the fact that I am an ambitious man, and so I am not just going to simply open up all 850 restaurants but I am going to develop new ones as well,” he said.\n\nAccording to a press release, 62,000 former McDonald’s employees were also retained.\n\nA McDonald's restaurant is shown closed following the military invasion of Ukraine on April 14, 2022 in Belaya Dacha, outside of Moscow.

It took place at the same location in Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square, where McDonald’s opened its first Russian restaurant on January 31, 1990.\n\nOn the first day, 30,000 people were served – a McDonald’s record for an opening day, the CBC reported at the time. The location even had to stay open for hours later than planned because of the crowds.\n\nAbout 630 employees were chosen out of 27,000 applicants, according to a 1990 Washington Post article.\n\n“Approximately 32 years ago…there were a lot of people on Pushkinskaya Square, when the first McDonald’s franchise opened here in Russia. It caused quite the craze. I think the craze will be just as big with this new chain of restaurants, with a new owner, a real entrepreneur,” Alexei Alexeevich, the Head of the Department of Commerce of Moscow, said during a press conference on Sunday.\n\nAn employee cleans a self-ordering machine at the Russian version of a former McDonald's restaurant before the opening ceremony, in Moscow.

Paroev has said other franchises could work under the new brand, but the traditional McDonald’s brand will leave the country.\n\nRussia’s anti-monopoly service said the chain could elect to buy its restaurants in Russia back within 15 years, although many terms of the sale to Govor are still unclear, Reuters also reported.\n\nAn employee prepares fries in the Russian version of a former McDonald's restaurant.

Corporations raised prices when snarled supply chains during the pandemic created shortages of nearly everything, and just never stopped or lowered prices again after supply chains stabilized, they argue.\n\n“Some companies are keeping prices high even though input costs are falling, and supply chains are back to normal,” the White House said in a news release in March.\n\nIf higher grocery prices are the result of potential mergers between larger supermarkets and food producers and corporate greed, Americans may benefit from Harris' approach. However, many economists have doubts such a policy would be effective for various reasons, including whether price gouging is the root of inflation at all.\n\nMichael Ashton, managing principal at Enduring Investments LLC, who specializes in inflation analysis, questioned the existence of price gouging \"in an industry as competitive as grocery.\"\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n“Why did the price gouging just start in 2021-22?\" he asked. \"Did grocers just not realize they had this power before then or did they not get greedy until 2021?”\n\nProfit margins in the food industry already tend to be among the lowest. Net profit margin in 2023 in the grocery industry hit 1.6%, the lowest level since 2019, according to FMI, The Food Industry Association.\n\nWhat caused food prices to spike?\n\nDuring the pandemic, economists generally agreed supply chain shortages initially caused price increases.\n\nAfter supply chains were ironed out, the dispute began. Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke separately said last year that fast-rising wages when the economy reopened was a major contributor to rising grocery prices.\n\nHowever, left-leaning government watchdog Accountable.US and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich say companies have been raising prices on Americans to reward stockholders with dividends and stock buybacks.\n\n“Consumers are getting shafted, as corporations tell Wall Street they expect to be able to keep their prices and profits in the stratosphere,” Reich wrote in June.\n\nThe Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit that earlier this year said \"climate change, corporate consolidation, and profiteering\" are reasons grocery prices remain high, even quantified in January how much corporate greed contributed to inflation. In the middle of 2023, corporate profit margins accounted for roughly half of inflation and more than a third since the pandemic began, it estimated.\n\n“The industry keeps pushing the envelope to pad profits and bring in enough money for shareholder giveaways, but Americans are fed up,” said Liz Zelnick, director of the economic security & corporate power program at Accountable.US, in a news release.\n\nInflation's down but prices are high?: Prices don't drop when inflation eases. Why your wallet will be hurting for a while.\n\nCould Harris’ plan work to lower food prices?\n\nOpinions are mixed.\n\nReich, who sees corporate greed as the root of soaring inflation, advocated for a policy like what Harris is expected to announce.\n\n“Put blame for high prices squarely where it belongs: on big corporations with monopoly power to keep prices high,” he wrote. “And take those corporations on: Condemn them for price gouging. Threaten them with antitrust lawsuits, price-gouging lawsuits, even price controls. Criticize them for making huge profits and giving their top executives record pay while shafting consumers.”\n\nOthers, like Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., call the plan “federal price controls,” which he says don’t work.\n\nHarris’ solution to fighting inflation “is big government on steroids – where Washington bureaucrats stick their hands into American businesses and say what they can and can’t sell a product for,” he said in a news release on Thursday. “It never works because it causes companies to make much less of something – destroying supply and causing a mass shortage of goods.”\n\nSuch a policy could also be difficult to implement because calculating an appropriate profit margin might be tricky, said James Knightley, Dutch bank ING’s chief international economist.\n\n“It’s critical that we get the economic facts right and avoid political rhetoric,\" said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs at the Consumer Brands Association trade group. \"The reality is that there are complex economic factors at play.\"\n\nIs food inflation still even a thing?\n\nThree in 5 Americans said corporate greed was a “major cause” of inflation, according to a poll by left-leaning polling and research group Navigator Research of 1,000 registered voters. However, that was in January when annual inflation was running at a 3.1% pace. Since then, inflation has eased further.\n\n\"When looking at the inflation story, it's good now but the perception among consumers is different because prices are still elevated,\" Knightley said. \"We're not returning to 2019 prices,\" which is what consumers are comparing to.\n\nSince inflation only measures the pace at which prices are changing, actual sticker prices remain high from climbing over the past couple of years. Inflation in the 12 months through July was 2.9%, sharply down from its 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 and the lowest since March 2021. Overall, annual food inflation rose a smaller 2.2%, with grocery prices rising at an even slower 1.1% pace.\n\n“Why intervene?” Knightley said. “From an economics perspective, it’s looking like a pretty good place right now. This may be good messaging for the election, but it (inflation) may be falling by the wayside.”\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

And as president I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.”\n\nOn the war in Gaza, Harris said “now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done.”\n\n“Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,” she said. “Because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7.”\n\nShe also said “what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating.”\n\n“The scale of suffering is heartbreaking,” she said. “President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages is released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nReproductive rights get center-stage moment in Harris’ speech\n\nBashing her opponent and the GOP’s record, Harris highlighted reproductive rights as a key issue in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\n“Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said of Trump and Republicans. “And one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women?”\n\n“Well, we trust women,” she continued, adding that as president she would “proudly sign” legislation to enshrine abortion access.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been the leading voice in the current Biden administration on reproductive rights and abortion access – a winning issue for many Democrats since 2022.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris vows to bring back bipartisan border deal Trump bashed\n\nHarris said that after decades in law enforcement, she knows the “importance of safety and security, especially at our border.”\n\n“Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades,” she said. The bill was killed by Senate Republicans in February after pressure from Trump.\n\n“Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,” she alleged. “Well I refuse to play politics with our security. And here is my pledge to you as President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'New path forward'\n\nHarris told convention attendees that her campaign is all about charting a “new path forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class.”\n\n“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success, and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said.\n\nHarris said that, if elected, she would pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. She said her term would also also allow Americans to “fully make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home,” she said, referring to reproductive rights and other matters.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump hits Harris and her speech\n\nNot exactly breaking news: Donald Trump gave bad reviews to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech.\n\nIn a constant stream of Truth Social posts, Trump assailed the vice president's remarks on items ranging from the condition of her former home city of San Francisco to inflation, immigration and relations with other countries.\n\nAfter Harris accused him of wanting to be an autocrat, Trump concluded by saying: \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she’s weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\"\n\nAt another point, Trump pointed out that Harris and President Joe Biden have ignored the issues that came up in the speech: \"No specific programs, ALL TALK, NO ACTION - Why didn’t she do it three and a half years ago.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHarris zeroes in on Trump in convention address\n\nKamala Harris called out former President Donald Trump by name in her acceptance speech, saying the former president is “in many ways ... an unserious man.”\n\n“But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious,” Harris said.\n\nPointing to what she called the “chaos and calamity” of his first term, Harris raised alarms about her 2024 opponent.\n\n“Consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol,” she said, referring to Trump’s comments about potentially pardoning January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris lays out her record as a prosecutor\n\nHarris walked the crowd through her history as a prosecutor, both at the local level and as California's attorney general. \"As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,\" she said.\n\n\"As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by for-profit colleges and workers who were cheated out of their wages.\n\n\"I fought against the cartels who traffic in dugs and guns and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities,\" she said. \"And I will tell you, these fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the DNC’s decision not to platform a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention was a “huge mistake.” That had been a key ask of the protesters seeking to push the Democratic Party towards a more pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n“I think it undermines our messaging about unity, about diversity,” said Omar, one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress.\n\nOmar said she spoke with the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, multiple times in an effort to push the committee to change their mind. \"Last I heard from the Harris campaign was for us to be patient,” she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has touted her and Biden’s efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

That’s Kamala. And we all know what happened. The banks caved.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nKamala Harris’ sister, Maya Harris, pays tribute to their mother\n\nMaya Harris, Kamala Harris’ younger sister, opened her remarks by reflecting on her mother, Dr. Shyamala Gopalan Harris.\n\n“Mommy was so many things to so many people, a civil rights activist, a scientist, a devoted mother to her two little girls,” said Maya Harris. “But most of all, Mommy was a trailblazer who defied the odds and defined herself. And when it came to Kamala and me, Mommy had great expectations for us, but she had even greater expectations of us.”\n\n“She raised us to believe that we could be and do anything, and we believed her.”\n\nMaya Harris said that she wishes her mom, who died in 2009, could have attended the convention.\n\n“ I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala,” said Maya Harris.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDon't bet on a Beyoncéappearance\n\nBeyoncé's publicist Yvette Noel-Schure shut down speculation about Beyoncé appearing at the DNC, despite reports.\n\nMinutes before fans hoped to see the \"Cowboy Carter\" singer on the convention stag, Noel-Schure posted to her Instagram.\n\n\"At home watching and anticipating the VP’s historic speech,” she wrote. “Focus on the win and register to vote. Do not report rumors. FOCUS.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to report that according to a representative for the singer, \"Beyoncé was never scheduled to be there.”\n\nLeading up to the DNC, fans speculated the megastar might perform. Of course, Walz has been deemed a certified Beyhive member. And Beyoncé's camp gave Harris approval to use her song \"Freedom\" featuring Kendrick Lamar on her campaign trail. The song has become an anthem for Harris' campaign.\n\n− Liz Schubauer\n\nAnother Republican for Harris addresses Democratic audience\n\nSaying he was “proud to be in the trenches” with the evening’s crowd, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger acknowledged the “awkward alliance” between himself and Democrats.\n\n“I never thought I’d be here, but listen,” he told the audience, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?”\n\n“The Republican party is no longer conservative. It has switched its allegiance from the principles that gave it purpose to a man whose only purpose is himself,” Kinzinger added, referring to former President Trump.\n\nA turning point, Kinzinger said, was January 6, 2021. He was one of two Republicans to serve on the House committee investigating the insurrection at the Capitol. “How can a party claim to be patriotic if it idolizes a man who tried to overthrow a free and fair election?” Kinzinger asked.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nEva Longoria calls on Democrats to say ‘she se puede’\n\nActress Eva Longoria put a new twist on a popular chant as she urged the crowd to root for Harris’ success. Longoria told the crowd to take the Spanish phrase, “Si se puede,” meaning, “yes we can,” and turn it into “she se puede.”\n\nWhen somebody asks, ‘Is she going to be the first female president of the United States?’ we’re going to say, ‘She se puede,’” Longoria said.\n\n“We know how to work so let’s get to work,” she said. “Let’s turn all of this enthusiasm and joy into action between now and November 5th.

It was hard, but not extraordinary. It's life. Those nights reminded me who I was fighting for, people just trying to make it. Kamala Harris knows who she's fighting for too,” she said.\n\nWhitmer also knocked Trump in her remarks, saying he can’t relate with everyday families.\n\n“You think he understands that when your car breaks down? You can't get to work? No, his first word was probably chauffeur. You think he's ever had to take items out of the cart before checking out? Hell, you think he's ever been to a grocery store? That's what the chauffeur is for,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRuben Gallego leads Democratic veterans onstage, tells Trump to ‘show some respect’\n\nArizona Senate nominee Ruben Gallego led a group of Democratic veterans, including members of the U.S. House and Senate, onstage, urging Donald Trump to “show some respect” to veterans.\n\n“We were proud to wear the uniform,” said Gallego, a congressman who served in the Marines. “And we’re proud serving our countries in city halls, state capitols, the U.S. House and the Senate. These veterans represent the best of our country. We stand united as veterans, Democrats and patriots to fight for everyone who serves.”\n\nGallego said “politicians like Donald Trump” don’t stand with veterans. He referred to Trump’s frequent insults to the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona.\n\n“John McCain was an American hero,” Gallego said. “Show some respect.”\n\n“Trump’s Project 2025 would slash veteran benefits and force VA hospitals to close across the nation,” he said. “Show some respect.”\n\n--Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nMark Kelly says Trump ‘dreaming’ of becoming a dictator\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly said Harris will stand with America’s allies and is “the leader we need right now.” Harris, he said, understands the importance of international alliances like NATO, and of supporting Ukraine in its war defending itself from Russia’s invasion.\n\n“Donald Trump skipped his intelligence briefings,” Kelly said. “He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself.”\n\nKelly referred to a 2020 report in The Atlantic that said Trump described fallen service members were “suckers” and “losers.” Trump denies the report.\n\n“Trump thinks that Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are suckers and losers,” Kelly said. “If we fall for that again and make him the commander in chief, the only suckers would be us.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miler\n\nDenied a speaker, pro-Palestinian Democratic delegates make new demand on Kamala Harris\n\nStymied in their demand that a Palestinian-American be allowed to speak to the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, a group of uncommitted delegates ended a protest outside the United Center on Thursday with a new demand: that Vice President Kamala Harris meet Arab-American and Muslims in Michigan and elsewhere.\n\nThey also set a deadline for such a meeting or meetings to take place of Sept. 15.\n\nWhile not saying what they would or would not do if a meeting did not take place to discuss their insistence that the U.S. stop shipping weapons to Israel and demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the organizers suggested there would be ramifications. Those could potentially involve holding back in terms of organizing on Harris' behalf in the fall campaign or arguing her case to voters.\n\n−Todd Spangler, Karissa Waddick and Tamia Fowlkes\n\nGroup shares harrowing stories about gun violence\n\nA group took to the stage at the convention Thursday night to retell somber stories about the loss of their loved ones from gun violence.

Twenty-six people were killed at the school in a mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012.\n\nKim Rubio recalled when her daughter Lexi walked into Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, for the last time.\n\n“It’s 10:30am at Robb Elementary in Uvalde,” Rubio said. “The school is recognizing my 10 year old daughter, Lexi, for receiving all A's. She receives a good citizen award, and we pose for photos. She wears a St Mary's sweatshirt and a smile that lights up the room.”\n\n“30 minutes later, a gunman murders her 18 classmates and two teachers. We are taken to a private room where police tell us she isn't coming home,” Rubio said.\n\nMelody McFadden told convention attendees about when her niece was shot in Myrtle Beach. “10 years of waiting, and Sandy's murder is still unsolved. I'll keep calling and I'll keep fighting,” McFadden said. Edgar Vilchez, whose friend was killed in a shooting at their high school, said that moment changed him. “Instead about worrying about taking a test, I started worrying about living to take another test,” he said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nShooting survivor and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords takes the stage\n\nPart of a series of speakers to address gun violence, mass shooting survivor and former Rep.

Now she's guiding my own children, and I know she'll guide our country forward,” said Meena Harris.\n\nElla Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, said that the vice president came into her life when she was 14 - “famously a very easy time for a teenager,” she joked.\n\n“Like a lot of young people, I didn't always understand what I was feeling. But no matter what, Kamala was there for me. She was patient, caring, and always took me seriously. She's never stopped listening to me, and she's not going to stop listening to all of us,” Emhoff said.\n\nHelena Hudlin, goddaughter of Harris, said that Kamala Harris’ advice “means everything, whether it's pursuing my passions, making an impact, or finding hope when the world doesn't feel so hopeful.”\n\n“She taught me that making a difference means giving your whole heart and taking action,” Hudlin said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKerry Washington brings 'Scandal' costar Tony Goldwyn, Harris family members on stage with her\n\nActress Kerry Washington helped host the final hours of the Democratic convention’s final night.\n\nShe brought back to the stage her former “Scandal” costar Tony Goldwyn, who days earlier also made a convention stage appearance.

He said she’s also worked to expand Pell grants, increase funding for HBCUs.\n\n“And Kamala Harris made public service loan relief a reality for teachers and first responders and firefighters and nurses and countless others across our land,” he said.\n\n“Vice President Harris delivered before and she will do it again,” he continued. “As president, she will build a brighter future. A more affordable future. A future where going to college doesn’t break the bank.”\n\n−Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nTaylor Swift? Beyoncé? What to know about those DNC surprise speaker rumors\n\nRumors swirled on Thursday about a surprise speaker making an appearance on the last night of the Democratic convention.\n\nUSA TODAY has not confirmed the speculation, but it hasn't stopped political observers from wondering if mega-stars like Beyoncé or Taylor Swift, who have both previously waded into politics, will show up in Chicago.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin talks about protecting Social Security, Medicare in remarks\n\nWisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin began her remarks with a personal note about her family.\n\n“My mother was a teenager when I was born, and she struggled with addiction. I never met my father, but I had two incredible grandparents who stepped in and raised me,” she said.\n\n“My grandparents were there for me, and as they grew older, it was my privilege to be there for them. So when I work to protect Medicare and Social Security, I do it with a personal knowledge of what those big programs meant in small but deeply meaningful ways to my grandparents,” she added.\n\nBaldwin accused former President Donald Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare “while giving a huge new tax break to billionaires and corporations.”\n\n“They've got it backwards. We Democrats, we honor our elders and ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share,” she said.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nCalifornia Sen. Alex Padilla says Harris will defend American dream\n\nSen. Alex Padilla said Harris will defend the American dream for families and kids. Padilla, a former California state lawmaker and secretary of state, was appointed to the Senate in 2021 after Harris was sworn in as vice president, and he won election to a full term in 2022.\n\nHe joked that when he took over Harris’ Senate seat, “I knew that I had some big Chuck Taylors to fill,” referencing the vice president's signature shoe.\n\n“My question for all of you tonight is this: This November, who’s ready to defend the dream?” he asked the audience, repeating the question in Spanish.\n\n“Tim Walz is ready to defend the dream,” Padilla continued. “Kamala Harris will defend the dream. And between now and Election Day each of us must defend the dream too, by electing them as vice president and president of the United States of America.”\n\n− Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nTeacher union presidents blast Trump, Vance\n\nBecky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, called former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance “not just wrong.”\n\n“They’re dangerous,” she said.\n\nPringle criticized Project 2025, a conservative guidebook for a Republican presidency that calls for eliminating the Department of Education. Trump has repeatedly denied association with the document.\n\nPresident of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten followed Pringle on stage and continued criticism of the Republican ticket.\n\n“Donald Trump and JD Vance can’t claim they’re pro-child while gutting funding for public schools,” Weingarten said.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVeronica Escobar kicks off welcome remarks at final night of convention\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, opened up her remarks knocking Trump for being a “small man speaking in small venues talking about small ideas.”\n\n“Our ideas, our vision for America, brings us together,” said Escobar.\n\n“Our vision for America embraces every community and everyone. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are working hard because they know our country is great. They know that we can build a future for all of us, and they're earning our votes by laying out a plan that puts the American dream not just within reach, but so we can fully grasp,” she added.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTennessee Three not expected to speak at DNC amid rumors of a mystery guest\n\nThe trio of Tennessee lawmakers known as the \"Tennessee Three\" were expected to get a primetime speaking slot at Thursday's Democratic National Convention, but the group is expected to be bumped from the program amid last-minute scheduling changes.\n\nState Reps. Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson will not be speaking from the DNC stage tonight, according to a Tennessee House Democratic caucus spokesperson.\n\nThe scheduling shift comes amid swirling rumors that a surprise speaker was being slotted into Thursday's night schedule. None of the rumors have been confirmed, though social media is abuzz that a high-profile celebrity such as Beyoncé or Taylor Swift may appear.\n\n− Melissa Brown\n\nWho are Ella and Cole Emhoff? Meet Kamala Harris' stepchildren − who call the VP 'Momala.'\n\nAs America’s first second gentleman, Doug Emhoff became the first person to bear the title when Vice President Kamala Harris was sworn into office in 2021.\n\nBut how did the two meet? Originally from Brooklyn and raised in New Jersey, Emhoff became an attorney in Los Angeles, focusing on entertainment and intellectual property law. In 2013, one of Emhoff’s clients – who also happened to be Harris’ best friend – set the pair up on a date.\n\nHarris and Emhoff were married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California where Harris’ sister, Maya, officiated. It was Harris’ first marriage and Emhoff’s second, and they share two adult children from his former marriage, Ella and Cole.\n\n− Victor Hagan\n\nGus Walz broke the internet with his tearful love for his dad. Then the bullying began\n\nAn emotional, unscripted moment between Tim Walz and his 17-year-old son, Gus, has unleased a flood of praise and admiration – but it also has prompted ugly online bullying.\n\nGus Walz, who has a nonverbal learning disorder as well as anxiety and ADHD, watched excitedly from the front row of Chicago’s United Center and sobbed openly Wednesday night as his father, the Democratic nominee for vice president, delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe Minnesota governor was recounting the difficult fertility treatment he and his wife, Gwen, went through to conceive their daughter, Hope.\n\nBut the show of affection triggered a swath of snark and ugly comments from internet trolls, many of them MAGA supporters of former President Donald Trump, who faces Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Walz in November.\n\n– Michael Collins and Sam Woodward\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nThere's a good chance you'd recognize Nadine Seiler. The 59-year-old woman has developed a knack for being at the right place at the right time to get photographed by the media as she protests former President Donald Trump and conservative policies like the Agenda 2025 plan to remake the federal government.\n\nMultiple news photographers have captured Seiler's protests across the country since at least 2019, from Chicago to Milwaukee to Miami to outside the Virginia home of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nThis isn't how she'd planned to spend her retirement savings after arriving in the United States from the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago nearly 40 years ago. But with her bright makeup and eye-catching signs, protest has become her calling. In Chicago, she's sleeping in a friend's van so she can keep costs down.\n\n\"I am crazy,\" Seiler said with a laugh. \"Nobody who is totally sane would do this.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nPop-up political protester: How one woman quit her job to hassle Trump nationwide\n\nHarris celebrates nomination + 10-year wedding anniversary\n\nKamala Harris will take the stage tonight to formally accept her party’s presidential nomination. She also has another cause for celebration Thursday: her and her husband, Doug Emhoff’s 10th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe pair married in 2014 in Santa Barbara, California. In his convention address Tuesday, Emhoff recalled an awkward voicemail he left for Harris when they first met and said she now plays the saved recording back for him each anniversary.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump travels to border\n\nAfter traveling to the Arizona-Mexico border to protest illegal crossings, Donald Trump began his speech Thursday with false comments about a \"coup\" against president and former election opponent Joe Biden.\n\n\"A very sad time for this country in many ways,\" Trump said. \"You had a candidate - I was no fan of Joe Biden - but the way he was taken out was a coup.\"\n\nTrump has protested having to run against Kamala Harris throughout his counter-convention tour this week, noting that she never received a primary vote. There was no coup, however; the party turned to Vice President Harris after Biden withdrew from the race last month.\n\nTo be sure, Trump did use most of his remarks Thursday to criticize the Bush-Harris administration's record on border security. The event that lasted more than an hour also featured family members who have lost loved ones in crimes committed by people who are in the country illegally.\n\nIn criticizing Harris, Trump said Harris \"will not mention the victims\" in her acceptance speech on Thursday night. During the convention, Democratic speakers said Trump is also responsible for border problems, having used his power over Republican lawmakers to block legislation that would have tightened the border.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhite House slams ‘anti-Semitic’ Donald Trump post targeting Josh Shapiro\n\nThe White House condemned a social media post from Donald Trump as “Antisemitic, dangerous and hurtful” after the former president referred to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as a “highly overrated Jewish Governor” and slammed his support for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social Wednesday night after Shapiro spoke at the Democratic National Convention, wrote that Shapiro “made a really bad and poorly delivered speech” for Harris – someone who Trump said “hates Israel and will do nothing” to help Israel survive.\n\n“Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had,” Trump wrote. “I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will.”\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, was among the final contenders for Harris’ vice-presidential running-mate before Harris ultimately picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. White House spokesman Herbie Ziskend, in a statement, called it “Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’”\n\nZiskend added: “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kinds.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters take the spotlight during DNC. What impact will they make?\n\nIt's been no 1968.\n\nThe prospect that massive protests over the war in Gaza would dominate the Democratic National Convention and bring mayhem to the streets of Chicago both energized supporters and instilled unease in others.\n\nBut headlines out of Chicago instead have been splashed with Democratic enthusiasm for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Gaza protests and marches, which attracted thousands of passionate demonstrators, have been significantly smaller than organizers predicted.\n\nThere's still one night to go, with the highest stakes yet for both the anti-war movement and the Chicago authorities as Harris formally accepts her party's nomination for president.\n\n– Sophie Carson, Terry Collins, Michael Loria, Tamia Fowlkes and Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat time does the DNC start tonight? Where to stream the DNC?\n\nThe convention will air live on its website, from the United Center in Chicago between 7 p.m to 11 p.m. ET (6 p.m. to 10 p.m. CT) Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nUSA TODAY will provide livestream coverage on YouTube each night of the DNC, Monday through Thursday.\n\n– Gabe Hauari\n\nDemocrats face uphill battle courting business community\n\nIn a high-rise building overlooking the Chicago River downtown, Democratic Party advocates made the case Tuesday that business leaders should step up their opposition to GOP-led threats to U.S. democracy – not for moral reasons, but economic ones.\n\n“The other party right now is so unpredictable,” said Rhett Buttle, an entrepreneur and advocate. “I think it’s a question of stability in business, and normal rule-making, or potentially chaotic markets.”\n\nIn courting the business community, Democrats have a steep hill to climb. The GOP broadly supports an agenda of low taxes and light regulation.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s big-spend infusions into the U.S. economy have been welcomed by some industries, he and other Democrats have taken a more aggressive tone towards large companies, blaming corporate greed for some of Americans’ affordability issues. Vice President Kamala Harris recently announced a proposal to ban price-gouging in the food and grocery industries.\n\nDaniella Ballou-Aares leads the Leadership Now Project, a business group focused on “protecting American democracy.” She said executives are split between the two parties, and argued the prospect of an authoritarian turn is making some in that group nervous.\n\n“Do business leaders like all Democratic policies? No,” she said. “But are they scared of a leader who’s gonna go after his enemies, and reward his friends, and turn us into a banana republic? Turns out they don’t like that.”\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nKlobuchar: 'There is a lot of competition about competition'\n\nDuring the Republican National Convention last month, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s support for anti-monopoly measures set off a flurry of messaging from Democrats, as they sought to reassure voters that they, not the GOP, are the party of workers and economic progressivism.\n\nSpeaking in Chicago on Thursday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar suggested those shifting fault lines could be a good thing for antitrust-minded Democrats.\n\n“There is a lot of competition about competition,” Klobuchar said. “When you look through history, that actually is what’s gotten things going. … When you’ve got some buy-in from both sides.”\n\nVance, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee, has praised the current Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, who is controversial even among Democrats for her strong anti-monopoly intervention.\n\nSo far, Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled she will embrace a populist economic platform, arguing large corporations have helped drive Americans’ affordability issues. Though key details of her platform remain in flux: some of Harris' big donors have been pushing her to replace Khan.\n\n– Laura Gersony\n\nMaggot probe continues in Chicago\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether saboteurs put insects into a breakfast buffet for delegates at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, sickening one person.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling declined to discuss specifics of the investigation at the Fairmont Chicago hotel. Last month, Gaza war activists released insects at the Watergate hotel in Washington, D.C. in an effort to disrupt the stay of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOne witness staying at the Fairmont told USA TODAY the insects appeared to be crickets, while other news reports suggested maggots. Officials indicated the contamination happened around 6:45 a.m., and witnesses said all the food had been replaced within an hour.\n\nRead more on the ongoing investigation.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nWho is performing at the DNC? The Chicks expected to sing the national anthem\n\nThe Chicks, the country music group formerly known as The Dixie Chicks, are expected to perform the national anthem for the final night of the Democratic convention. The group was seen doing a sound check at the United Center on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe appearance isn’t the group’s first foray into politics. In 2003, it’s lead singer Natalie Maines said during a concert that the band was “ashamed” that President George W.

When Georgia was called on to cast their votes, the cameras panned to Lil Jon atop the United Center stadium stairs in Chicago.\n\n\"YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHH,\" the Atlanta rapper said as the intro to \"Turn Down for What,\" played on the speaker.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nMuslim Women for Harris-Walz disbands\n\nThe group Muslim Women for Harris-Walz announced it is disbanding after the campaign refused a request from the uncommitted movement to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"We cannot in good conscience continue Muslim Women for Harris-Walz,\" the group said in a statement. \"We pray that the DNC and VP Harris’ team makes the right decision before this convention is over. For the sake of each of us.”\n\nThe uncommitted movement has for months pushed Democratic leaders to implement an arms embargo to Israel and work toward a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. Delegates from the group organized a sit-in outside of the convention on Wednesday, saying they would stay put until Harris' campaign allowed a Palestinian speaker on stage.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat Shyamala Gopalan's legacy means to Kamala Harris\n\nIn the story of Kamala Harris’ life, her mother steals the show. The vice president would have it no other way.\n\n“Mommy, you are the star of this book because you are the reason for everything,” Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” “There is no title or honor on earth I’ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris’ daughter.”\n\nGopalan, a breast cancer researcher who died in 2009 at age 70 of colon cancer, won't see her daughter accept the Democratic Party’s nomination for president on Thursday, but she will be a strong presence.\n\nGopalan set out on her own across the world at the age of 19, defying her native culture. She raised two girls to identify both with her own background and one that was totally alien to her. She encouraged them to excel and exceed expectations but not leave others behind. And she did it all while performing important scientific work of her own.\n\nRead more on Harris and her mother's legacy in her life.\n\n— Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nDNC schedule Thursday: See full list of events, where to watch Democratic convention\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz visits home delegation, touts importance of today\n\nFresh off his convention floor speech, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joked with Minnesota Democrats that Thursday was an important day.\n\n\"Look, it's an important day. The eyes of the world are focused on this day because it's the day that the Minnesota State Fair opens up,\" Walz told delegates at the Fairmont Chicago.\n\nWalz thanked his home-state delegates for supporting him and his wife Gwen in recent weeks.\n\n\"We're ready to take the Minnesota values that you all taught us,\" Walz said. \"Everybody who I talk to across this country, when I talk to them, they want to be Minnesota.\"\n\n— Jessie Balmert\n\nWhat people are saying about Kamala Harris: 'A vibe I’m feeling'\n\nPolls suggest millions of Americans are changing their presidential voting plans with Harris currently topping the Democratic ticket, signing up for who she is and what they feel she represents.\n\nMany voters interviewed by USA TODAY find themselves surprised to be supporting the new Democratic candidate for president this year, swept up in the excitement and \"vibes\" of her campaign.\n\nThere are at least four distinct groups of Harris supporters: The Democrats who would have voted for whoever their party put at the top of the ticket; the Democrats who weren't sure they would have bothered to vote for Biden, but are enthusiastically behind Harris; the undecideds who have come down on the side of Harris; and the former Trump supporters who are excited about someone new.\n\nRead what Americans are saying about the Harris campaign.\n\n— Terry Collins, Deborah Barfield Berry and Trevor Hughes\n\nPoet Amanda Gorman, comedian Kenan Thompson among Wednesday highlights\n\nAmanda Gorman, the country's first national youth poet laureate, delivered a poem that drew applause and cheers from the audience at the Democratic convention on Wednesday night.\n\nGorman debuted a new poem called \"This Sacred Scene\".\n\n“Only now approaching this rare air are we aware that perhaps the American Dream is no dream at all, but instead a dare to dream together,” she said in one of her lines.\n\nComedian Kenan Thompson took the stage to continue criticizing Project 2025, a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation for potential new Republican administration, though Trump has continually denied association with the it.\n\n“You ever seen a document that can kill a small animal and democracy at the same time?” the comedian said while holding a large hardback copy of the project.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi, Amaris Ecinas and Savannah Kuchar\n\nKamala Harris ushers in a new Democratic era, stepping out of Biden shadow\n\nAs President Joe Biden gave a tearful goodbye to the Democratic Party this week, a liberated Kamala Harris stepped out of his shadow and commandeered the national stage.\n\nThe handoff at the Democratic convention, one of several Biden farewells, was a visceral example of how the country is changing, with the first Black and Asian American woman topping a presidential ballot.\n\nNow, Harris has less than three months to convince the rest of America to entrust her with a four-year presidential term. She has raced to lay out an agenda that hits on Americans’ most pressing problems that excites the party’s base and is palatable to moderates.\n\nAfter years of quiet inroads on issues she cares about without undermining the president’s agenda, the pressure is on for Harris to provide a detailed vision of her own coming out of the party’s four-day gathering in Chicago.\n\nRead more as Harris prepares for her acceptance speech tonight.\n\n— Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump: I'd be 'honored' by Kennedy endorsement\n\nDonald Trump wouldn't say whether he has spoken with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in recent days, but made clear he would welcome an endorsement from the independent candidate.\n\n\"If he endorsed me, I would be honored by it — I would be very honored by it,\" Trump said during an early morning interview on \"Fox & Friends\" otherwise devoted to attacking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy during the Fox interview, quite a change from earlier this year when he denounced the independent candidate as a \"Radical Left Liberal\" whose candidacy would hurt him and help the Democrats.\n\nKennedy is expected to withdraw from the presidential race later this week.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nJewish Democrats have party loyalties tested in 2024 election\n\nJewish Democrats have had their party loyalties tested this election year as the left flank's support for the plight of the Palestinians has, at times, seemed to have taken on anti-Semitic undertones in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks and the subsequent Gaza war that's led to an estimated 40,000 Palestinian deaths.\n\nThe pushback from the left has been on display during protests at this week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Democrats nominated Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe split among Democrats and progressives over the war in Gaza is partly generational − with even some young Jewish Americans opposing Israel's war in Gaza. The right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has caused some younger Jewish Americans to push back at Israel.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll in March found that 42% of American Jews between the ages of 18 years old and 34 believe the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas is \"unacceptable.\" Only 27% of Jewish Americans ages 50 to 64 years old said it is \"unacceptable.\"\n\nRead more on the divisions facing some Democrats.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin\n\nGus Walz in Wednesday night's most touching moment: 'I love you, dad.'\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice-presidential running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has spoken openly and lovingly about his neurodivergent 17-year-old son Gus, who has ADHD, along with a non-verbal learning disorder and an anxiety disorder. Walz and his wife, Gwen, both former teachers, said recently in a statement to People magazine that they never considered Gus’ conditions an obstacle.\n\nWhen Walz delivered his acceptance speech inside the packed United Center arena Wednesday night, Gus watched from the audience with his mother and sister, Hope, and sobbed.\n\n“Hope, Gus and Gwen – you are my entire world, and I love you,” Walz said.\n\nGus Walz sprung from his seat, moved by his father's words.\n\nHe pointed his index finger, saying \"I love you, dad.\"\n\nRead more about Gus and how advocates for Americans with learning disabilities believe the Walz family's openness about their son and their willingness to speak publicly about the experience will raise much-needed visibility that could help others who are going through similar issues.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nWalz hometown view: Locals at DNC watch party cheer on their former football coach\n\nDemocratic National Convention highlights: Tim Walz makes everyman pitch\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz played up his role as the everyman on the Democratic ticket on Wednesday night by talking about his time as a high school teacher and coach while accepting his party's nomination for vice president.\n\nTaking the stage as the night's keynote speaker, Walz revved up the crowd by bragging about his policy record as governor. He talked up cutting prescription drug costs and establishing free school lunch for students while defending abortion rights and establishing firearm regulations. But the 60-year-old Democrat also underscored how the heart of his progressive values — and differences with the Republican ticket — are about respecting others.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday night:\n\n'A dad in plaid' Walz speech: Democrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing her home-state governor as a “dad in plaid.” They even brought out former students and football players on the stage sporting jerseys while playing up his military service (which has come under attack by the GOP). The message was clearly aimed at Midwest voters across the blue wall, particularly in rural white working-class areas where Democrats have struggled.\n\nDemocrats went into overdrive to convey that Walz is a regular small-town dude living down the road, with Minnesota Sen.

Bill Clinton's complicated legacy with modern Democrats: In the 1990s, William Jefferson Clinton was the boss of the Democratic Party, and considered one of the best political communicators of the age. the former president is still thought of fondly by a segments of the party who believe he could be an asset this cycle. Still showcasing the 42nd president could also backfire and aggravate younger generations of Democrats, who find it hard reconcile with Clinton's tenure scarred by an extramarital affair with an intern.

The move comes over a year after Microsoft (MSFT) first announced its intention to phase out IE from products.\n\nIt marks the final goodbye for a browser that has been on the way out for years. In August 2020, for example, Microsoft’s workplace chat software Teams stopped working with IE, and its 365 apps (including Office) no longer worked on IE as of mid-summer 2021.\n\nFor the next several months, users who click the IE icon will be redirected to Microsoft Edge, the company’s newer answer to web browsing, in “IE mode.” IE mode allows users to access older, Internet Explorer-based websites and applications from Edge. Eventually, Microsoft plans on releasing a Windows Update that will remove all IE icons from devices.\n\n“The web has evolved and so have browsers,” Sean Lyndersay, General Manager of Microsoft Edge Enterprise, said in the blog post Wednesday. “Incremental improvements to Internet Explorer couldn’t match the general improvements to the web at large, so we started fresh.”\n\nIE’s retirement impacts all currently supported versions of Windows 10 Home, Pro, Enterprise, Edu and IoT.\n\nOnce the most-popular web browser, Internet Explorer had been on a steady decline for nearly two decades. After debuting in 1995 as part of Windows 95 and becoming an instant hit, the browser enjoyed a virtual monopoly throughout the early 2000s. At its 2002 peak, Internet Explorer commanded 95% of the browser market.\n\nBut Microsoft let IE 6 flounder for five years with no new version, pushing customers to other, more up-to-date browser options. IE soon became known for its bugs, security issues and slow tech, and its share of the browser market fell below the 50% threshold in 2010. In the first four months of 2022, the browser sat at about 1.8%, according to browser usage tracker NetMarketShare. Google (GOOG)’s Chrome is the browser leader, commanding 73% of the market.\n\nIn its announcement last year, Microsoft said Internet Explorer is slow, no longer practical for or compatible with many modern web tasks, and is far less secure than modern browsers.", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn David Goldman", "Jennifer Korn", "David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/business/saudi-hajj-economy-mime-intl", "title": "The Hajj is back and Saudi Arabia is hoping to cash in | CNN Business", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nOil has added trillions of dollars to Saudi Arabia’s coffers over the decades, but it’s a resource that will someday run out or lose value as the world turns to alternative energy.\n\nDespite current high oil prices, the kingdom knows this, and it has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. One of those sources is the pilgrimage, an eternal monopoly that has a potential market of almost two billion Muslims.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\n“Unlike [the energy sector], where Saudi Arabia always has to worry about future competitors, in the area of Hajj and Umrah, they are guaranteed to have zero competition in perpetuity,” said Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain-based Derasat think tank.\n\nMuslims from the world over return to Saudi Arabia this week to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage after a two-year hiatus caused by Covid-19 restrictions. It’s an opportunity for Muslims to fulfill a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation, but also a chance for the economy of Saudi Arabia’s holy cities to get a jump start.\n\nThe pandemic caused the number of Hajj pilgrims to dwindle to 1,000 in 2020, but it rose to about 60,000 in 2021, when the Hajj was opened only to residents of Saudi Arabia. This year, the kingdom authorized one million Muslims to perform the rites.\n\nExperts say that with crude oil prices hovering around $100 a barrel, generating billions of dollars a day, the pilgrimage’s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\n“Religious tourism in Saudi Arabia may not have the current revenue-generating capacity of the oil and gas sector, but the religious significance of Mecca and Medina will never run dry,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It serves as a crucial foundation to build out the broader Saudi tourism sector and market it to local, regional, and international audiences.”\n\nThe potential for expansion is significant, says Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics. Pilgrims could, for example, be incentivized to extend their trips in the country to visit other religious sites or engage in recreation, particularly during the year-round minor pilgrimage, the Umrah, where Hajj-related bottlenecks can be avoided, he said.\n\nAccording to Mastercard’s latest Global Destination Cities Index, Mecca attracted $20 billion in tourist dollars in 2018, second only to Dubai.\n\nBefore the pandemic, pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis by 2022. That was when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, according to official data cited by Reuters.\n\nThe number of pilgrims has shrunk significantly during the pandemic but the government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030, which some analysts have said is an ambitious figure.\n\nThe pilgrimage has been a drain on the government’s finances due to the cost of infrastructure, maintenance, and security, according to Hertog, but it has made big money for the private sector.\n\nMecca’s skyline around the millennia-old pilgrimage site is crowded with swanky skyscrapers housing Western hotel chains overlooking the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure Muslims turn to in prayer five times a day. A night at the iconic Fairmont Makkah Clock Royal Tower, which overlooks the Kaaba, costs up to $4,000 for its most opulent suites for this year’s Hajj season.\n\nBut the government has been trying to get a slice of that cake. In two years, the state-owned Public Investment Fund plans to open the Rou’a Al Haram Al Makki project just under a mile from the Kaaba, with 70,000 new hotel rooms and 9,000 residential units. It is expected to contribute 8 billion riyals ($2.1 billion) to the Saudi economy.\n\nIn a blow to private travel agencies abroad that organize pilgrimages for Muslims in the West, the Saudi government this year announced a new booking platform that obliges foreign pilgrims to register and pay for the process directly through the new government-run system called “Motawif.”\n\nThe system is designed to streamline the application process, but it has put travel agencies abroad out of business. In the United Kingdom alone, the sector is worth approximately $240 million, and many Hajj operators there are now facing liquidation, according to the Independent newspaper.\n\nSaudi authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment.\n\nThe only threat to Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to capitalize on the pilgrimage “is decreasing religiosity across the world,” said Al-Ubaydli. “But as long as Muslims continue to want to visit these sites, they will represent massive economic opportunities to Saudi Arabia.”\n\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report\n\nThe digest\n\nIran is adding demands to nuclear talks, US says\n\nIran added “unrelated” demands to the discussion table during the last round of talks on its nuclear program, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said on Tuesday in an interview with National Public Radio, adding that and it has made “alarming” progress in its uranium enrichment field that would allow it to make a nuclear weapon “in a matter of weeks.”\n\nBackground: The last round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US took place in Doha, Qatar last week, and were mediated by the European Union. The talks were the latest hope at getting both sides to an agreement that would revive a 2015 nuclear deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear weapon abilities. The two-day talks came to a standstill, however, with Malley describing them as “a wasted occasion.”\n\nWhy it matters: Iran is inching closer to the amount of enrichment necessary to make a nuclear bomb, with Malley saying it would only take them “a matter of weeks” to reach one. “They are going to have to decide sooner or later,” said Malley, “Because at some point the deal will be a thing of the past.”\n\nBen & Jerry’s sues Unilever to block sale of Israeli business\n\nBen & Jerry’s is suing its parent company in an attempt to cancel the sale of its business in Israel to a local partner that would continue to distribute its products in the West Bank.\n\nBackground: The Vermont-based ice cream maker filed a complaint Tuesday in the US District Court in New York, where it sought an injunction against Unilever “to protect the brand and social integrity Ben & Jerry’s has spent decades building.” Last week, Unilever announced that it had sold Ben & Jerry’s Israeli business for an undisclosed amount to American Quality Products (AQP), which distributes the ice cream in Israel.\n\nWhy it matters: Since 2021, Ben & Jerry’s has been fiercely opposed to the sale of its products in the West Bank, saying that it would be “inconsistent with” the brand. Ben & Jerry’s has been doing business in Israel since 1987, but in recent years it had come under pressure for selling in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law.\n\nNazi war criminal Eichmann heard boasting of role in Holocaust in audio recordings\n\nAudio recordings have emerged of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann boasting about his role in the Holocaust. The recordings, carried out in 1957, have Eichmann hailing his part in the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jewish people.\n\nBackground: Eichmann was captured by Israeli secret agents in Argentina in 1960 and brought to Israel where he was put on trial for crimes against humanity. In his defense he argued that he was only following orders, and that the key decisions were taken by other, more senior, Nazi leaders. Eichmann was convicted at his trial and put to death in 1962.\n\nWhy it matters: The recordings, which have been lying in a German archive for decades, have been aired for the first time as part of a new documentary about Eichmann called “The Devil’s Confession.” He can be heard saying that it would defy his innermost beliefs to deny that the Nazis did something wrong. “If we had killed 10.3 million Jews, I would say with satisfaction, ‘Good, we destroyed an enemy.’ Then we would have fulfilled our mission,” he said.\n\nAround the region\n\nTunisian tennis player Ons Jabeur made history on the grass courts of Wimbledon Tuesday as she became the first Arab woman to reach the semifinals of a grand slam.\n\nThe world No. 3 overcame a nervy start to rally from a set down and beat Marie Bouzková 3-6 6-1 6-1 on Centre Court.\n\nAfter reaching the final four, she said it had been a long time coming for her personally.\n\n“I was hoping that I could get to this stage for a long time already. I struggled a few times in the quarterfinal,” Jabeur told the media afterwards.\n\n“I was talking a little bit to (former world No. 22) Hicham Arazi, and he told me: ‘Arabs always lose in the quarterfinals and we are sick of it. Please break this,’” she added.\n\nThe 27-year-old will face fellow first-time semifinalist Tatjana Maria for a spot in the final.\n\nBy Ben Morse\n\nTime capsule\n\nTroops from the National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the National Liberation Front, marching in the district of Medea in Algiers, Algeria, in September 1962. Dominique Berretty/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images\n\nAlgeria this week marked 60 years since its independence from France following a bloody war of independence whose wounds are yet to heal.\n\nFrance began its rule of Algeria in 1830. The city of Algiers was originally taken by the French as a military measure, but as more settlers began arriving with French protection, France’s boundaries continued to advance.\n\nIn 1954, the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) was formed as a guerilla group to liberate the country from its colonizer. It started an uprising that took the next seven years, known as the Algerian War, which led to Tunisia and Morocco being granted independence by France in return for militarizing their borders with Algeria.\n\nOn March 16, 1962, an agreement was signed in France promising Algeria independence pending a national referendum and on July 5, Algeria celebrated its independence from France.\n\nFollowing its independence, most of the one million Europeans returned to their countries. More than 100,000 Muslims were killed in the seven-year Algerian war. Algeria says that over 5.6 million were killed over 130 years of colonization. French President Emanuel Macron last year accused Algeria of “rewriting history,” prompting the North African nation to recall its ambassador in Paris. To this day, France has not apologized for its role in Algeria’s colonization. There will be “no repentance nor apologies,” Macron’s office said last year.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary", "authors": ["Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/12/09/manhunt-suspect-brian-thompson-killing-updates/76857886007/", "title": "UnitedHealthcare CEO killing: Suspect charged with murder", "text": "Editor's note: This page is a summary of news on the arrest of Luigi Mangione in connection with the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson for Monday, Dec. 9. For news updates on the investigation, visit USA TODAY's article on the arrest of Luigi Mangione for Tuesday, Dec. 10.\n\nA Maryland man arrested at a McDonald's restaurant with what police say was a gun and silencer made with a 3-D printer was charged Monday night with murder and other felonies in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City.\n\nA criminal complaint filed by police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, also charged Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, with forgery, tampering with records or identification, giving police false ID, and possessing instruments of a crime. He was arraigned and jailed without bail.\n\nAuthorities said they found a 3D-printed handgun and a silencer when they searched Mangione's backpack upon detaining him at the McDonald's. The police officers, responding to a restaurant employee's tip, said they recognized Mangione right away from widely distributed law enforcement photos once he removed his face mask upon their request.\n\n\"We just didn’t think twice about it,\" rookie officer Tyler Frye said at a night news conference. \"We knew that was our guy.’’\n\nAccording to the complaint, Mangione presented a fake New Jersey driver's license when first approached by officers, who said he grew silent and started shaking when they asked if he had recently been in New York City.\n\nThe evening proceedings capped a dramatic day when authorities got a big break with the worker's morning call after searching for Thompson's killer since he was gunned down outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel early Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro commended the worker while chastising those who have celebrated Thompson’s killing because of frustration with health care insurance companies.\n\n\"In some dark corners, this killer is being hailed as a hero,\" Shapiro said. \"Hear me on this: He is no hero.

Nino Mangione released a statement on behalf of the family after the arrest Monday night.\n\n\"We only know what we have read in the media,\" Nino Mangione said in the statement, posted on X. \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n\nThe Baltimore-area family issued the statement before New York City prosecutors charged Mangione with murder. The 26-year-old is currently being held in Pennsylvania but is expected to be extradited to New York.\n\nThe targeted killing of the health care executive and the ensuing dayslong manhunt for a suspect has quickly spread the Mangione name around America. But in Baltimore, the family is better known for their contributions to the area.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Michael Loria, Chris Kenning, and Charles Ventura\n\nBusted for fake ID: How authorities nabbed Luigi Mangione\n\nAltoona police arriving at a local McDonald’s on a tip asked a man resembling the United Healthcare CEO shooter if he had been to New York recently and when they did he grew quiet and began to shake, according to a criminal complaint in the arrest of Mangione.\n\nMangione, the person of interest in the killing of Thompson, was at the McDonald’s when a customer spied him and reported him to an employee who then called police, state police said at a news conference Monday evening. Mangione was wearing the signature blue surgical mask the shooter was wearing in New York City surveillance footage and seated at the back of the restaurant using a laptop, the Altoona Police Department complaint added.\n\nPolice discovered the identification card Mangione produced — for a Mark Rosario of New Jersey — was fake, at which point he identified himself, according to the criminal complaint. Law enforcement found a black 3D-printed pistol and silencer in Mangione’s backpack, according to charging documents.\n\nFrye, six months on the job, said Mangione \"was very cooperative.\" Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania, according to Pennsylvania court documents.\n\nThe Altoona McDonald’s was the suspected killer’s latest stop in a several-day trek around Pennsylvania that included stop-overs in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, according to state police. New York City prosecutors are expected to file charges soon at which point Mangione could be extradited to Manhattan, said Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks.\n\nThe arrest came the same day Thompson was buried in Minnesota, according to officials.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nNYC police commissioner: Articles found on Mangione 'consistent' with items used by CEO's killer\n\nUpon announcing the arrest of a person of interest earlier Monday, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said a gun, silencer, mask, and fake identification card found on Mangione were \"consistent\" with items believed used by Thompson's killer.\n\n\"We have a strong person of interest in the shooting that shook our city,\" New York Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference. \"It was crucial that we were able to remove him off the streets of America.\"\n\nHandwritten papers found on Mangione \"speak to his motivation and mindset,\" Tisch said. Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said the three-page document included no other targets but expressed \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nMangione had a ghost gun, which can be assembled at home and is difficult to trace, Kenny said. The gun may have been made on a 3D printer and capable of firing a 9mm round, he added.\n\nAuthorities uncovered numerous videos and photos of the person of interest from which they developed a precise timeline for his escape from the shooting scene and flight from the city. Authorities said Mangione was raised in Maryland, went to college in Pennsylvania, and had a last known address in Honolulu.\n\nHere's what we know so far: Who is the man detained in UnitedHealthcare CEO's killing?\n\nGov. Shapiro: 'We are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice'\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro defended the Pennsylvania McDonald’s customer who identified the person of interest in the fatal shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO at a news conference Monday evening.\n\n\"In some dark corners this killer is being hailed as a hero,\" Shapiro said of Mangione. \"Hear me on this, he is no hero. The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald's this morning.\"\n\nShapiro’s defense of the customer comes after an outpouring of support online for Mangione, whom many have hailed as sticking up for Americans against the health insurance industry.\n\n“Some attention in this case, especially online, has been deeply disturbed as some want to celebrate this killer,” said Shapiro.\n\nThe arrest of the suspected killer comes just months after the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Shapiro shared he was deeply concerned about what he saw as a troubling trend in the nation.\n\n\"We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences,\" Shapiro said. \"I have no tolerance, nor should anyone for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he thinks his opinion matters most.\"\n\n\"In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice,\" said Shapiro.\n\n— Michael Loria\n\nGoogle pulls McDonald's negative reviews after arrest in UnitedHealth killing\n\nGoogle on Monday removed derogatory reviews about McDonald's after the suspect in the killing of a UnitedHealthcare executive was arrested at its restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where police say a customer alerted a local employee about him.\n\nThe negative comments aimed at McDonald's were the latest in what is known as \"review bombing,\" where an establishment is hit with a litany of bad reviews based on a political view or an occurrence unrelated to its actual business.\n\nIn this case, the negative and one-star reviews showed up after Mangione was captured at a McDonald’s in Altoona. He was spotted eating at the restaurant by a customer who alerted a McDonald's employee, state police said.\n\n\"These reviews violate our policies and have been removed,\" a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\n— Reuters\n\nMangione's path from valedictorian to person of interest\n\nA private school valedictorian. An Ivy League graduate. And now a person of interest in the killing of the United HealthCare CEO that's captured the attention of the nation.\n\nMangione — law enforcement’s person of interest captured in Pennsylvania — has an impressive resume and Ivy League education, with the kind of affluent and influential family ties that can often pave a path to a successful future. But now Mangione, who hasn't been charged in the crime, finds himself at the unlikely center of a murder investigation that has sparked a conversation around health care in the U.S. and how untraceable \"ghost guns\" and silencers can be assembled via a 3-D printer.\n\n\"Even early on the class of 2016 was challenging the world around it,\" says Mangione in his Gilman School valedictorian speech in Baltimore. \"The class of 2016’s inventiveness also stems from its incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mangione was personable, witty, and confident. The news of his arrest shocked the leaders of the prestigious schools he attended.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione’s suspected involvement in this case is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation,\" Gilman's Head of School Henry Smyth wrote in a statement. \"Here on campus, our focus will remain on caring for and educating our students.\" Read more here.\n\n— Michael Loria and Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nMagione appeared to approve of 'Unabomber' manifesto\n\nAn online post by a reviewer who appeared to be Mangione was highly supportive of a manifesto written by Ted Kaczynski, known as the \"Unabomber\" who killed three people and injured 23 in a series of mail bombings between 1978 and 1995.\n\nThe Goodreads review from January 2024 was written by a user with a profile name \"Luigi (lnmangione)\" and the same photo Mangione used in other social media profiles.\n\n“It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies,'' the reviewer said. \"But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\"\n\n— Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nWhat is a ‘ghost gun’ and are they legal?\n\nNew York City officials said early information indicated the firearm seized with Mangione was a so-called ‘ghost gun’ that may have been created on a 3D printer.\n\nThe term refers to un-serialized firearms that are manufactured at home with do-it-yourself kits. Critics of the firearms say they are problematic because they are not traceable like traditional firearms with serial numbers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has announced a federal rule to require manufacturers of the kits to perform background checks and mark the weapons with serial numbers – the same requirement of standard gun producers.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held arguments in October about the regulation, which could be struck down. The ruling would not impact the legality of \"privately made firearms\" by individuals, which are legal for personal use as long as they're not sold or transferred.\n\nThe number of suspected ghost guns recovered by law enforcement and submitted for tracing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives increased by more than 1,000% between 2017 and 2021. The number more than doubled from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAlumnus Mangione bringing unwanted attention to Penn\n\nOutside Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, reporters gathered and University of Pennsylvania students and West Philadelphia residents rushed by, but no one wanted to talk about Mangione, at least not on the record.\"No comment,\" a young man said brusquely as he walked into the brick twin house, past the red cups and a beer can on the porch. He let the door slam behind him. No one answered the bell.Penn student Paige Nolan said her father, who works near the scene of the shooting in Manhattan, called her when he heard the news. \"He was really curious and wondered who it was,\" Nolan said.\n\nNatasha Yajadda, also a student at the school, said she was surprised someone from an educated, privileged background “would take such violent action.”“It brings attention to the school, and not in a good way,” she said. Neither she nor Nolan, though, thought the alleged actions of one graduate would harm the prestigious university’s reputation.— Phaedra Trethan\n\nInvestigators hail crucial role of public in finding person of interest\n\nTisch, the police commissioner, said the tip from the McDonald's employee in Thompson's slaying is the third recent case in which the public has helped police. A tip also helped with the investigation of a recent triple stabbing in Manhattan and a gunpoint robbery in Queens, during which an NYPD officer was shot. Tisch said the tips \"led to the recovery of crucial evidence.”\n\n\"We should never underestimate the power of the public to be our eyes and ears in these investigations,\" Tisch said.\n\nWhile investigators recovered \"an enormous amount\" of forensic and video evidence in the case, Kenny told reporters Monday the lynchpin came after the release of the photos of the person of interest, which went viral on social media. Hundreds of tips poured in after authorities released the photos and offered $60,000 in reward money for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nIt's extremely common for the public to help police identify suspects in all kinds of crimes, which is why the relationship between the police and the community is so important, said Joe Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\"Considering how much money was on the table with the reward money, I mean, the whole country was looking for this guy. He had no friends,\" Giacalone said.\n\nEx-FBI profiler on the investigation: This is not a TV show\n\nFormer FBI profiler Mary Ellen O’Toole told USA TODAY on Monday that she was not surprised at the length of time the investigation took despite the scores of police and FBI agents working the case.\n\n“We expect these cases to be solved overnight, like they do in a TV show. But this is not TV and these cases take more time than that,\" O’Toole said.\n\nO'Toole said fake money from a Monopoly game found in the suspect's backpack had concerned her.\n\n\"He knew the police would find it,\" she said. \"If he thinks this is a game, he may not understand the egregiousness of what he has done. And he may have other targets.\"\n\nPressure on law enforcement to solve crime\n\nChristopher Dennison, an associate professor of sociology and criminology at the University at Buffalo, says the shooting prompted widespread discussion about inequities in the U.S. health care system that likely placed added pressure on authorities to solve the crime. But those pressures aside, time is always of the essence, he said.\n\n\"The chances of finding the offender significantly decrease as we get further away from the incident,\" Dennison said. \"In the end, the last thing anyone wants is for this case to turn into another D.B. Cooper.\"\n\nSuspect was tracked to a bus station\n\nThompson, 50, was shot Wednesday on a Midtown street outside a hotel where he was set to speak at an investment conference. Surveillance cameras show a shooter firing multiple times from behind Thompson at close range at about 6:45 a.m.\n\nPolice, primarily through surveillance cameras around the city, tracked the suspect's movement as he fled on foot before mounting an electric bike and riding into Central Park. He caught a cab around 7 a.m. on the Upper West Side and was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD's Kenny said.\n\nThe latest photos of the suspect, released late Saturday, appear to have been taken from a camera in the cab and show him wearing a blue medical mask and a hooded jacket. In one photo, he appears to be looking through the partition from the back seat; in the other photo, he is on the street.\n\nPreviously released photos have provided a relatively clear view of his face.\n\nTo them, slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was a local farm boy\n\nBrian Thompson's roots go back to rural Iowa\n\nTo the world, Thompson was the leader of a major corporation and a brilliant executive whose death last week ignited a massive manhunt. But residents of Hamilton County, Iowa, knew Thompson as a friend, neighbor and classmate. Thompson, 50, was raised on a farm between the small town of Jewell and the even tinier town of Stanhope and graduated from the communities' shared South Hamilton High School in 1993.\n\nTaylor Hill says he and Thompson grew close in their middle and high school years before Thompson left for college at the University of Iowa. They played golf, basketball and baseball together, trading sports cards and making mix tapes of the hits they listened to while growing up.\n\n\"He was one of the smartest kids, if not the smartest, and I would say the smartest person I've ever known,\" Hill said. \"He was probably smarter than half our teachers. And the thing with our teachers is they knew it, too.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Kyle Werner, Des Moines Register\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/05/12/new-restaurants-stores-2022-york-ogunquit-me-beaches/7362541001/", "title": "Maine beaches: Ogunquit and York restaurants, stores opening in ...", "text": "Max Sullivan\n\nnews@seacoastonline.com\n\nSummer 2022 will see a slate of new businesses open at York Beach, a new Pride week in Ogunquit and the return of some normalcy to some of the area’s most popular events.\n\nShort Sands Beach in York is seeing a new restaurant in Nick’s, as well as a new surf apparel shop.\n\nOgunquit will celebrate the 40th anniversary of its founding this year, two years belated due to coronavirus.

He said renovations to the ViewPoint and his other hotel, the Nevada, will take place over the course of the next year and will be ready for 2023.\n\nYork Region Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Holly Roberts said this summer is expected to be busy. She said she’s already fielding calls from tourists looking for help in booking rooms at popular hotels like the Anchorage Inn, Union Bluff, York Harbor Inn and the Stage Neck Inn.\n\n“Last year it was absolutely crazy around here.

He said he is looking forward to the coming season for tours and private events, however, recently posting a selfie on his Facebook page last week at the front of a bus packed with wedding guests.

The ride will be open to guests later this spring. Also new to the Playland will be the Monopoly Roll-‘N-Go, T-Rex Laser, Nitro Trucks, and King Kong of Skull Island, a new virtual reality game.\n\n“We love bringing new thrills and excitement to our guests as we celebrate 120 years of providing quality family fun at New England’s only beachfront amusement park,” said Paul Golder, the park’s president.\n\nBody, art and soul:: INKremental Tattoo Studio coming to York\n\nThe rides at Palace Playland will first operate on weekends only, then go daily starting June 17.\n\nPlayland’s Arcade, which has over 200 games ranging from vintage to state-of-the-art, is already open for the season on weekends and will open daily starting June 10.\n\nThe park will also continue its tradition of having fireworks on the beach every Thursday at 9:45 p.m. weather permitting.\n\nOgunquit Beach celebrates 40th birthday, first Pride event\n\nA 40th-anniversary bash was set for 2020 to commemorate Ogunquit’s 1980 separation from Wells as its own municipality, but the coronavirus pandemic hampered those plans.\n\n“This is our 40th-anniversary party that’s been three years in the making,” said Ogunquit Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Alice Pearce.\n\nBonaire, a celebration of Ogunquit, will take place June 11 in a closed-off section of Shore Road. Pearce said the day will celebrate three areas of pride for Ogunquit – music, its fishing heritage and its LGBTQ+ community.\n\nLive music will take place on a stage all day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. with the Mallet Brothers from Portland headlining. Adjacent to the music area will be a traveling circus group set up in the Ogunquit Village School playground, and an art walk will take place starting from Perkins Cove to the downtown. There will also be an LGBTQ+ history scavenger hunt, and fireworks.\n\n“It’s going to be a huge day,” Pearce said.\n\nThe chamber is also introducing a new LGBTQ+ Pride week from June 1-5, which will kick off with a pride flag raising at Veteran’s Park, followed by a barbecue. Maine Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau will speak at the opening ceremony. The following night will feature a pride night at Ogunquit Playhouse, and Pearce said the chamber is finalizing plans for an arts festival. Sunday will feature a drag brunch hosted by Nikanos.\n\nPearce said some of the local hotels have been preparing for the 2022 season with renovations, like the Blue Shutters Inn and the Sea Chambers Motel. Also new this year is the Batson River Fish Camp, a restaurant opened by the owners of the Batson River Brewing and Distilling.\n\nMr. Gay Ogunquit returns\n\nMaine Street Bar has been hosting Mr. Gay Ogunquit for about 20 years each Labor Day Weekend, but the event goes back much further than that, according to Maine Street Bar co-owner Eddie Gayhart.\n\n“It used to be called the Gay Speedo Contest,” said Gayhart, referring to the days when the contest was run by The Club. When that popular spot closed down, Gayhart said Maine Street picked it up and gave it a new name out of respect to The Club’s years of stewardship.\n\n“It’s something that’s been carried on,” Gayhart said. The annual contest has contestants line up in Speedos down by the gay section of the beach, “Section G,” introduced one by one.\n\nSplash into spring: Ogunquit kicks off season with fair, Patriotic Pooch Pageant and more\n\n“They have to do a little dance in their Speedo, run down to the water, jump in the water, come back,” Gayhart said. Categories include “Best Basket,” “Best Arms,” “Best Legs,” “Best Chest,” and overall best. Judges then rate each contestant from 1 to 10, and around 6 p.m. the new Mr. Gay Ogunquit is named at Maine Street.\n\nThe event has drawn contestants from around the world during one of Ogunquit’s busiest weekends.\n\n“It’s a tradition, and I enjoy doing it,” said Gayhart. “People who come to Ogunquit know what it is, and they look forward to it.”\n\nYork Days to feature sailing championship\n\nYork Days returns from July 29 through Aug. 7 with activities and events throughout the nine days, this year including the Maine State Sailing Championships Aug. 1 and 2.\n\nThe York-based Agamenticus Yacht Club won first place in the 2021 contest, meaning their hometown gets to host the following year’s event.\n\n“We don’t host a regatta often, so that’s pretty exciting,” said Liz Cooper, special events coordinator for the York Parks and Recreation that puts on York Days.\n\nThis year will see a return to some normalcy for York Days since the coronavirus pandemic affected public gatherings in 2020. She said it will be the first time in a couple years that a movie will be played on Long Sands Beach to kick off York Days.\n\n“Pre-COVID we had those on the beach, had two to three hundred people,” Cooper said. “I’m excited for that to go back to normal.”\n\nBeach Bum Threads: York surf-inspired clothing store opens at Short Sands Beach\n\nYork Days offers a wide range of activities each year, like the annual York Days 5K on July 31.\n\nJuly 30 will feature the Plein Air Paint Out, in which artists paint pieces while outdoors at Mount Agamenticus. Cooper said she is also excited for the York Days Craft Fair, scheduled for Aug. 6 and 7 and which has grown each year from 50 vendors one year, then 60, then 70.\n\nAlso on the menu is \"Christmas in July,\" for which the historic Nubble Lighthouse will be lit up with white Christmas lights, and holiday music will be played July 31.\n\nParks and Recreation takes over Beach Bonfire event\n\nLabor Day weekend will see a two-decade tradition return under new management, as Walter and Jennifer Woods of Graystone Builders of Maine have turned over the Beach Bonfire benefit to the town Parks and Recreation.\n\nThe Bonfire, set for Sept. 3, was first launched 20 years ago to raise money for the New York Fire Department in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The excitement and success of the bonfire inspired and motivated the Woods family to make the event a tradition to raise money for different charities and foundations. Since the first year, the bonfire has raised more than $100,000 for those charities.\n\nNubble Lighthouse art: Teen's artwork of Maine landmark draws raves\n\nNow, the Woods have decided to pass the torch to Parks and Recreation, allowing them to take a break while keeping the tradition alive. Parks and Recreation will be partnering with the York Community Service Association to raise money for the YCSA’s Food Pantry. The bonfire will feature live entertainment, delicious concessions and raffles with the bonfire and grills igniting at 6 p.m. The festivities last until 10 p.m., or when the food sells out.\n\n“I was really excited to be asked and approached,” Cooper said. “It was an easy ‘yes,’ but not only is it a fun event. It brings the community together.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/economy/2023/08/05/arizonans-speak-out-proposed-kroger-albertsons-attorney-general-kris-mayes/70521366007/", "title": "Planned Kroger-Albertsons merger brings worry over prices, jobs ...", "text": "When grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons announced their blockbuster $24.6 billion merger proposal last year, the companies listed about a dozen potential benefits for customers, workers, shareholders and others.\n\nBut most of these possibly positive elements have been lost in the debate as critics focus instead on what they think could go wrong − including store closures, job losses and rising food prices.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/05"}]}
