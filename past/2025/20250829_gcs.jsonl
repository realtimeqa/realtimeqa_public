Last year, they rode every new coaster that opened across the U.S. and hope to do the same this year.\n\n\"I know, it's an obsession,\" Derek laughed. \"People think, 'What's wrong with you?' But it makes me so happy.\" And they aren't alone.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

What you should know if you're worried about accidents\n\nEarly memories\n\n\"I remember one time being a kid, there was an amusement park book, and our mom would read us pages from it like as a bedtime story,\" Derek said with a smile. He still loves park statistics. \"We just retained all this information.\"\n\n\"Then I remember I was talking to my mom one day about EPCOT and the different countries that have (pavilions), and she was like, 'If you focused this much on your school work, you'd be getting straight A's,' \" he added. \"But my passion was theme parks.\"\n\nTurning point\n\nThe brothers vividly recall their first \"big rides\" at around age 10. They were at Six Flags Great Adventure, the first stop of theme park road trip, which also included Hershey Park, Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Williamsburg.\n\n\"We're looking at these big rollercoasters, and we're thinking, 'We don't want to go on, and we're too scared to go on.' Do you remember?\" Derek said, turning to Doug, who immediately agreed. \"And our parents said, 'Well, if you're not going to ride the big rides, we can just go to museums for the rest of the trip.' \"\n\n\"They're not going to spend all this money going to these theme parks,\" Doug chimed in. Even back then, tickets weren't cheap, but nowadays, the starting price for daily park admission ranges from $39.99 at Kings Dominion, with its Early Days Deal, to $109 at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\n\"And we're kids,\" Doug said. \"We don't want to spend our summer vacation in museums, so that forced us on the rides. And as soon as we did go on the big rides, we fell in love.\"\n\nBeing a kid again\n\n\"When you're on a coaster, for me, I'm not thinking about anything else. All my cares from the world, from the day, they go away, and I'm just living in the moment, which is hard to do nowadays,\" Derek said. \"For theme parks, same thing. It reminds me of being a kid and just being blissful and happy.\"\n\n\"I feel exactly the same way, and I just love that fake fantasy world and just the themes,\" Doug chuckled. \"It's an escape.\"\n\nDream jobs\n\nWhen the brothers were 16, they got jobs at Rocky Point Park, a Rhode Island amusement park that opened in the 1840s and shuttered in the 1990s.\n\n\"We just loved being in the park and you know, we would do anything,\" Derek said. The jobs included operating games and giving guests temporary tattoos. \"And we would ride as much as possible, even if we weren't supposed to.\"\n\nHe said one rainy day with low attendance, they rode the Corkscrew roller coaster, their first upside-down roller coaster, over 30 times in a row. \"Surprisingly, we didn't get sick,\" he said. \"We just had the time of our lives.\"\n\nThey began traveling on their own for coasters in college and got really into it after moving from Rhode Island to California.\n\nReal jobs\n\nNowadays, Derek and Doug are DJs and music producers. \"I'm thinking about music and coasters all the time,\" Derek said. Whenever they travel to new cities for gigs, they try to ride roller coasters nearby.\n\nThey'd hoped to ride Dr. Diabolical’s Cliffhanger, which is billed as the \"world's steepest dive coaster,\" when they DJed at Six Flags Fiesta Texas' Pride event last June, but it wasn't open yet.\n\n\"We did go back,\" Derek laughed. \"It was the end of October, and Doug was like, 'You know we've been on pretty much every new roller coaster that opened this year. We haven't been on Dr. Diabolical. It's a shame we can't get on it.' So for our birthday, we planned a trip to go ride Dr. Diabolical.\" They did wind up riding every new coaster in the U.S. last year, making special trips for most of them.\n\nPark tips How can I get the most out of my Disneyland trip?

Doug has ridden over 1,100.\n\n\"For Derek, there's no coaster too small. He will travel – and we have – hours and hours out of our way for some kiddie coaster that's considered a (coaster) credit because he counts all his coasters,\" Doug said with a laugh.\n\n\"If I fit, I sit; like a cat in a box,\" Derek laughed. \"If I'm going to a kiddie coaster in South Dakota and I've never been to South Dakota, it forces me to go out and see this area of the country I haven't been to.\"\n\nSome roller coasters are the destination. Others are detours.\n\nCoaster community\n\nThe brothers aren't the only ones willing to go the distance. American Coaster Enthusiasts describes itself as the \"world's largest club of amusement ride enthusiasts,\" and many members are willing to travel for their shared love.\n\nDerek serves as the group's communications director. Doug joked that he's Derek's assistant, but he really helps with ACE's social media and other areas. \"It's like a full-time job, but it's all volunteer,\" he said.\n\nDerek and Doug have met some of their closest friends through ACE events, which include exclusive ride times on attractions before or after theme parks open to the public.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true being at a park when there aren't lines, and you can just sit on a roller coaster and go on it over and over and over and try all the different seats,\" Derek said, joking that their early Rocky Point days prepared them for that.\n\nFavorite roller coasters\n\nDerek says his favorite roller coaster is \"always the roller coaster that I'm currently riding,\" but noted appreciation for traditional coasters like Leap-the-Dips, which Lakemont Park bills as the \"oldest wooden roller coaster in the world,\" and newer ones like VelociCoaster at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\n\"Maybe Derek's are off the record,\" Doug laughed. \"I have so many.\" Doug's favorites include Superman at Six Flags New England, Iron Gwazi at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, X2 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland just outside Toronto.\n\n\"For me, Hershey Park has the best collection of roller coasters, and now they're getting a new roller coaster this year,\" he added. \"Busch Gardens Williamsburg is my favorite park overall. I have so many memories there.\"\n\nDoes Disney have military discounts?

The summer before the stroke, they got in one last big road trip all together with visits to Six Flags St. Louis, Silver Dollar City and Hershey Park.\n\n\"After our dad had his stroke, for me, it's kind of like I don't want to miss any opportunity because I never know when I won't be able to do something,\" Derek said. \"So even though I might not want to travel those two hours to go to that little coaster or get up at four in the morning and go to a roller coaster, I just do it because I know I'm going to make such good memories.\"\n\nNow the brothers FaceTime or call their parents from parks. \"It's like they're there as much as they can be, but it brings back like all the memories of being a kid,\" Derek said. \"But yeah, our mom loves roller coasters, and I feel like she lives vicariously now, through what we're doing.\"\n\nAnd \"we do have our coaster enthusiast friends now to go on these big epic trips with,\" Doug added.\n\nRoller coaster tips", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/theme-parks/2025/03/04/new-roller-coasters-2025-opening/81141317007/", "title": "Roller coaster fans are ready to ride these new record breakers", "text": "AI-assisted summary Theme parks across the U.S. are introducing a variety of new roller coasters in 2025, featuring record-breaking speeds, heights, and unique elements.\n\nSome highly anticipated coasters include Siren's Curse at Cedar Point, Stardust Racers at Universal Epic Universe, and Rapterra at Kings Dominion.\n\nFamily-friendly coasters like Snoopy's Racing Railway at Carowinds and Beach Rescue Racer at SeaWorld San Antonio will offer thrilling experiences for all ages.\n\nGet ready for your heart to leap into your throat.\n\nA new wave of record-setting roller coasters opens this year at theme parks across the U.S.\n\n“I'm thrilled about the lineup,” said Derek Perry, communications director for American Coaster Enthusiasts, the world’s largest club for fans of amusement rides.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nStardust Racers at Universal Epic Universe\n\n“Top of the list, number one, Epic Universe Stardust Racers,” proclaimed Martina “Prime” Moore, a self-described adrenaline junkie and founder CEO of Melanin Coaster Network, a club created for coaster enthusiasts of color but open to everyone. “You get to duel with your friends.”\n\nLike its beloved predecessor, Dueling Dragons at Universal Islands of Adventure, Stardust Racers will be a dueling coaster with separate, intertwining tracks, allowing guests to race against each other.\n\nAt night, the illuminated cars are designed to look like comets zipping through the sky, on tracks without external lighting.\n\n“It looks like an awesome ride,” Moore said. “Lots of air time.”\n\nStardust Racers is one of several new coasters coming to Universal’s new theme park.\n\nOpening: May 22\n\nLocation: Orlando, Florida\n\nTop speed: 62 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 5,000 feet\n\nRide’s height: 133 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 48 inches\n\nSiren’s Curse at Cedar Point\n\nSiren’s Curse will be one of the first tilt coasters in the U.S., and Cedar Point is billing it as the tallest, longest and fastest tilt coaster in North America.\n\n“I've never experienced a roller coaster like that, so I'm anticipating that I'll be scared of it,” Perry admitted. “But I also want to ride it over and over ... I think it's going to be like unlike anything else that people have experienced before.”\n\nPoint-of-view video released by Cedar Point shows the ride vehicle ascending a long lift hill, then appearing to run out of track before tilting forward like a seesaw, “forcing you to peer straight down with the hope your train will connect to the twisted track below,” according to the park’s website.\n\n“I don't even know how engineering people come up with this stuff,” Moore said.\n\nOpening: Early summer\n\nLocation: Sandusky, Ohio\n\nTop speed: 58 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 2,966 feet\n\nRide’s height: 160 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 48 inches\n\nCedar Point fans are also looking forward to the reopening of Top Thrill 2, which closed for a mechanical modification not long after debuting last year.\n\nA towering 420 feet tall, it’s billed as “the world’s tallest and fastest triple-launch strata coaster.\"\n\n“That ride experience is awesome,” Moore said, adding that he was among the first to ride it. “It launches you forward and back 120 miles per hour.”\n\nIt was among Perry’s favorites last year. When Top Thrill 2 reopens, he said, “It'll be like two brand new coasters for many people, which, you know, when does that ever happen at a park?”\n\nRapterra at Kings Dominion\n\nKings Dominion describes Rapterra as “the world’s tallest and longest launched wing coaster.”\n\n“We only have two in America: one at Holiday World and one that they're building at Kings Dominion,” Moore said.\n\nOn a winged coaster, the seats extend out from both sides of the track like wings.\n\n“And then you have a launch. You're not going up a traditional lift hill,” Moore said. “Coaster fans, we love launches.”\n\nThe park says the coaster will go from 0 to 65 miles per hour in 4 seconds.\n\nOpening: 2025\n\nLocation: Doswell, Virginia\n\nTop speed: 65 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 3,086 feet\n\nRide’s height: 145 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: Not listed\n\nFire Runner at The Lost Island\n\nFire Runner will be “Iowa’s first single rail coaster,” according to The Lost Island Themepark.\n\nThe Iowa park may not be as well-known as some others, but Perry said, “The theming is incredible, especially for a family (owned) park ... They have this dark ride Volkanu that’s like almost to like a Universal, Disney level with the theming, and it's fantastic.”\n\nHe’s visited the park every year since it opened in 2022 and is already looking forward to going back for Fire Runner, which the park says is “inspired by the thrill of fire and speed.”\n\nOpening: 2025\n\nLocation: Waterloo, Iowa\n\nTop speed: 52 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 1,950 feet\n\nRide’s height: 92 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 48 inches\n\nWrath of Rakshasa at Six Flags Great America\n\nWrath of Rakshasa will be the “the steepest and most inverted dive coaster in the world,” according to Six Flags Great America. It will feature five inversions and “a cliffhanger hold, which suspends riders as they face straight down a 96-degree, beyond-vertical drop,” according to a park press release.\n\n“We love a good dive coaster,” Moore said. “It's like you're diving into the earth from the clouds.”\n\nOpening: 2025\n\nLocation: Gurnee, Illinois\n\nTop speed: Nearly 67 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 3,239 feet\n\nRide’s height: 180 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: Not listed\n\nQuantum Accelerator at Six Flags New England\n\nQuantum Accelerator will be “New England’s first dual-launch straddle coaster,” according to Six Flags New England. Perry said it will also be Six Flags’ first to feature this particular style of seating.\n\n\"You’re going to ride on a motorbike-type thing, kind of like Hagrid’s at Islands of Adventure ... DarKoaster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg or Arctic Rescue at SeaWorld San Diego,” he said. Those rides are all made by Intamin.\n\nHe called Quantum Accelerator a family thrill coaster. Unlike smaller kiddie coasters, family coasters are designed to be enjoyed by multiple generations, together.\n\nOpening: 2025\n\nLocation: Agawam, Massachusetts\n\nTop speed: 45 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 2,604 feet\n\nRide’s height: Not listed\n\nMinimum height to ride: 48 inches\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf: The Wolf’s Revenge at Busch Gardens Williamsburg\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf is coming back to Busch Gardens Williamsburg as The Big Bad Wolf: The Wolf’s Revenge.\n\nThe original Big Bad Wolf was a beloved suspended coaster that closed in 2009. The park says the new coaster will be “North America's longest family inverted coaster.”\n\nWith more than 2,500 feet of track, Moore said, “Coaster fans can enjoy a long family ride with our legs and feet blowing in the wind! Very excited for the rethemed and revamped attraction.”\n\nOpening: Spring\n\nLocation: Williamsburg, Virginia\n\nTop speed: 40 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: More than 2,500 feet\n\nRide’s height: 65 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 42 inches with a supervising companion, 48 inches solo\n\nSnoopy’s Racing Railway at Carowinds\n\nCarowinds’ Camp Snoopy is expanding with a new family coaster and new raft ride. On Snoopy’s Racing Railway, Snoopy races to resupply Camp Snoopy’s mess hall, when it runs out of root beer and pizza, according to the park.\n\n“It’s a family launch coaster, which is fun because you don’t get too many launch coasters on family-size rides,” Perry said. The park says the ride will go from 0 to 31 miles per hour within seconds.\n\nOpening: Late spring targeted\n\nLocation: Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nTop speed: 31 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 804 feet\n\nRide’s height: Not listed\n\nMinimum height to ride: Not listed\n\nBeach Rescue Racer at SeaWorld San Antonio\n\nSeaWorld San Antonio is also opening a new family coaster. Beach Rescue Racer will be part of the park’s new kid-centered play area, Rescue Jr.\n\n“They rethemed from Sesame Street to Rescue Jr., so all about conservation and inspiring kids to want to save the environment, save the oceans,” Perry said.\n\nKids will board a beach Jeep to rush to the aid of stranded beach creatures on the ride.\n\nOpening: March 8\n\nLocation: San Antonio, Texas\n\nTop speed: 31 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 1,305 feet\n\nRide’s height: 49 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 36 inches\n\nPalindrome and Circuit Breaker at COTALand\n\nCoaster lovers are also looking forward to the opening of several rides that were supposed to open last year, including Palindrome and Circuit Breaker at the new Circuit of the Americas theme park, COTALand, in Austin, Texas.\n\nLike Siren’s Curse, Circuit Breaker will be a tilt coaster, while Palindrome will shuttle guests forward and backward.\n\nAccording to ACE, Palindrome will feature 1,230 feet of track, a height of 95 feet and top speed of 51 miles per hour. Few details have been released on Circuit Breaker.\n\nThe Flash: Vertical Velocity at Six Flags Great Adventure\n\nThe Flash: Vertical Velocity is also opening later than previously expected. When it debuts, it will be the first super boomerang coaster in North America and only second worldwide, according to Six Flags Great Adventure.\n\nLike a boomerang, it will launch guests both forward and backward for two unique ride experiences.\n\n“Can’t wait to experience the Zero-G roll inversion on this coaster,” Moore said.\n\nOpening: Spring\n\nLocation: Jackson, New Jersey\n\nTop speed: 59 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 1,430 feet\n\nRide’s height: 172 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 48 inches\n\nGeorgia Gold Rusher at Six Flags Over Georgia\n\nGeorgia Gold Rusher was also supposed to open last year as the Georgia Surfer at Six Flags Over Georgia.\n\nA regional spokesperson for Six Flags Entertainment Corporation told USA TODAY they didn’t want to rush construction and pivoted to the new name as part of the company's renewed investment in theming. When Six Flags merged with Cedar Fair last summer, the company said it would focus on investing and innovating in its parks.\n\nThe new coaster features a “first of its kind free-spinning gondola riding experience,\" according to Six Flags Over Georgia’s website.\n\nOpening: 2025\n\nLocation: Austell, Georgia\n\nTop speed: 60 miles per hour\n\nTrack length: 590 feet\n\nRide’s height: 144 feet\n\nMinimum height to ride: 52 inches\n\n(This story has been updated with new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2019/06/27/things-do-iowa-summer-family-fun/1580511001/", "title": "100 things to do in Iowa this summer: 2019 edition", "text": "Heather Torpy\n\nSpecial to the Register\n\nThe Des Moines Register has gathered some of the best 2019 vacation ideas, free activities, things to see and fun things to do in Des Moines and around Iowa this summer.\n\nTake a look:\n\n1.

The wind-down will begin in August, with guests last welcome on Sept. 6 to Hurricane Harbor, although the park will remain open through Fright Fest.\n\nIs Six Flags shutting down completely?\n\nSix Flags Entertainment Corp., now merged with Cedar Fair, isn’t shutting down entirely, but the combined company will permanently close two parks.\n\nCarly Sauvageau contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2021/06/28/fun-things-do-cincinnati-and-southwest-ohio-summer/7692968002/", "title": "Fun things to do in Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio this summer", "text": "Ready to venture beyond your own backyard this summer?\n\nIf the answer is a resounding \"yes,\" then you've come to the right place.

A piece of the ride became dislodged and struck a woman standing in line in the head.\n\nState investigators spent five months looking into the cause of the accident. They found loose bolts, signs of wear, deformation, and impact marks on train cars and sections of track over the spot where a metal plate broke from the ride and fell.\n\nThe piece of metal described as about the size of \"a man's hand\" struck the woman Aug. 15, 2021. The accident left 44-year-old Michigan resident Rachel Hawes in intensive care with a brain injury, the family said in a statement after the accident.\n\nTop Thrill Dragster investigation\n\nThe Ohio Department of Agriculture — charged with the inspection of amusement rides — found in its February report that Cedar Point had no knowledge that the ride was in an unsafe condition the day of the accident.\n\nThe plate that dislodged was attached by bolts and was supposed to hover just over the track and a series of sensors that kept tabs on the coaster as it made its way at breakneck speed up and over a 420-foot-tall hill in 17 seconds.\n\nBefore the mishap, some 18 million guests rode the ride, which sent riders in the air at a speed of 120 miles per hour in just 3.8 seconds.\n\nWhen it opened in 2003, Top Thrill Dragster was the tallest and fastest coaster in the world, but those records were surpassed in 2005 by the Kingda Ka coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey. It also boasted faux Goodyear Tires when it first opened.\n\nPast Top Thrill Dragster incidents\n\nFrom the start, the coaster was plagued by issues that led to its frequent closings as the park grappled with its complicated and temperamental hydraulic system.\n\nRiders were injured in a pair of previous mishaps on the coaster. In July 2004, four passengers were struck by flying debris from a frayed metal cable, and in 2016 two riders were injured when a launch cable detached from the coaster.\n\nThe ride attracted long lines and gawkers since its opening in 2003. It even had a set of bleachers where onlookers could watch it run.\n\nCedar Point's future\n\nIn its announcement on social media Monday morning, Cedar Point said the ride \"as you know it is being retired.\"\n\nThe park said an announcement will be made later of a new and \"reimagined\" ride experience.\n\nWhile the Top Thrill will be gone at the start of the 2023 season and its apparent replacement remains in limbo, there will be a new coaster at the park next summer. And it couldn't be more different size-wise and otherwise.\n\nCedar Point is bringing back a Wild Mouse coaster to its reimagined new Boardwalk area along the eastern beach side of the park.\n\nThe new Wild Mouse roller coaster will reach a height of 52 feet and boast six mouse-themed cars and one that is cheese-themed. The new coaster will feature cars that spin 360 degrees as it navigates 1,312 feet of dipping and twisting orange track.\n\nThe park's old Wild Mouse coaster — the Wildcat — was removed in 2011 to make way for an outdoor stage near the Valravn roller coaster.\n\nCedar Point's summer 2023 plans: New Wild Mouse coaster and lakefront restaurant to be part of revamped Boardwalk area at Cedar Point.\n\nThe park's roster of active roller coasters now stands at just 16 — down from 18 a season ago — as it approaches its popular fall HalloWeekends season.\n\nThe Top Thrill Dragster joins the ranks of the Wicked Twister, Mean Streak, Mantis and Disaster Transport that were either removed or completely reimagined in recent memory.\n\nCedar Point boasts best and biggest coasters, enthusiast says\n\nThe legacy of the Top Thrill Dragster and its place in roller coaster history will never be forgotten, said Elizabeth Ringas, communications director for the American Coaster Enthusiasts club.\n\nSimply put, Ringas said, Cedar Point has a rich history of building the biggest and best roller coasters over the years, earning it the moniker of \"America's Roller Coast.\" The fact that Cedar Point still has 16 roller coasters in its lineup is still impressive, Ringas said, as many so-called major parks boast less than 10.\n\nSome 860 ACE members traveled near and far this summer for a club gathering in Sandusky to take in the park's roller coasters.\n\nRingas, who once lived near Cincinnati but now calls Virginia home, said she will miss the Dragster, having ridden it some 50 times over the years. She remembers waiting three hours and 45 minutes to ride it the first time because it was having some mechanical issues on that particular day.\n\n\"The feeling of the wind catching your cheeks,\" she said. \"There was just nothing like it on Earth.\"\n\nRingas said Cedar Point never does a major ride halfway, so she's pretty confident whatever becomes of the revamped Dragster will be memorable too.\n\n\"I'm on the edge of my seat to see what happens,\" she said. \"I hope this leads to something great.\"\n\nCraig Webb, who once had a rare rollback on the Dragster, can be reached at cwebb@thebeaconjournal.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2025/05/09/2025-delaware-summer-guide-what-to-know-beaches/83498779007/", "title": "Everything you need to know about enjoying your summer in ...", "text": "And just like that, summer is more than half over.\n\nVisit us on Delaware Online for more stories every week about the beaches, as well as fairs and festivals, concerts and family fun, downtowns and museums and so much more.\n\nWe offer all the details you need for active recreation including camping, golfing, surf fishing, cycling, hiking and pickleball, water sports, boat rides and even Skee-ball.\n\nCome back often for photo galleries from the Riverfront to the beaches, and everywhere in between, as well as updates on summer concerts, arts events, family fun and all the things that will make summer in Small Wonder all it can be.\n\nIt's very much summertime at the Delaware beaches, but it feels like fall could begin at any moment.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle?

It's the internet, so reviews can be harsh and five-star ratings are few and far between.https://www.usatodaynetworkservice.com/tangstatic/html/pwil/sf-q1a2z3584c02f3.min.html\n\nWhen we searched the beach towns for restaurants with five-star ratings, there were no big-name eateries on the list. The highest-rated places are nearly all tiny spots just off the main streets - true hidden gems.\n\nThese are the restaurants and eateries with five-star Yelp reviews at the Delaware beaches.\n\nOver the past 65 years, The Starboard has grown from a small, sleepy restaurant into a must-visit party bar in the heart of Dewey Beach, powered by its signature drink: The Orange Crush.\n\nAnd now it's getting some major national attention.\n\nThat's right – on July 30, USA TODAY named the iconic boisterous Sussex County watering hole as one of the 29 USA TODAY Bars of the Year for 2025.How we did it: Best Bars in America: How USA TODAY picked the 2025 finalists\n\n\"It's exciting. I'm a little biased, so I agree with the assessment,\" said Starboard co-owner Steve \"Monty\" Montgomery, reacting to the news. \"The Starboard is many things to many people.

And while that's a nice place for the dogs, she said when they walk their pups they need to be on a leash.\n\nSo having a dog park to be able to go to benefits her furry pets in many ways.\n\n\"The biggest benefit is having them socialize somewhat with other small dogs and then just letting them burn off some energy that they may not be able to do at home on a leash,\" said Fogarty, owner of Sunny Meadows Stables — a horse boarding barn in Townsend.\n\nIf you’re looking for your next adventure to have an equestrian theme, this guide to horseback riding in Delaware has you covered.\n\nWhether you are a seasoned horseback rider or are interested in learning, Delaware has equestrian offerings for all ages and levels of experience.\n\nHere’s where you can find horseback riding lessons for all ages, the best trails Delaware has to offer, and summer camps for future equestrians.\n\nReturn visitors to Rehoboth Beach's iconic mile-long boardwalk expect to see familiar sites: Thrasher's fries, Grotto Pizza, Kohr Bros. ice cream, the carousel at Funland, and the diving dolphins on the roof of the building housing the miniature golf course.\n\nThe dolphin figurines were part of Ryan's Mini Golf at Delaware Avenue on the boardwalk's south end for decades. But when the business (and building) was sold earlier this year to the owners of Zelky's arcades, the dolphins were removed and put in storage.\n\nLooking to get a vineyard experience this summer without traveling cross-country for delicious wine?\n\nThese Delaware (and nearby) wineries offer residents and visitors alike the opportunity to wind down with an adult beverage this summer.\n\nIt seems like everyone wants to move to Delaware these days.\n\nThe days of \"Dela-where?\" have passed, it appears, because people have discovered the First State's low taxes, rural charm and, especially, its gorgeous beaches.\n\nFamilydestinationsguide.com has even named \"9 Charming Beach Towns In Delaware You’ll Wish You Could Call Home.\"\n\n\"Looking for dreamy beach towns in Delaware to call home?

Lewes has both an ocean and a bay beach, but as such a popular tourist destination, we're not counting it as a \"secret.\"\n\nI once had the chance to swim in the Ligurean Sea, in the Cinque Terre off the coast of northern Italy.\n\nOne of the wonders of taking a dip or walking the shoreline of Monterosso del Mare is gathering pieces of old roof tile, worn smooth by the sea. Holding colorful history in the palm of your hand while sunning on a beach blanket is a memorable experience and provided a free souvenir to remember our journey.\n\nDelaware, as it happens, is a wonderful place for those who love to gather treasures along its shorelines, namely brightly colored sea glass.\n\nIn pristine whites, frosty opaques, and varying shades of greens and blues, sea glass can be beautiful and used to fill glass bowls or jars, add interest to flower vases, terrarium or garden, or just to scatter on a windowsill to gather light. And of course, these free treasures also can be made into jewelry or other items.\n\nThe trash-to-treasure beach find has collected quite a following among crafters and beachcombers, and there are entire festivals and shops revolved around local sea glass.\n\nSummer is halfway over, but with warmer air and ocean temperatures extending into the fall, there's still plenty of time to get the most from the best Delaware beaches have to offer.\n\nThis 2025 ranking of the top beaches to spend spring break at in the United States features a familiar local hot spot, but no need to wait until then to enjoy it.

Visit social media sites for updates.\n\nSummer is typically defined by its lack of school, and the beach by its lack of work or general responsibilities. Not to mention the sand, drinks and time in the sun.\n\nBut maybe, during your day trip, vacation or weekend away at the Delaware beaches, you're also looking for some educational escapes.\n\nIt could be exploring your next read at Rehoboth Beach's Browseabout Books, or gaining a better understanding of aerodynamics at Funland amusement park.\n\nIt could see you down in Dewey, learning to operate a personal watercraft, pontoon, stand-up paddleboard or kayak with Dewey Beach Watersports. Rehoboth Bay offers more relaxed water fun, while a surfing scene often can be found ocean-side.\n\nWater parks might be one of the best things about being alive in this day and age. Cooling off with a side of adrenaline? Yes, please.\n\nIf you get spooked by a jellyfish or for some other reason tire of the Delaware beaches, there are several water parks in the area to check out. Make sure to visit your chosen park's website and carefully look over the height restrictions and rules before visiting.\n\nHere's what to know about each of the Delaware beaches' water parks.\n\nYou're working in your garden, pulling weeds and making sure everything looks pretty.\n\nA few hours later, while admiring your garden, you start to feel an itch on your arm and notice some red bumps.

The department implemented it after the pandemic, when people lined up at state parks the night before a limited number of surf-fishing permits were released. Since then, an unlimited number of surf-fishing permits have been available, but with the caveat of having to make reservations on summertime weekends and holidays.\n\nStarting July 12, those reservations will be required at only five of Delaware's drive-on beaches: Gordons Pond, Herring Point, Navy Crossing and Point Crossing in Cape Henlopen State Park and 3R’s in Delaware Seashore State Park.\n\nTake a virtual stroll through Brandywine Creek State Park and plan your next picnic or outdoor ramble with nature with our photo gallery.\n\nThe family that has operated a longtime farm and market in north Wilmington has taken over the former SIW Vegetables produce market near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.\n\nStewart and Carl Ramsey, who run Ramsey’s Farm, reopened the Pennsylvania market at 4336 S.

Kinda.\n\nI was the guest matador for the 28th annual Running of the Bull at The Starboard – a seriously unserious event that draws more than 1,500 people in white shirts and red bandanas for Delaware's lighthearted version of the traditional Pamplona, Spain, bull run.\n\nIn the summertime, local teens gather at the Delaware beaches to meet friends or make new ones, while teens of tourist families often venture out on their own, looking to interact with people their own age.\n\nWhat's not to love about coming of age with sandy feet, the smell of saltwater and the sound of waves crashing?\n\nWell, teens are quickly bored. As any adult likely remembers, the beach can only entertain for so many hours of the day, and then there are the hours after dark to fill, as well.\n\nIn recent years, crowds of teens gathering in public areas at night has become a problem for police.\n\nCheck out these historic photos of miniature golf courses at Rehoboth Beach over the decades, courtesy of the Library of Congress.\n\nWalking off the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk and onto the floor of Funland is like arriving in a place outside of time.\n\nWhat year is it? You may be there with your kids or grandkids, but at the same time, you can see the memories of being there with your parents or grandparents. The nostalgia is undeniable, but visions of future generations on the firetrucks, the Paratrooper and the Haunted Mansion flash through your head, as well.\n\nFunland is downright magical, and that's partially because it's been around since the 1960s. There have been updates made, new rides added, but the atmosphere of innocent joy remains.\n\nThis is the history of \"The Nation's Summer Capital's\" most treasured landmark, with information sourced from both the Funland website and \"Land of Fun,\" a book by Chris Lindsley.\n\nHow often do you think about the water quality of the beaches you visit?\n\nAccording to a new report ranking the cleanest and dirtiest beaches in the United States, Delawareans don’t have to worry about water quality as much as those in other states.\n\nHere’s how some of the First State’s beaches fared.\n\nA beach vacation is often about nostalgia, and few know that better than Matt Weiner.\n\nWhen Weiner's father, Chuck, opened the first of three arcades in Rehoboth Beach 40 years ago, young Matt spent summers in the family-friendly business on the north side of the boardwalk, then known as Dolle's Arcade.\n\nAt age 7, he was wearing a change belt and walking around, handing out quarters to players for the coin-operated games.\n\nVirtual reality and arcades are popular, and there are more than a handful of places in Delaware to enjoy the games.\n\nHere are some places around the state where folks can find VR and arcades this summer.\n\nSummer isn’t just a season. It’s a feeling. A time humming with possibility.\n\nAt Longwood Gardens, we celebrate the summer with our Festival of Fountains season, on view now through Sept. 28.\n\nIt’s an exuberant time in our Gardens, filled with brilliant blooms, soaring fountains, sun-soaked days, and refreshing evenings spent under the stars. There’s something new—and spectacular—to experience every day.\n\nIt may seem like Delaware's strongest marketplace right now comes in sand and surf.\n\nAfter all, millions of tourists visit its beaches every summer.\n\nBut another economic driver might draw you off the coast. Agriculture. And on a smaller scale than poultry or mega-farm operations, the First State is home to many local farms that encourage visitors, handpicking and even petting the animals.\n\nHere are just a few examples to be found in southern Delaware – there are so many more – because maybe it's time one summer outing brought you inland.\n\nDewey Beach will be awash in red, white and orange this weekend as one of Delaware's wackiest traditions returns for its 28th year.\n\nThe Starboard's Running of the Bull, which started as an inside joke at a Dewey Beach house group rental in the mid-'90s, will take over the tiny beach town June 28, officially kicking off at 2 p.m.\n\nGoing to the beach is a summer staple for many people.\n\nIf you’re looking for a new sandy oasis to explore or a lesser-known spot to beat the crowds, a few Delaware beaches were named the best hidden gems across the United States.\n\nFor many, the Orange Crush is synonymous with summer and, more specifically, Dewey Beach.\n\nCementing its legend, the drink was named the official state cocktail by then-Gov. John Carney just last year.\n\nWhile Delaware claims the Orange Crush as our own, it's actually an export from our neighbors to the south: Maryland. It was actually first served at Harborside Bar & Grill in Ocean City 30 years ago this year.\n\nWhen the sun goes down and the temperatures rise, Delaware’s nightlife heats up. Whether you’re looking for a packed out house, an electrifying performance or a curated list of your favorite music, the First State has something for every partygoer. From legendary coastal venues to grand city music halls, these spots are where summer memories are made.\n\nReady to hit the dance floor? Here’s your guide to some of the biggest party destinations in Delaware this summer.\n\nFor many Delawareans, there’s no better way to beat the summer heat than taking a nice, relaxing dip in the pool.\n\nWhether you’re taking some long-overdue me-time lounging about on a floatie or playing a game of Marco Polo with your friends, the pool has a little bit of something for everyone.\n\nNow, with the weather warming up, many of us across the state are itching to kick off – or rather, dive into – the summer season with a classic day at the pool.\n\nHere’s where you can go – and what you can do – to have the perfect pool day in Delaware this season.\n\nCheck out the bar, pub and restaurant scene in Wilmington this summer.\n\nWhat makes a Delaware beach vacation a Delaware beach vacation?\n\nIt's not just the sand and surf. There are the boardwalks, the amusement parks, the state parks. The restaurants, the bars. There are places you have to go, things you have to see, to really make it a Delaware beach vacation.

While Fleetwood Mac's days performing together are likely over following fellow member Christine McVie's death in 2022, you can still see Nicks live, including at this Amalie Arena show.\n\nCynthia Erivo\n\nSept. 3; Ruth Eckerd Hall\n\nCynthia Erivo is having a busy 2025, between earning an Oscar nomination for her role in the film adaptation of \"Wicked\" and starring in this year's upcoming sequel \"Wicked: For Good,\" hosting the Tony Awards, and releasing the album \"I Forgive You.\" She's also been performing with orchestras, with this Ruth Eckerd Hall show featuring the Florida Orchestra rescheduled from an earlier date in May.\n\nThomas Rhett\n\nSept. 5; MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nIn a solo career that's lasted just over a decade, Thomas Rhett has scored 20 No. 1 country airplay hits and two albums (2017's \"Life Changes\" and 2019's \"Center Point Road\") that not only topped Billboard's country albums chart but also the overall Billboard 200. He'll perform with rising country star Tucker Wetmore, who landed at No. 4 on Billboard's country albums chart and No. 15 on the Billboard 200 for his debut full-length \"What Not To\" released earlier this year.\n\nCoheed and Cambria/Taking Back Sunday\n\nSept. 6; MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nEven if you can't make Vans Warped Tour — which this year has only Florida date, Nov. 15-16 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando — you can still catch this show featuring two of the festival's former top acts: prog rockers Coheed and Cambria and pop-punkers Taking Back Sunday, both from New York. Show up early to see St. Louis indie group Foxing.\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nSept. 10; Amalie Arena\n\nInducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, Nine Inch Nails made their debut with 1989's \"Pretty Hate Machine,\" then reached rock stardom with 1994's quadruple-platinum \"The Downward Spiral.\" Frontman Trent Reznor and collaborator Atticus Ross have focused on film scores in recent years — winning two Oscars for \"The Social Network\" and \"Soul\" — but Nine Inch Nails proper will contribute new music to Disney's upcoming \"Tron: Ares.\"\n\nJessie Murph\n\nSept. 10; Yuengling Center, Tampa; yuenglingcenter.com\n\nThe 20-year-old singer-songwriter whose sound blends country, rap and pop tours in support of her upcoming sophomore studio album \"Sex Hysteria,\" with its single \"Blue Strips\" landing at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. This year also saw Jessie Murph land an Academy of Country Music Awards nomination for New Female Artist of the Year.\n\nIce Cube\n\nSept. 11; Amalie Arena\n\nFrom being a member of the pioneering and perpetually controversial '80s rap group N.W.A, to striking out on his own in the '90s as a solo musician and star of movies such as \"Boyz n the Hood\" and \"Friday,\" to even branching out into family-friendly fare with the \"Barbershop\" films and \"Are We There Yet?\" in the 2000s, Ice Cube has lived many lives artistically. That longevity should be reflected on this tour touting \"Four Decades of Attitude.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance\n\nSept. 13; Raymond James Stadium\n\nOne of the biggest bands of the 2000s emo/alt-rock era before breaking up in 2013, My Chemical Romance has since reunited and is going on tour to celebrate their 2006 album \"The Black Parade,\" which turns 20 next year. They'll be joined in Tampa by one of their past contemporaries: Evanescence, whose 2003 hit \"Bring Me to Life\" played a prominent part in the recent second season of the HBO show \"The Rehearsal.\"\n\nBenson Boone\n\nSep. 13; Amalie Arena\n\nSinger Benson Boone is currently best known for two things: his No. 2 hit \"Beautiful Things,\" and doing backflips. Like, a lot, for some reason. However, those two things have been enough to earn him a Best New Artist Grammy nomination, a musical guest spot on \"Saturday Night Live,\" a Coachella set where he was joined by Queen guitarist Brian May, and now an arena tour in support of his latest album, this year's \"American Heart.\"\n\nCage the Elephant\n\nSept. 17; The BayCare Sound\n\nTampa Bay alternative rock radio station 97X presents the band known for songs such as \"Cigarette Daydreams\" and \"Ain't No Rest for the Wicked\" in this \"97X Next Big Thing Legends\" concert, named after the annual music festival that Cage the Elephant has played multiple times. Dexter and the Moonrocks and Girl Tones will also perform.\n\nTom Segura\n\nSept. 20; Ruth Eckerd Hall\n\nThe former Vero Beach resident is known for his stand-up specials (his most recent being 2023's \"Sledgehammer\") and hosting the podcasts \"Your Mom's House\" with his wife/fellow comedian Christina Pazsitzky and \"Two Bears One Cave\" with fellow former Floridian Bert Kreischer. Segura also recently starred in his own Netflix series \"Bad Thoughts.\"\n\nThree 6 Mafia/Bone Thugs-n-Harmony\n\nSept. 20; MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nOscar-winning \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp\" Southern rappers Three 6 Mafia and \"Tha Crossroads\" hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony team up for The Thuggish-Ruggish-Mafia Tour, which will also feature rappers Tech N9ne and DJ Quik.\n\nAnuel AA\n\nSept. 21; Amalie Arena\n\nThe Puerto Rican rapper tours in support of his upcoming album \"Real Hasta la Muerte 2,\" the sequel to his 2018 debut studio album. Anuel AA has also appeared on songs by other artists such as Shakira and Bad Bunny, and more recently on remixes of songs by Jennifer Lopez and Ice Spice.\n\nA Day to Remember/Yellowcard\n\nSept. 27; MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nHere's another concert for Warped Tour fans who won't be able to make it to Orlando, headlined by two bands from Florida themselves: Ocala metalcore group A Day to Remember, and Jacksonville pop-punkers Yellowcard. Two newer groups from the same respective genres, Boundaries and State Champs, will also perform.\n\nEmail entertainment reporter Jimmy Geurts at jimmy.geurts@heraldtribune.com.

You may want to vet the venue first.\n\nWith hefty competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, movie theaters have really had to step up their game in recent years. From recliners to movie club passes to full bars, it takes a lot to yank people from the comfort of their own home and plop them in front of the silver screen.\n\nBut nothing beats seeing a summer blockbuster or diving into the latest indie flick in a theater. You just have to find the spot that suits your needs.\n\nWell, you're welcome.\n\nWe compiled a list of all the cinemas in the Louisville area and ranked them from best to worst plus provided some pro tips on how to have the best experience.\n\nMake your plans: 8 things to do in and around Louisville this Memorial Day weekend\n\nBest theater for a date? Cheapest prices? Most comfy seats? We've got you covered.\n\nBusinesses were graded on several criteria including seats, sound, prices, accessibility, visuals, overall atmosphere and, of course, the bathrooms. We even sampled the popcorn (didn't have to twist our arms there).\n\nEach spot had a chance to earn up to 40 total points. And we were pretty critical.\n\nHere are all the theaters in the area ranked:\n\n1. Cinemark Mall St. Matthews: Best overall score\n\n5000 Shelbyville Road, Louisville; 502-259-9649; score: 28 points\n\nLouisville's newest major theater is fully loaded, with almost everything you'd expect from a modern movie house.\n\nThe screens are huge and high quality, and we didn't even shell out for the XD experience. The seats recline and you sink right into them, we almost took a nap. You can also choose what particular seat you want, which is nice if you're going with a big group or want to reserve a seat right at the front.\n\nThe snack stand has everything you'd want, including a full bar if you're thirsty. One drawback is the number of individual theaters — this Cinemark doesn't have quite as many movies showing at one time as other spots around town, although it should have most of the biggest movies in the country playing.\n\nPro tip: This theater is in Mall St. Matthews, which should appeal to shoppers who don't blow their whole budget on popcorn.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $10 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.50 Tuesday; about $12-$13.75 Friday-Sunday\n\n2. Baxter Avenue Theaters: Best experience\n\n1250 Bardstown Road, Louisville; 502-459-2288; score: 27 points\n\nYou won't find any thrills or grandeur at this quaint location tucked behind Mid-City Mall in the Highlands. And that's just fine. This stylish theater has charm.\n\nWith a prime spot by Bardstown Road, there are plenty of locally owned and diverse things to do both before and after the feature. Prices here are great — albeit not as cheap as its sister spot Village 8 — and you can even catch screenings of lesser known indie films here not screened anywhere else in the city. Add to that, Apex Theatres has often brought back classics like \"Halloween\" or \"Cruel Intentions\" during special events.\n\nDid we mention the reclining seats?\n\nPro tip: Buy your tickets far in advanced. They sell out quick here.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $9.25 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.75 Tuesday; about $10 Friday-Sunday\n\n3. Xscape Theatres: Best place to spend a summer afternoon\n\n12450 Sycamore Station Place, Louisville; 502-709-6000; score: 27 points\n\nIt's pretty far out there in the East End, but the Xscape Theatres complex has everything you're looking for if you're in the area. Xscape has a good number of theaters, including a massive \"Xtreme Xscape\" screen, if you can handle a little sensory overload. (Go big or go home, right?)\n\nThe seats recline and are a great place to spend a few hours. The snack stand isn't huge but it has all the snack foods you'd expect, with beer and wine offerings. The building is tidy and bathrooms have been clean on our visits. It's a cool place.\n\nPro tip: Xscape is conveniently located across the street from the Main Event, a huge entertainment center with bowling, billiards, rock climbing and a bunch of other games and activities. It's a cool place to bring a group before catching a flick if you want to spend an afternoon hanging out ahead of the movie.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $14.50 Monday, Wednesday-Sunday; $9 Tuesday\n\nYou may like: Everything you need to know about the Abbey Road on the River festival\n\n4. Louisville Palace: Best movie theater for date night\n\n625 S. 4th St. Louisville; 502-583-4555; score: 26 points\n\nIf you're looking to impress your date with a memorable movie night, the Louisville Palace is the place to go. From its stunning architecture to its captivating history, the atmosphere here is sure to spark romance.\n\nThe Palace doesn't show movies often and when it does, it tends to feature old Hitchcock flicks like \"Vertigo\" to classic Warner Bros. films like \"Casablanca.\" So if old fashioned isn't your cup of tea, maybe skip this specific outing.\n\nThe movies here are pretty cheap — usually $5 a flick — so you won't go broke, but you may have to pay for downtown parking as it's located in the middle of downtown. One other drawback? The seats don't recline.\n\nPro tip: Dress to the nines (if you're feeling it) and come early to fully take in your surroundings.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $5-8 per showing\n\n5. Cinemark Tinseltown: Best seats\n\n4400 Towne Center Drive, Louisville; 502-326-9272; score: 26 points\n\nWe'll get right to the point here — Tinseltown's seats, which are a key part of any movie experience, are the best you'll find in the Louisville area. Plush, modern recliners are in all theaters, with trays — trays! — for your food. No more resting your popcorn on the side of your seat, or saying a quick prayer that no one kicks it over if you rest it on the ground. You reserve your own seat here as well, which is clutch for a group experience.\n\nThe rest of Tinseltown is about what you'd expect from the East End landmark. The food menu has what you're looking for but isn't over the top, the prices are reasonable by movie theater standards (we spent $10 on a Monday night ticket) and there are plenty of showings of all the biggest movies. Nothing over the top, but Tinseltown gets the job done.\n\nPro tip: Tinseltown traditionally brings out a younger crowd, or at least it did during this reporter's teenage years. Plan accordingly.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $10 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.50 Tuesday; about $12-13.75 Friday-Sunday\n\n6. Cinemark Preston Crossing 16: Dine in at this spot\n\n9700 Preston Crossing Blvd., Louisville; 502-961-9700; score: 26 points\n\nNot much differs at this Okolona Cinemark from the Tinseltown location — comfortable seats, food trays, and decent enough prices. You can watch a movie in standard, XD or 3D and the interior is spacious and inviting — what you'd expect from a quality theater.\n\nWhat's notable here is that there is a restaurant located right inside the theater. That's right, this is a one-stop dinner-and-a-movie spot. Plus there's a cute little gift area with plushies, T-shirts and movie collectibles. So bring the kids, unless you don't want to spend more money than you planned.\n\nPro tip: There's a little button on the seats that warms them up. That's right, heated seats!\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $9.50 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.50 Tuesday; about $12-13.75 Friday-Sunday\n\n7. Village 8: Best value, ticket prices\n\n4014 Dutchmans Lane, Louisville; 502-897-1870; score: 25 points\n\nWhen it comes to an affordable night out, Village 8 is your best bet in the Louisville area. You can catch a flick and a bag of popcorn for well under $10 any night of the week — they even have $2 Tuesdays. And this theater often shows movies you can't catch at another spot in the city.\n\nThe catch? The movies shown at Village 8 have been out for a minute, so if you want to see that new Marvel blockbuster, you'll have to wait a while. Also, the seats aren't very comfortable and the atmosphere is a bit dingy. But if you don't mind a no-frills flick outing, this place is a great choice. Of note, there are no recliners here.\n\nPro tip: Maybe don't see that summer blockbuster here, but keep it in mind for a casual outing.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $4 Monday, Wednesday, Friday-Sunday; $3 Thursday; $2 Tuesday\n\n8. AMC Stonybrook: Best theater for a large group\n\n2745 S Hurstbourne Parkway, Louisville; 502-272-4471; score: 24 points\n\nAMC Stonybrook has a big, comfy lobby with plenty of options for food and drinks as the concession area is large and there's a separate spot for the bar. The screens are good and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. Bringing a large group of family or friends? It's definitely easy at this theater.\n\nAs long as you have a lot of cash. This place isn't exactly affordable. It does have discount nights but you have to pay for an AMC Stubs membership, so unless you are an avid movie-goer, you may want to steer clear. Also, the seats aren't very comfortable, especially now that this generation is spoiled with cozy reclining seats.\n\nPro tip: Bring a large group here but be on the lookout for coupons.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): Around $11 Monday-Thursday; about $12 Friday-Sunday\n\n9. Speed Art Cinema: Most immersive experience\n\n2035 S 3rd St., Louisville; 502-634-2700; score: 24 points\n\nIn case its name didn't spell it out for you, the Speed Art Museum's quaint but colorful theater is for the artsy folks. You're mostly going to find documentaries, biopics and obscure indie movies screened here, but that's why you go. Pair that with the fact that it's in an art museum and this place will have you immersed in culture.\n\nPrices are pretty low too, coming in anywhere from $9 to free on some Sundays, but you will have to pay for parking if you don't live on the University of Louisville campus where it's located. But one perk, if you like a theater-side cocktail, is that you don't have to pay for those overpriced theater drinks or snacks. Of note, no recliners.\n\nPro tip: Invite several people to car pool or split an Uber and avoid parking fees.\n\nYou may like: New Louisville music venue announces its first lineup, led by acts Lucero and Interpol\n\nTicket prices (may vary): Most showings cost around $9; sometimes free on Sunday\n\nSouthern Indiana theaters\n\n10. Regal Cinemas River Falls\n\n951 E Lewis and Clark Parkway, Clarksville, Indiana; 844-462-7342; score: 23 points\n\nThe prices here are a little high, with a Monday night ticket costing about $13, and the old-school seats that don't recline, but if you're in Clarksville with time to kill, River Falls gets the job done. Parking is easy and crowds aren't bad — you shouldn't have to worry about a line for your snacks ahead of the show.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $13 every day\n\n11. Regal Cinemas New Albany\n\n300 Professional Court, New Albany, Indiana; 844-462-7342; score: 22 points\n\nLike its Regal Cinemas sister in Clarksville, the New Albany theater also has relatively high ticket prices and older seats that could use a renovation. The rest of the theater is about what you'd expect — it's not a world-class facility, but it'll do if you're not looking to cross the river. The popcorn, oddly enough, was among the best we ate at any of the regional theaters.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $13 every day", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2019/07/19/6-places-hide-heat-wave-south-jersey/1770368001/", "title": "6 places to hide from the heat wave in South Jersey", "text": "You don't need a weather app to know it's screaming hot outside. New Jersey is under an excessive heat warning, and temps this weekend may hit 100 degrees, with heat indexes much higher than that.\n\nYour first priority is to make sure you and those around you (including animals) are safe.\n\nAfter that, your goal is to seek cool and stay cool til the mercury sinks and we can all go back to arguing about whether \"Stranger Things 3'' has jumped the shark.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for escaping the heatwave and chilling out this weekend:\n\n1. We All Scream-a: Our favorite movie ice cream reference is the scene in Jim Jarmusch's \"Down by Law'' when Roberto Benigni and John Lurie circle their prison cell chanting, \"I sceam-a, you scream-a, we all scream-a for ice cream-a!''\n\nIn scorching weather, it's more than permissible to eat ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And if you need any more incentive, consider that Sunday is National Ice Cream Day!\n\nWhen it comes to ice cream you have plenty of choices from the Evergreen Dairy Bar in Medford, which is celebrating it's 70th birthday, to the nearest thai-rolled ice cream shop or a downtown gelateria. But if you want something truly special, consider chilling out at Park Place Cafe in Merchantville, where Chef/owner Phil Manganaro has churned out New Jersey Woodland Blueberry Ice Cream, using handpicked Jersey jewels. Get it while it lasts for $8 at the restaurant, which is a great place to enjoy a relaxing summer meal. Reservations recommended.\n\nThen go home and watch \"Down by Law.''\n\nGo: Park Place Cafe and Restaurant, 7 E. Park Ave, Merchantville. (856) 662-2200 or https://www.parkplacecafeandrestaurant.com/\n\n2. Ticket to Hide: What better place to escape a scorcher than to settle into an air conditioned theater for a musical or play? It's relaxing, fun and never gets old, even if it means taking a break from streaming six (or was it seven?) Netflix series. This weekend you can choose from \"The Music Man'' at Ritz Theatre Company in Haddon Township, \"Cinderella'' and \"The Drowsy Chaperone'' at the Dennis Flyer Theatre in Blackwood or \"All Shook Up'' at Haddonfield Plays & Players.\n\nGo: Ritz Theatre Company, 915 White Horse Pike, Haddon Township. ritztheatreco.org; Mainstage Center for the Arts, Dennis Flyer Theatre, Camden County College, 200 College Drive, Blackwood. mainstage.org; Haddonfield Plays & Players, 957 E. Atlantic Ave., Haddonfield. haddonfieldplayers.com/events/2019/7/11/all-shook-up\n\n3. Like a Hurricane: Calypso Springs, the largest new attraction at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor since the water park opened in 2000, is ready to help you chill.\n\nGlide right into the beach entry-style pool. The erupting fountain, shaped like an obelisk, will cool you off. Calypso Springs also features a lounge deck with oversized umbrellas and hundreds of chairs. You can also rent Bimini shade covers. A new dining location ensures you don't have to go far for lunch.\n\nHurricane Harbor's 45 acres also include a wave pool, a half-mile lazy river, more than 25 high-speed thrill slides and two interactive children’s water playgrounds. All attractions are included with Hurricane Harbor park admission.\n\nGo: Six Flags Great Adventure: 1 Six Flags Blvd., Jackson Township. sixflags.com/greatadventure\n\n4. Splish splash: The only place you want to be outdoors this weekend is submerged in water, or at least getting doused with it. Plan a morning visit to the Camden Children's Garden to commune with the butterflies, ride the train or \"chat'' with Walt Whitman, then beat the heat on the Splash Pad! Park hours are 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nGo: Camden Children's Garden, 3 Riverside Drive, Camden. camdenchildrensgarden.squarespace.com\n\n5. Hoist a Pint: Some things are no brainers when it comes to beating the heat. Watermelon, for instance. Iced tea, or, as we may have mentioned, ice cream. But what would a heat wave be without some cold beer?\n\nSouth Jersey has more breweries than weeks in the year, and a sweltering weekend is a good time to visit a new one, try something new and relax out of the sun.\n\nSome of the area's newest breweries include Bonesaw, Neck of the Woods, Axe & Arrow and Westville, to name just a few.\n\nGo: Bonesaw Brewing Company, 570 Mullica Hill Road, Glassboro. bonesawbrewing.com/index.html; Neck of the Woods Brewing Company, 614 Lambs Road Suite 7, Pitman. neckofthewoodsbrewing.com/index.html; Axe & Arrow Brewing Company, 105 W. High Street, Glassboro. axeandarrowbrewing.com; Westville Brewing Company, 201 Broadway Suite B, Westville. westvillebrewery.com\n\n6. Maximize Imax: Heading to a darkened movie theater may be a no-brainer, but take things up a notch by taking in an Imax film. AMC Cherry Hill's Imax Theatre has \"Lion King'' and \"Spider Man'' screening this weekend.\n\nIf you're planning to head to Philly, you can lose yourself in the Franklin Institute, which is always chilly, for several hours and add to the fun with an Imax film. On view throughout the month at various dates and times is \"Apollo 11 First Steps,'' \"Big Dream: Engineering Our World'' and several other offerings. Check website or call the Franklin for exact times.\n\nWhile you're there, you can also spend some time exercising your brain in the Franklin Escape Rooms. \"Island Escape'' sounds particularly appealing right about now.\n\nGo: AMC Cherry Hill, Route 38, Cherry Hill. imax.com/theatres/amc-cherry-hill-24-imax; The Franklin Institute, 222 N. 20th St., Philadelphia. fi.edu/theaters/imax-theater\n\nKelly-Jane Cotter, Asbury Park Press, contributed to this report.\n\nTammy Paolino covers restaurants, breweries, food trucks and arts events for the USA TODAY New Jersey Network.

I'm Dana Taylor. Today is Sunday, June 9th, 2024. Summer movies can be an exhilarating escape whether you go for action, adventure, captivating thrillers, or the return of a few favorites in the world of animation, the summer of 2024 promises not to disappoint. And as a bonus, catching a movie in theaters is a surefire way to beat the heat in what's expected to be a long, hot summer. Who are the biggest stars? Headed back to the big screen here to give us the scoop on this summer's movie lineup. We're joined by USA TODAY entertainment reporter Ralphie Aversa. Thanks for joining us, Ralphie.\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nDana, always a pleasure.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nLet's start with what could end up being the summer's biggest movie, Deadpool and Wolverine, other than the release date July 26th and that it has two huge stars, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. Has anything been leaked about this one?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nWe know a little bit about the plot. We know that Deadpool and Wolverine, they team up reluctantly to join forces and battle a common enemy. That's pretty much all we know that enemy is threatening their world, so that's all we know as far as that. I'll give you a little bit of inside baseball here too. The other thing that we know about this movie is that it's going to have an unconventional press junket. What do I mean by that? So typically with a movie junket, you'll have the stars of the movie and they'll do interviews mostly either in New York and/or Los Angeles.\n\nOf course now in this day and age, they'll do some virtually as well. There'll be some type of red carpet premiere, maybe premieres plural, depending on how big the movie is. Then they'll do a one-off, like big feature, like a cover story or something like that. And that's it. I can tell you, and we don't have things confirmed yet. Even if we did, I wouldn't be able to spill the beans quite yet, but we're working right now with the movie PR to do something pretty cool for USA Today with both, one Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. So stay tuned for that. But again, I think everything you're going to see that they do for this film, it's not going to be your typical reporter sitting down with Star A and Star B. It's going to be a little different.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnother big popcorn movie coming out. This one produced by Steven Spielberg is a long awaited sequel to the 1996 blockbuster movie Twister called Twisters. It stars Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, and Anthony Ramos. Are we going to see any of the original cast, maybe the return of the flying cow?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nI hope the cow got recasting. I really do. For the cow's sake, I'm sure it was a tough time last year for the cow during the SAG strike. I really want to see that cow back. I'm not sure about the cow. And to seriously answer your question, there's been a lot of conversation around Helen Hunt the star from Twister. Apparently she wanted to make this sequel a while ago. She was shot down by the studio. Now, of course, it's since been greenlit. Will she be involved? At the moment, we haven't heard a thing about her even making a small cameo.\n\nSo I mean, if she did, they have at least thus far kept it under wraps and have done a good job of doing so. But otherwise, it's a whole new cast and a whole new soundtrack as well. I was a big fan of the original Twister soundtrack, in part because I'm originally from the Buffalo New York area and the Goo Goo Dolls contributed it to it. We've already heard one song from that soundtrack, an awesome track from Luke Holmes. So we have that to look forward to also, in addition to the movie out this summer.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThen in August, Cate Blanchett Stars in an action adventure movie alongside Kevin Hart and Ariana Greenblatt. It's called Borderlands. It's based off of a video game of the same name. For those of us who haven't played the game, Ralphie, what's this one about?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nOkay, so it's like a first person multiplayer shooter game. They're called loot games where you pick up different powers and things of that nature, maybe a steal and maybe you pick them up. So the case, and so obviously as you mentioned, a number of big stars involved in this. Look, Hollywood is a very copycat business. A lot of businesses are that way. Certainly in Hollywood, we saw success with HBO, and they did that adaptation of the Last Of Us, which was a PlayStation game, Pedro Pascal. And that performed very, very well for them. And so no surprise that we're seeing this IP reimagined for the silver screen.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThere are two highly anticipated sequels on the way for kids. Let's start with Inside Out 2, the original movie featured characters personifying joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger. What new emotions are being thrown into the mix?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nWell, now that we're getting into our teenage years, Dana, we're going to have those and anxiety. So it'll be interesting to see how they tackle that emotion and adapt it and explain it to a younger audience. But a lot of the emotions you already mentioned will also be featured in the new film.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnd then just in time for the 4th of July holiday, the Minions return in Despicable Me 4. Is the fourth installment of this franchise expected to be a hit with families?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nOh, I think so. Just looking at the trailer, it's so funny. I mean, I have a son who's about to turn one, and I can't wait when he gets old enough where we could A, give him a little more screen time and then B, he can get into these types of films. The trailer looks absolutely fantastic. Of course, we see the introduction of the Mega Minions, not to be confused with something you and I would like to win, the Mega Millions. But yeah, it looks really, really good. I think it'll do well in theaters.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nSo coming out in early July, we have another big movie release, this one coming to Netflix, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. What can we expect there? And do you think that the massive success that we saw with Top Gun: Maverick is going to usher in an era of 1980s nostalgia movies?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\n... Part of that question first, as I mentioned Hollywood, definitely a copycat business. The success of Top Gun: Maverick, has that led to other sequels that maybe wouldn't have been greenlit as quickly or greenlit period? Of course, I think so. That's definitely the case. And when you talk about 80s pop culture, the 80s of course were a very interesting time in the country, but you think about hip-hop and then hip-hop becoming mainstream. You think about rock, you think about hair bands, you think about Chucks, you think about some of these movies as well, whether it's Top Gun or Footloose, which is celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n\nSo Beverly Hills Cop, that's gone into a couple decades because I believe the second one came out in... Or the third one I believe came out in the 90s. And so now we have this fourth one that I am so thrilled about. I loved those movies growing up, and I'm very, very excited about this. I want to believe in my heart of Hearts, Dana, that Eddie Murphy would not have signed on to do this just for a paycheck. I want to believe that he really thinks this will be just as good as its predecessors. We see a number of familiar faces in this, including Eddie. We see some new faces too, including Kevin Bacon. He's got a new role in this also. So I know I'm very much looking forward to Beverly Hills Cop 4, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nKevin Costner's two-part Western, Horizon: An American Saga chapters one and two. We'll bookend this summer. We'll have to wait until the end of June to see the first chapter and then August for chapter two, the early reviews have been lukewarm. What are you hearing there?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nYeah, see, here's the thing, because you start talking about Rotten Tomatoes scores, and it's tough when there's only... Let's just say less than 10 reviews right now. I don't know what the exact number is at the moment, but the early reports, there was I think six or seven reviews, and the reviews weren't favorable. And so then obviously you're not going to have a great score. So I want to give Kevin the benefit of the doubt here. Let's see what happens once more reviews come in. But yes, the early ones aren't great. I will say the other thing I don't think works well in Kevin's favor here is the fact that the movie is so long, this first part.\n\nIt's over three hours. It's tough, especially in this day and age. I know we do see some movies including Oscar nominated movies getting longer and longer, but that doesn't always necessarily mean they are better. So we'll have to wait and see. As for Mr. Costner though, this is another interesting trend. He self-funded this film. There's going to be four parts, and he's sunk in, all in about $100 million of his own money, including mortgaging a ranch where I believe this was filmed. So a lot on the line for Kevin, he's all in, he clearly believes in this project. We'll see if it resonates with an audience.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnd then if spine-tingling tales are your thing, there's a prequel to A Quiet Place on the way. It's called A Quiet Place: Day one. John Krasinski directed the first two films in the franchise, but he handed over the reins for this one. What else can you share with us about the new A Quiet Place?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nThis one not written by John, as you said, it was written by Michael Sarnoski. Michael though did develop the story with John, so he's connected to it still. He didn't just say like, \"I'm done with this, whatever.\" He did work with Michael on the story, and then Michael obviously wrote it and directed. Also stars Lupita Nyong'o. I'm not a big horror movie guy. I'm not a big scary movie guy. I'm going to be... Spooky season isn't my season. But I do think that there are a lot of people looking forward to this prequel.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nM. Night Shyamalan has a thriller called Trap with Josh Hartnett on the way. Is this going to make people not want to go to concerts?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nLook, if you can stomach M. Night's movies, I think you're able to live your life the way... If you're constantly watching his movies, you clearly have a tolerance for things that are churning and things that would make you hesitant to live your everyday life otherwise. So to answer your question, no, I don't think that's going to be the case. But yeah, another one that is highly anticipated for a number of reasons.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAnd then finally, Ralphie, summer typically gives Way to the run-up to the awards season. What big names, big titles should we be watching out for this fall?\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nAll right, we'll give you two. Joker: Folie a Deux, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. Lot of conversation about this. I believe we saw our first trailer at CinemaCon earlier this year. So that one, of course, we'll get some consideration. And then of course, Wicked with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. There has been so much conversation around this film. Of course, some of it has to do with what happened offset while they were filming in Ariana Grande's personal life. But all of that aside, a lot of people looking forward to this. It's going to be a two-parter. We're getting the first part in November. And I would say with both of those, we will see if any of those stars or anybody else involved in those two films are walking the red carpet in Hollywood come March for the Oscars in 2025.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nAll right. Thanks for being on The Excerpt, Ralphie.\n\nRalphie Aversa:\n\nThanks so much, Dana.\n\nDana Taylor:\n\nThanks to our senior producer Shannon Rae Green for production assistance. Our executive producer is Laura Beatty. Let us know what you think of this episode by sending a note to podcasts@usatoday.com. Thanks for listening. I'm Dana Taylor.

She was such a good sport when I started making stuff up about her. (Yes, it's true: When I said she flew her own twin-engine plane to Atlanta for the conference, I was fibbing. Fiction writer!) Today, Jennifer visits to discuss her love of writing action scenes, which has come in handy for this week's new Kiss of Venom digital novella and the upcoming Midnight Frost (July 30) and Heart of Venom (Aug. 27).\n\nJennifer: Greetings! First of all, I want to say thanks to Joyce and the rest of the folks at Happy Ever After for hosting me on the blog today. Thanks so much, guys!\n\nWhether I'm working on a book in my Elemental Assassin urban fantasy series or one in my Mythos Academy young adult urban fantasy series, one of my favorite things to write is action scenes. I just love putting my heroines in danger and then forcing them to use their wits, magic, and whatever other weapons or tricks they might have up their sleeves to defeat the bad guys.\n\nFight scenes, chase scenes, sneaking-up-on-the-bad-guy scenes. I love writing anything that involves some sort of action, whether my heroine is running toward or away from the danger. And if there are magic and explosions involved, then all the better.\n\nSo where does my love of action come from? I would say partly from the movies. There's nothing that I love better than a good action movie, and summer is one of my favorite times to go to the theater to check out the latest action blockbuster, from spy thrillers to heist capers and every kind of action movie in between. So today, I thought that I would share some of my favorite action movies and franchises:\n\nThe James Bond series. No movie franchise and no character does action better than Bond does. Gun battles, explosions, hand-to-hand combat on trains, planes, boats, and just about every other mode of transportation that you can think of with just about every kind of weapon (real and improvised) known to a certain suave secret agent. Bond has done all that and more in practically every part of the world, including underwater and even in space. You can't beat that — or Bond.\n\nThe Jason Bourne series. From the first movie, The Bourne Identity, to the most recent one, The Bourne Legacy, this franchise also features great, globe-trotting action, elaborate chases and gritty fights.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. This one has it all. Sword fights, ships, daring escapes, dramatic rescues, bad guys who can't be killed (at least for part of the movie), and Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, the coolest, craftiest pirate of them all. Half of the fun is watching Captain Jack get into the trouble, and the other half is seeing how he gets out of it again.\n\nThe Princess Bride. Another movie that has it all, including quirky, lovable characters, so many quotable lines (inconceivable!), and a couple of great sword fights. A perfect blend of action, romance and humor.\n\nThe Italian Job. Mark Wahlberg and the rest of his band of cool thieves target the guy who betrayed them in this caper movie. Watching the thieves figure out how to outsmart their enemy is breezy fun, and it all ends with a great car, motorcycle and helicopter chase through Los Angeles.\n\nSo there you have it. Some of my favorite action movies. What about you guys? What are some of your favorite action or summer movies?\n\nHere's the blurb for Heart of Venom (Elemental Assassin #9), coming Aug. 27:\n\nWhen I say you're a dead man, take that literally.\n\nTo me, killing people is like a day at the salon: cut and dry. Well, more like rinse and repeat when you moonlight as the assassin the Spider. But my last spa day ended redder than my freshly painted nails after a twisted Fire elemental and his goons kidnapped my close friend Sophia Deveraux and nearly killed her sister Jo-Jo in the process.\n\nUp Ashland's most dangerous mountains, and deep into the heart of its blackest woods — I'll track these thugs no matter where they take Sophia. It doesn't matter what kind of elemental magic they try to throw at me, my Ice and Stone powers can take the heat and then some. I will get Sophia back, over their dead bodies.\n\nBecause anybody that hurts Gin Blanco's family becomes a body.\n\nAnd the blurb for Midnight Frost (Mythos Academy #5), coming July 30:\n\nHere we go again …\n\nJust when it seems life at Mythos Academy can't get any more dangerous, the Reapers of Chaos manage to prove me wrong. It was just a typical night at the Library of Antiquities — until a Reaper tried to poison me. The good news is I'm still alive and kicking. The bad news is the Reaper poisoned someone else instead.\n\nAs Nike's Champion, everyone expects me to lead the charge against the Reapers, even though I'm still hurting over what happened with Spartan warrior Logan Quinn. I've got to get my hands on the antidote fast — otherwise, an innocent person will die. But the only known cure is hidden in some creepy ruins — and the Reapers are sure to be waiting for me there …\n\nTo find out more about Jennifer and her books, visit www.jenniferestep.com.

(Mondo is an Italian term for the strange or off-beat; that is to say, cult films.) The movies are shown — on a one-time-only basis — at 10 p.m. on select Fridays. Five bucks gets you in.\n\nAnd though the films are readily available for home viewing, they're the kind of movies that are greatly enhanced by a big screen and a simpatico big audience.\n\nUpcoming films for this series follow. (I've added brief notations on a few special favorites.):\n\nRock 'n' Roll High School — May 29.\n\nJaws (1975) — June 5. This is the definitive summer classic, and the film that established the blockbuster winner as the goal for the Hollywood movie studios. It's also incredibly thrilling, and our first clue that Steven Spielberg was really something.\n\nAlien (1979) — June 12. Oh, my. This is my nominee for scariest movie ever made — but perhaps it's because I was in the audience for the very first screening — a press screening in Manhattan — when I knew nothing about what I was about to experience.\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973) — June 19. This Academy Award-nominated classic, voted one of the American Film Institute's top 100 Films, features the coming-of-age of four teenagers on their last summer night before college. The movie established George Lucas, and is perhaps more endearing to me than Star Wars. I felt I could have been in American Graffiti (that's how close it came to my life experience) and that Lucas stole my record collection for the fabulous 41-song soundtrack.\n\nMeatballs (1979) — June 26.\n\nBack to the Future (1985) — July 3.\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) — July 10 (at 8 p.m.).\n\nSpaceballs (1987) — July 10 (at 10 p.m.).\n\nThe Shining (1980) — July 17. Another fascinating horror film, with elegant Stanley Kubrick storytelling from a Stephen King classic, and a marvelously manic Jack Nicholson performance.\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) — July 24. This movie is proof positive that not all sequels are inferior to the originals. This greatest of all chase films leaves the first Mad Max eating dust.\n\nThe Goonies (1985) — July 31.\n\nGAP'S WINNER: It's so fitting that within a month of being inducted into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame, Gap Mangione releases one of his best albums to date. Live in Toronto spotlights the pianist in a club performance as leader of a superb quintet, playing a combination of jazz standards, along with songs composed by himself and by his brother, Chuck.\n\nThe format is straight-ahead bop — not unlike the music Gap and Chuck first played in the Jazz Brothers days of the late '50s and early '60s. Helping propel much of the music are two fine saxophonists, Andy Weinzler and Pat LaBarbara. (Much of their playing offers the zest and vigor of old-fashioned jazz-cutting contests.)\n\nClearly, they also inspire Gap, who shines on his solos and in his comping behind the others. Talented Canadian bassist Neil Swainson holds up the rhythmic low end, while Steve Curry anchors expertly behind the drum kit.\n\nThe tunes include Chuck's \"Hey Baby,\" \"Between Races\" and \"Requerdo\" from the early Mangione book, and his well-known \"Land of Make Believe\" and lesser-known but gorgeous \"If You Know Me Any Longer Than Tomorrow.\" The standards are Leroy Anderson's rousing \"Serenata\" and Duke Pearson's \"Tribute to Brownie.\" Gap's originals are — \"Cinco de Mayo\" and \"Calypso for Janet,\" two tunes he wrote for his wife, the artist Janet Mangione. (One of her impressionistic paintings adorns the CD cover.)\n\nThis is a free-spirited romp, a wonderfully entertaining and masterful exploration of jazz by a Rochester treasure. Look for Live in Toronto in local stores, at amazon.com, or at gapmangione.com.\n\nAnd look for the quintet live, at the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival at 6 and 10 p.m. June 23 in the Rochester Club, playing music from the new disc. If you don't mind a drive west, the quintet is also performing 7 to 10 p.m. at The Medici House in East Aurora, southeast of Buffalo.

On Sundays, we do things a bit differently, focusing on one topic instead of five. In this week, we're looking forward to summer.\n\nOne of the things I like best about summer is the optimism, the weather, the gatherings, the cookouts, the sports. And for people like me, who live in cold weather places, we get to forget it snows half the year. What are you looking forward to this summer? Let me know @jamesbrowntv on Twitter, or email me at jabrown@usatoday.com.\n\nI asked that question to a few of my colleagues, and they told me what's coming up in the worlds of entertainment, politics and books. USA Today, Books Editor, Barbara Vandenburgh, says a sequel to one of our favorite films will be released in book form in the next few months. Entertain This, host Ralphie Aversa, says the legendary Quincy Jones is credited on the new Harry Styles album. And as USA Today, National Political correspondent, David Jackson, tells us, one of the most expensive congressional primaries ever is happening in an unlikely place.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have a returning champion. David Jackson's with us. How you been?\n\nDavid Jackson: Fine, sir. How are you?\n\nJames Brown: I'm doing great. I'm glad to have you back. I would love for you to break out your crystal ball. Just looking forward over the next couple of months, what are the big political stories, things that you know are coming, things that our listeners should be on the lookout for?\n\nDavid Jackson: Well, we know about a few things that are happening that are going to be quite interesting. One of them is the Congressional Committee that's investigating the insurrection of January 6th, 2021. They're going to be starting public hearings. I think the first one's on June 9th. And they're going to go through in pretty granular detail about Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the election last year and how it basically led to the attack on the US Capitol, on January 6th. So we're expecting a lot of interesting testimony and a lot of fireworks and basically a lot of Democrats accusing Trump of trying to be an election thief and a lot of Republicans saying that Democrats are politicizing legitimate complaints about the election. And we're expecting at least six public hearings and a lot of documentation to come out. So it'll go a long way towards being able to reconstruct what happened during those two months after the 2020 election.\n\nAnother event that we're expecting is the Supreme Court is going to hand out its real decision on abortion. We think that's going to happen in late June. Now, we've read a lot of stories about this preliminary opinion they have and it sure looks like the court is going to strike down the Roe versus Wade ruling from 1973, but that's just a draft opinion that's being circulated among the justice, that's not the final product. We're expecting that product to come out again in late June or early July. And that will just revive the firestorm over the abortion issue, which is liable to become a very big thing in the upcoming midterm elections in November. Democrats feel like it's an issue that can really boost their chances, where Republicans feel the same way. The anti-abortion faction has been a big vote getter for them in decades passed, and they seem to think that that will continue even after the Supreme Court gives them the ultimate victory in striking down Roe versus Wade. So, that's going to happen.\n\nWe're also going to continue to have primaries throughout the summer. Particularly the most interesting being in August when Wyoming Congresswoman, Liz Cheney, seeks reelection. She's of course, as the top target of Donald Trump. Trump's very mad at her because she voted to impeach him over January 6th. So he recruited a challenger to run against Cheney. And it's a multimedia... It's one of the most expensive house races of all... One of the most expensive house primaries of all time. So a lot of Republicans from across the country have poured money into that race and that's going to be in mid-August and it'll be Liz Cheney against a Wyoming Lord named Harriet Hageman. And that'll be an interesting test of Trump's influence in the Republican party, and good exposure on the divisions within that party is they move ahead to try to win control of Congress in November.\n\nJames Brown: When it comes to the Cheney race, are we talking hundreds of thousands, are we talking millions, are we talking tens of millions?\n\nDavid Jackson: In a per voter race, it's probably going to set the record for the most expensive. Got not a lot of voters in Wyoming, but there are already millions and millions of dollars being spent because a lot of traditional Republicans like Cheney, they don't like Donald Trump. So they're giving her money to try to hold onto her seat. And there's a lot of Trump money in Wyoming and across the country that's going to go all out to try to defeat her. So that's going to be a very expensive race in this liable set of records.\n\nJames Brown: Entertain This host, Ralphie Aversa, has one of the coolest jobs at USA Today. He interviews entertainers of all types. Here's a few of the things he's looking forward to this summer.\n\nRalphie Aversa: From a movie standpoint, I think it's headlined by Top Gun. And Top Gun: Maverick, obviously is going to come out Memorial Day weekend. And the review so far have been glowing. Tom Cruise told our Bryan Alexander at the premier in San Diego that he wanted to wait until this movie could be seen on the big screen, and now he gets that chance. And I think it's going to just have a massive summer. It's a big summer for movies, period though, because you have the new Jurassic World film as well, you have the new Thor film, you have a lot of things coming out, the Buzz Lightyear film as well, with Disney Pixar. So a lot of stuff to look forward to at the theaters.\n\nJames Brown: Really interesting on theaters, just in general. This is the first actual full summer back where you have a full slate where we will probably have packed theaters, I'm presuming.\n\nRalphie Aversa: It is hard to know, but that said, you have movies that certainly would warrant that. So we'll see how it plays out throughout the summer. You're also going to have back though, a full slate of live summer concerts and outdoor venues. I spoke this week with Pat Monahan, the band Train, just released its 11th studio album, AM Gold. And Pat, tongue in cheek, but I think he was being somewhat serious. He said, \"Look, if you're not going to come see us on tour...\" And they're doing all the outdoor amphitheaters with Jewel and Blues Traveler, \"Go see something, go see some live music.\" We were deprived of it for so long and we've lost so many greats over the past couple of years. Go see someone and have that live music, human experience. And I'm really looking forward to that being back this summer as well.\n\nJames Brown: I think he makes a really great point there and I like Train. I've seen Blues Traveler, and I don't think I've seen Jewel. I totally would be down to go see them.\n\nRalphie Aversa: Absolutely. I think in so many different cities across the country, you have these outdoor venues that for the most part have gone unused over the past two, two and a half years. And so a lot of those amphitheaters will see jam packed audiences, and those lawns will be filled and you'll be able to experience a lot of live music, which will be cool.\n\nJames Brown: What else is on your plate? What else jumps out to you, comes to mind over the next few months?\n\nRalphie Aversa: From a TV standpoint, obviously you have these Stranger Things season coming out, obviously. So, that is gaining a lot of press. And that will be, I think, talked about throughout the summer on Netflix. And then from a music standpoint, this weekend is a big weekend for music, obviously not just with Train and some other releases, but Harry Styles. The Harry styles album, it's his third solo LP. It's called Harry's House. Our Melissa Ruggieri, reviewed it and gave it a pretty glowing review. He's going to be performing this weekend at UBS Arena on Long Island. And then of course he'll be performing as well. But when you're at Harry's level, you're not just doing outdoor amphitheaters, you're doing arenas. And I'm sure for him, stadiums, which he used to do with One Direction, aren't that far away either.\n\nAnd so the new Harry album, I got to say, I've been listening to it. We're covering it this weekend for USA Today's, Entertain This. It is really, really good. So it's great to see good Pop. I'm a big fan of Pop music. You mentioned I was in radio. For those who don't know I was in radio for a number of years primarily and was on Pop Radio. And so a good Pop song always catches me.\n\nJames Brown: You got a favorite track?\n\nRalphie Aversa: Quincy Jones has a co-write on the new Harry Styles album because he sampled a 1978 song from The Brothers Johnson. It's a song called Daydreaming, on Harry's album, and it's probably my favorite.\n\nJames Brown: USA Today, Books Editor, Barbara Vandenburgh, and I don't have a ton in common, except a mutual favorite crime movie. Our listeners can't see you right now, but I can, and I see a stack of books right behind you. Is that emblematic of your life?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Yes, it's a problem. There are 10 of these scattered throughout the house. It's a fire hazard. If this house ever catches on fire, I'm screwed. It's all books.\n\nJames Brown: Do you get promos? Do you get books earlier than the rest of us?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Oh yes. Yes, basically if I... Unless it's a really scandalous celebrity tell all memoir, if I want a book early, I just need to reach out to the publisher and they'll send it to me, which is a power I try not to abuse, but it's very exciting to get all of the books early. It's ruined me. I can never have another job because then I'll never get the books early. So, you guys are stuck with me.\n\nJames Brown: I could read it all over your face. The joy as you articulate, \"Hey, I get all the books early.\" Yes, it's...\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Right? As far as jobs go, it's not a bad one.\n\nJames Brown: So tell me about the books that you're really excited about this summer.\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Well, a book that actually literally just came out last week is one that I'm really excited about and that I think people are going to love. It's called This Time Tomorrow, by Emma Straub. It's a really delightful take on the time travel story, and it plays interestingly with time travel tropes. So it's a novel and it's about this girl, Alice, who... She's about to turn 40, which resonates with me because I just turned 40. And she falls asleep on her 40th birthday and she wakes up and she finds herself 16 years old, again.\n\nSo very much like a 13 going on 30, situation but in reverse. She's got the perspective of a 40 year old, but she's 16 again. And it gives her a different perspective on her father, who's 40 years old himself. And she sees now, what he was going through at the time and better appreciates it. And it just... It's a really charming book. It's really clever. It has a lot of interesting things to say about hitting this first phase of midlife and it's full of elder millennial nostalgia and Pop culture. That as somebody who was a teenager in the 90's really resonated with me. I think this book is going to be... It's going to do huge. I'll be surprised if it doesn't get turned into a movie.\n\nJames Brown: Well, tell me about the nostalgia. I am an elder millennial myself. I just turned 38. Why would we notice?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Oh, the music, the movie. She wakes up in her bedroom and has a poster of the movie, Reality Bites, in her bedroom. And so it goes down on a Reality Bites, memory lane walk and yes, just absolutely chock full, but not in an obnoxious way, of Pop culture references and callbacks. And if you were a teenager in the 90's, you're going to recognize it.\n\nJames Brown: Well, what else is around the corner?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: I'm really excited to read a book coming out June 7th. It's a novel by the author, Kali Fajardo-Anstine, called Woman of Light. Now, Kali Fajardo-Anstine, is a native and Latina author from Colorado. She's a national book award finalist for her short story collection, Sabrina and Corina, which came out a couple years ago. So this is her first novel. It's a multi-generational historical tale set in the American west. And it tells the story of Luz \"Little Light\" Lopez, a tea leaf reader and laundress, who begins to have visions of her ancestors and the forces that have threatened her indigenous family.\n\nSo, Kali Fajardo-Anstine, is a really, really beautiful writer. Sabrina and Corina is a gorgeous collection of stories. She knows how to write a sentence. But I'm really interested in reading a Western that centers indigenous voices and experiences that isn't about the typical white cowboy, really excited to see what she does with this. I think it's going to be really big because her short story collection was just phenomenal.\n\nJames Brown: If you were to, based on what you know, pick the blockbuster that nobody's talking about, to come, what would it be?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Well, I don't know about the blockbuster. I can tell you about the blockbuster probably everybody's talking about.\n\nJames Brown: Tell me about it.\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Heat 2, by Michael Mann and Meg Gardiner. So did you ever see the 1995 film, Heat, starring Robert de Niro and Al Pacino?\n\nJames Brown: I love that film.\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: It's an amazing film.\n\nJames Brown: Pacino and de Niro together? When? That never happens. There's a book?\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: Yes. So Michael Mann, who directed Heat, one of the all time great filmmakers. I love Michael Mann. He's teamed up with the Edgar award-winning thriller writer, Meg Gardiner. She's great. And they've written a sequel to that 1995 film, Heat. So it continues the film's story, it's exploring the gritty world of international crime organization, and the agents who investigate them. I have not read it yet. I am dying to read it. I love Heat, and I am so excited by the prospect that maybe they'll turn this into a movie. Maybe we're going to get a film sequel to Heat. And I'm just salivating at the prospect.\n\nJames Brown: As am I, I'm thrilled. Barbara Vandenburgh, thank you for joining me on 5 Things.\n\nBarbara Vandenb...: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.\n\nJames Brown: If you liked the show, write us a review on apple podcast or wherever you're listening, and do me a favor, share it with a friend. Thanks to Ralphie Aversa, David Jackson, and Barbara Vandenburgh, for joining me. I can't wait to have them all back.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to this summer?

We also shared our favorite Carell and Carrey flicks (as well as a few of their duds) ahead of the release of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, and, took a look at the films making a splash at this year's SXSW festival. Finally we answered readers' questions about Jupiter Ascending, potential Oscar categories, and Oz sequels.\n\nBrian Truitt: Welcome to the USA TODAY Movie Forum!\n\nI'm Brian Truitt, USA TODAy entertainment writer and all-around nerd, and I will serve as your moderator and chatter. Joining me today is USA TODAY movie reporter Scott Bowles.\n\nHow this works - Each week we solicit questions, online, from our readers on the latest news from the world of film.\n\nThis week we're talking about the year's first big earner, Oz, and what it means for the box office year to come. And with the release of The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, we'll discuss our favorite Carell and Carrey flicks (as well as a few of their duds).\n\nScott and I will start by sharing our thoughts on this week's topics, then we will move on to reader-submitted questions.\n\nSO…let's get the Forum started!\n\nScott, I think a lot of people predicted Oz would open numero uno, but maybe not $80 million worth. Is that what you were expecting?\n\nScott Bowles: Welcome moviegoers. Thanks for pulling yourself away from the papal election.\n\nAs for Oz, that's about $10 million more than anyone expected, including myself. This is the first breakout hit of the year, and ample fodder for theater owners who say there aren't enough blockbusters in spring. What did you think of it, Mr. Truitt?\n\nBrian Truitt: I was expecting around the same, Scott. I figured around 70, but I think it spoke to how much families were just waiting for something to go to the movie for. Bullet to the Head probably didn't do much for them. And I think it also speaks to how classic that Oz world still is. Plus, Sam Raimi doesn't make too many bad flicks.\n\nScott Bowles: That's a good point. Little was made of Sam directing it, and he pulled off something nearly as impressive as Spider-Man.\n\nOf course, at a reported $325 million, it's going to have to have long legs at the box office.\n\nIt's made headway toward profitability overseas, where it did $70 million, the highest region being, of all places, Russia, where there's nyet place like home.\n\nYou see long legs for this, Brian? Why do you think it worked so well?\n\nBrian Truitt: I think it will have legs for a few weeks. Burt Wonderstone is opening this weekend, and I don't think it has the same kid-friendliness that Oz does. Come on, flying monkeys? Witches? Kids live for that stuff. Plus I think folks are still looking for some escapism.\n\nHow long do you see this ruling the box office, Scott? And do you think we might have turned the corner in terms of a down box office this year?\n\nScott Bowles: I agree. I think we may have underestimated the collective love of the Emerald City.\n\nAs for the box office slate, this year has a loooong way to go. The sequels of summer are going to have to be big to set another record year.\n\nAnd as for its legs, I think you're right. Families are going to choose Oz, couples Wonderstone. It really doesn't have competition until Nic Cage's The Croods in a week and a half.\n\nBrian Truitt: Ah, good point. I think The Croods will send it back to Kansas packing - or at least to No. 2. You can't beat Nic Cage voicing a caveman. And then G.I. Joe Retaliation then begins the summer movie season somewhat early - and explodingly - come March 28.\n\nNow, on to The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, the new comedy with Steve Carell in a mullet and Jim Carrey being weird. (A stretch, I know.) What do you think of its prospects for these two guys, and just for a magic movie in general?\n\nScott Bowles: This one looks like a winner, much like 40 year old Virgin. The title, the poster, all scream dork hit.\n\nAnd this is a good time of the year for a comedy. Look at what Identity Thief did: $116 million and counting. I expect at least that much.\n\nYou a magic fan, Brian?\n\nBrian Truitt:Magic Mike pretty much did nothing for me, but that's not the kind of magic I am into. (I did want to escape from watching that, but that's beside the point.) But I am a Carellaholic and I love his stuff. 40 Year Old Virgin is still one of my favorite movies, and his lines from Anchorman are classic. Do you have a favorite Steve Carell movie, Scott?\n\nScott Bowles:Anchorman remains my favorite Carell work, aside from The Office. As for Jim Carrey, who plays the rival magician, he's the wildcard. I'm a fan of his serious stuff -- The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind -- but this could be up his alley.\n\nHere's my question, as a (very) amateur magician: Why are there so few movies about magic? Is that too dorky for big screen renditions?\n\nBrian Truitt:Ace Ventura will always, always be my favorite Jim Carrey movie. Though his turn in the upcoming Kick-Ass 2 as a superhero soldier looks kinda funny too.\n\nI do not know why there aren't many magician movies. I think it's a very niche thing that's really big in Vegas and the Magic Castle in LA, which is super popular. Then again superheroes are a niche thing, too, and they're pretty much everywhere. I think magic to many is an analog art form of yesteryear that much of today's generation doesn't quite get. Not to say they shouldn't learn a good card trick or two to impress the ladies. Do you have any insight on the lack of magic flicks, Scott?\n\nScott Bowles: Yeah. We are a slighted bunch.\n\nSeriously, since you can make any image you want on screen, it takes away from the mystery of magic.\n\nStill, there are a couple good ones. Houdini, The Prestige. I'm not sure Steve Carell can bring a comedy to those heights, but at least he's trying a little sleight of hand.\n\nBrian Truitt: Oh yeah, Prestige was awesome. All Chris Nolan fans should see that one.\n\nAnd moving on ... to Austin and the South by Southwest Festival. A few major movies premiered there over the weekend at the festival, namely Joss Whedon's Bard-esque Much Ado About Nothing, the remake of Evil Dead and the James Franco vice vehicle Spring Breakers. Any of these you're looking forward to when they hit the theaters, Scott?\n\nScott Bowles:Spring Breakers may be a party flick with an edge. On first glance, it looks like a Girls Gone Wild with semi-automatics. But this is supposed to take a darker look at characters with canyons for hearts.\n\nWhat about you, Brian. This seems like a fanboys feast coming up...\n\nBrian Truitt: It does. I dig me some Whedon so I think him getting his crew back together for a modern take on Shakespeare sounds fun. Plus, I will see anything with Nathan Fillion in it. And I am hearing some crazy good things about Evil Dead. I do love the old one with Bruce Campbell, but this one sounds like it ups the gore and turns down the camp a smidge.\n\nAlrighty, now on to some reader questions!\n\nMaryann Orlando in Flemington, New Jersey asks:\n\nWhat do you know (so far) about the film JUPITER ASCENDING; writers/directors Andy and Lana Wachowski; cast member Eddie Redmayne?\n\nScott Bowles: Ah, the Wachowski siblings. They're an interesting pair that's been hard to read since The Matrix trilogy ended with a whimper or bang, depending on your take.\n\nSince then, though, it's hard to argue they've been in need of a hit. Their sprawling opus, Cloud Atlas, was expected to be a box office hit and an awards contender. Instead it went down as the flop of the most expensive independent film ever made ($100 million).\n\nAs for Jupiter, there's little out about it. But it's got hot actors including Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis.\n\nWhat think, Truitt? Is this the Neo of 2014?\n\nBrian Truitt: I would not go that far, although C-Tates in black leather and sunglasses would probably help their bottom line.\n\nScott Bowles: For the uninitiated, the synopsis goes as follows:In a universe where humans are near the bottom of the evolutionary ladder, a young destitute human woman is targeted for assassination by the Queen of the Universe because her very existence threatens to end the Queen's reign.\n\nBrian Truitt: I think Cloud Atlas might have been doomed a bit by having four different time lines and actors playing all sorts of characters. I didn't think that would play to a really broad audience. However, I think people can wrap their heads better around this plot, where humans are the lower-class of the galaxy and the fact that there is a Queen of the Universe. I bet she's not very nice.\n\nI have known a few women who thought they were Queen of the Universe. Not so much.\n\nScott Bowles: What do you think about the Wachowskis since Matrix, Brian? They've found limited success in V for Vendetta, but seem to have lost their edge, at least with moviegoers.\n\nBrian Truitt:V for Vendetta is one of those movies that people will look back on and see how awesome it was in retrospect down the line. The plot is much better than the Matrix as a whole. And really, holding them up to the Matrix trilogy is not doing them any favors. The first movie was good, but the other two were iffy. The third was the sci-fi action storytelling equivalent of a faceplant.\n\nScott Bowles: I worry that the original Matrix was lightning in a bottle.\n\nBrian Truitt:Speed Racer was interesting though and I think they should do more stuff like that.\n\nYeah, I do not think they have another Matrix in them, but they may surprise. They do have the power of C-Tates on their side.\n\nLuke from the Southwest asks:\n\nNow that the Oscars are over, I have thought of some good awards that should totally be in future Oscar ceremonies\n\n\n\nBest Voice Actor\n\nBest Supporting Voice Actor\n\nBest Voice Actress\n\nBest Supporting Voice Actress\n\nBest Action Picture\n\nBest Comedy Picture\n\nBest Drama Picture\n\nBest Producing\n\nBest Animated Foreign Language\n\nInnovation (this could be a Special Achievement Award)\n\nBest Made-for-television Picture\n\nBest Animation (for the best way of animating an animated film)\n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\nScott Bowles: Hi Luke. You clearly used The Force to come up with these categories.\n\nAnd I like every one of them. The problem, though, is that the Academy Awards already seem too splintered in its individual races, which tends to bloat the telecast.\n\nIf I were the Oscar producers, I'd rip off The Golden Globes, which stick to big stars, big categories. And, technically, Best Producing is the Best Picture race, which goes to producer.\n\nBut I like the list, especially comedy. What categories do you want to see, Brian?\n\nAnd what about best car chase? (A Good Day to Die Hard). Best brain splatter (Bullet to the Head). Biggest flop? Last year might have been Battleship.\n\nBrian Truitt: I think sticking to the one best pic is still the best option - i would seriously end up in a fetal position if somehow Adam Sandler came away with an Oscar. Made for TV movies are over in the Globes and Emmys. Best action pic I wouldn't mind just being a fanboy. But I think you do have a point with voice talent. While I would just do a best voice actor and actress, and no supporting, I think that would lend some respect to animation on the whole and what they do.\n\nI am still waiting for Most Awesome Movie Oscar. So Highlander can win every year.\n\nJakeem from Atlanta asks:\n\nNow that ʺOz the Great and Powerfulʺ is a box-office success, is it safe to assume we'll be seeing more film versions of L. Frank Baum's stories?\n\nScott Bowles: Great question, Jakeem, though I'd have to say no. While studios like to mine hits from similar genres, they tend not to be loyal to writers.\n\nWhich is a shame, because Oz has worked in just about every format: Musical, play, summer blockbuster. Why not explore Baum's world more?\n\nScott Bowles: But I don't know that's he's considered as box office friendly as, say, Dr. Seuss.\n\nBrian Truitt: It'd be great to see more stuff of his just to show what else he did other than the Ozian world, which is pretty classic. But it's the same thing as JM Barrie and Peter Pan - they're known for these worlds and people will always keep coming back to them. Heck, we still have Dorothy of Oz still coming later this year.\n\nHowever, I do like what Gregory Maguire and others have done though and taken what Baum created and expanded upon and given it a richer mythology. It might be sacrilege to some, but much like with Star Wars, sometimes a world is better the more builders it has.\n\nThat should be about it for us today, folks. Thanks for submitting questions and hanging out with us today, and thanks to Scott for giving his insight.\n\nScott Bowles: Thank you, guys!\n\nBrian Truitt: Remember: you can submit your burning movie questions all week long, right here.\n\nBrian Truitt: Thank you all for joining us for the USA TODAY Movie Forum!

Everything from lavish jewelry, vintage clothing, delicate tea sets and figurines or furniture can be found at these stores. Some fan favorites include Antique Galleries of Palm Springs and Market Market in Palm Springs and Victoria's Attic Antique Mall in Rancho Mirage. And if an antique store is out of your price range, there's always something interesting to find at a thrift store as well. They might have a smaller collection, but you can snag some retro pieces of furniture or home decor if you're lucky.\n\nWhen: Check store websites for hours\n\nWhere:Antique Galleries of Palm Springs, 505 Industrial Place Suite AR, Palm Springs; Market Market, 1555 S.

Standing tall at more than 8,500 feet of elevation, Mount San Jacinto State Park provides more than 50 miles of hiking trails and beautiful scenery to take in. If you're not a big hiker, you can take in the views while enjoying a drink at Peaks Restaurant, learn some cool facts at the natural history museum and grab a souvenir at the gift shop.\n\nWhen: Summer hours (May 23–Sept. 1) are as follows:\n\nMonday-Friday: First tram up at 10 a.m.\n\nSaturday, Sunday and Holidays: First tram up at 8 a.m.\n\nSunday-Thursday: Last tram up at 8 p.m., last tram down at 9:30 p.m.\n\nFriday and Saturday: Last tram up at 9 p.m., last tram down at 10:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, 1 Tram Way, Palm Springs\n\nCost: $$$\n\nSpend a lavish day on El Paseo\n\nShop till you drop on El Paseo, essentially the Coachella Valley's version of Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive.

The Palm Springs Surf Club is your ticket to shredding some sick waves, or at least giving it a try. Daily private and public surf sessions are available depending on one's skill level. Though they come with hefty price tags (around $200-$250 per person for public sessions; upwards of $4,500 for a private one), if you go with the latter option, it's an activity you can split among a few friends to drive down the price, but increase the fun. The surf club also offers general admission passes, which grant access to the lazy river, water slides and splash pads.

Friends of the Desert Mountains is a nonprofit partner of the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument and its goal is to connect and educate people about the beauty around them. The organization has a number of fun experiences lined up this summer, including sunset yoga with park rangers, Tortoise Chats where guests can learn about these desert dwellers, stargazing events and more.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/05/25/delaware-beach-guide-a-locals-guide-to-rehoboth-lewes-dewey-more/70153728007/", "title": "Rehoboth, Dewey & beyond: Local's look at all you need to know ...", "text": "We feel sorry for those in the region who only know the Jersey Shore or Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nSure, they are bigger than the Delaware beaches and have more to do, but they seem a bit, uh, soulless compared with the character found at our summertime playgrounds.\n\nLewes has the feel of a small New England port town with Stephen King writing a novel in a house overlooking the quaint Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.\n\nRehoboth Beach has a mighty melange of families seeking fun, candy, games and rides, along with an established LGBTQ community that helps make it stand out from its competitors with big boardwalks.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nJust south, Dewey Beach may still be a run-and-run town for the young (and young at heart) looking to bar-hop, but it's growing into more than that as more families visit and also settle down in what once were group beach houses.\n\nBethany Beach is the opposite of Dewey with a small boardwalk and sleepier feel known as \"The Quiet Resorts\" in tandem with Fenwick Island, the smallest of Delaware's beach towns ― and the closest to the way Delaware's beaches once were before development took over years ago.\n\nWith five coastal Delaware towns to choose from within 25 miles of each other, it can be tricky to figure out what's right for you and your fellow beach-goers.\n\nTo help, the Delaware Online/The News Journal newsroom brainstormed a local's guide to Delaware's beaches to help point the way.\n\nWhether you want to let loose at a beach bar, take a quiet nature walk or escape a rainstorm with the family for some indoor shenanigans, we have plenty of ideas because we've done them all ourselves.\n\nWith the temperatures rising, it's time to grab your bathing suit and soak in some sun.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nIf you're searching for the classic American summer beach experience, Rehoboth and its milelong Boardwalk, which dates back to 1873, is the place for you.\n\nSoaked in nostalgia, it's the land of beach umbrellas, saltwater taffy, and, of course, hungry seagulls looking for a runaway french fry.\n\nIts main drag, Rehoboth Avenue, is packed with non-chain shops and eateries, and you'll find the LGBTQ-heavy Baltimore Avenue just a block away.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nA beach scene. A foodie scene. A gay scene. That's the reason Rehoboth is Delaware's favorite playground for so many.\n\nIt's where President Joe Biden has his summer beach house in North Shores, sometimes seen riding bikes on the Gordons Pond Trail located in Cape Henlopen State Park. NBC News \"Today\" co-anchor Hoda Kotb also has a home here, often seen on the Boardwalk or at Browseabout Books, a beloved independent bookstore that dates back to 1975.\n\nOther celebrities spotted over the years: Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, NBA great Michael Jordan, actor Denzel Washington, auteur John Waters, TV host Kathie Lee Gifford, actor Richard Gere and even U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBy day, the sun and the beach rule with shopping at the town's bountiful boutiques a close second. By night, you can stroll the romantic alleyways lit by string lights where they serve crepes and sell tie-dye after a fine dining experience.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nThere are some staples that have become so intertwined with the town that it's almost a crime not to stop in at least once, if not to just taste what generations of beachgoers have been drawn to.\n\nGrotto Pizza's \"legendary taste\" has several locations in town with its distinctive sauce swirl and use of a mild cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Traditionalists should try a couple of other family-owned hometown favorites: Louie's Pizza (since 1974) and Nicola Pizza (since 1971, but now located on Route 1), also home to their famous \"Nic-o-boli\" strombolis.\n\nBesides pizza, the Ocean City, Maryland-founded Thrasher’s with its three Rehoboth locations is a go-to for French fries for decades (try with salt and vinegar!), along with the more down-home Boardwalk legend, Gus & Gus Place. Other Boardwalk spots that have lines for good reason: Kohr Brothers (soft-serve frozen custard), The Ice Cream Store (100-plus varieties of ice cream) and Dolle's (saltwater taffy and caramel popcorn).\n\nBut Rehoboth is much more than beach food for the masses. In fact, its restaurant scene just may arguably be the best in the state, ranging from breweries armed with impressive kitchens to fine dining spots that have foodies flocking.\n\nThe Back Porch Cafe is a classic, splurge-worthy restaurant where \"everything but the baguettes\" are made in-house.\n\nOther favorites include Houston White Co. for steaks and red wine, Lupo Italian Kitchen's to try shaved Brussels sprouts and lobster bucatini, and Henlopen City Oyster House for its impeccable raw oysters and other seafood dishes that never fail to please. Salt Air also has seafood that keeps people coming back, along with a banana cream cake dreams are made of.\n\nMariachi Restaurant is a favorite for Mexican and Latin-American foods, along with Dos Locos with its unique mid-Atlantic take on Mexican food. For Asian cuisine, The Cultured Pearl Restaurant & Sushi Bar is the GOAT for sushi with Stingray as another favorite and Confucius, which boasts an array of upscale Chinese dishes.\n\nFor breakfast, the newly-expanded Egg is a cool spot with inventive offerings such as siracha bacon \"candy\" and a peanut butter French toast sandwich. But if you're really hungry (and hungover), the Crystal Restaurant is a more traditional down-home diner-type setting that draws long waits at peak times.\n\nBars near the beach: Here are 5 new spots for nightlife & bites at Delaware beaches this summer\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nRehoboth Beach has its own King of Beers: Dogfish Head Brewing & Eats. Founded in town in 1995, the brand has helped put Rehoboth on the map, drawing beer tourists from around the world.\n\nPurple Parrot Grill’s outdoor biergarten is a fun detour tucked off Rehoboth Avenue with indoor fun including karaoke and DJs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, drawing gay and straight alike.\n\nOther LGBTQ hot spots include AQUA Bar & Grill with a deck that acts as a magnet for day-drinking fun-seekers, along with Rigby's Bar & Grill, Freddie's Beach Bar & Restaurant (a spinoff of the Arlington, Virginia, spot) and Diego's Bar & Nightclub, which boasts an outdoor, sand-filled patio.\n\nAnd if you really want a taste of the local scene, drop into the original Arena's Deli and Bar downtown where deli sandwiches and a full bar collide with live local music Thursday through Sunday during the summer.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe drag scene at Blue Moon, which melds dining with stage shows since 1981, is unmatched. Drag shows sometimes join karaoke at Purple Parrot as well. The LGBTQ organization CAMP Rehoboth has its own arts and culture offerings, as well as Clear Space Theatre Company with its own renditions of musicals and other shows all summer long.\n\nFor live music, Dogfish has a large stage, making bands as important as the beer, just like founder Sam Calagione likes it. You'll find a mix of local, regional and even national acts on their calendar. And if you're willing to head out to the highway, The Pond has local live music nightly, anchored by Thursday nights with hometown standbys Lower Case Blues featuring guitar slinger Jake Banaszak and funky bassist B.J. Muntz.\n\nFor families looking for live music, the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand has it all, ranging from tribute acts and orchestras to local cover bands and military bands. It's been free since first launching in 1963 just off the Boardwalk, giving musicians and fans alike beautiful views and an ocean breeze.\n\nFor the kiddos (and grown kiddos), Funland amusement park (first opened in 1961) is a must-stop with rides and games right on the Boardwalk, with five generations of the Fasnacht family working to keep the throwback just like parents remember from their own childhood.\n\nAbove Ryan's Beach Shop you'll find an 18-hole mini-golf course with killer panoramic views. And if you head out to the highway, Jungle Jim's water park with its waterslides, go-karts and bumper boats is a freshwater alternative to the ocean.\n\nWhat do I need to know about parking?\n\nIf you visit Delaware's biggest beach town, also expect the biggest beach crowds. If you plan to park in a metered space, you're going to be spending a fair amount of time looking for one.\n\nRehoboth Beach parking is by meter or permit only between May 15 and Sept. 15. Meters run 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., while permits are only enforced through 5 p.m.\n\nMeters are $3 an hour and can be paid with quarters or via ParkMobile. Download it before you get there to save a headache. If you're into masochism, change machines are available at the following locations:\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue at First Street,\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue across from City Hall,\n\nThe Parking Department, 1 City Hall Drive\n\nRehoboth has two metered parking lots, off Christian Street next to the senior center and off Rehoboth Avenue next to the Fire Department.\n\nClick here for a map of Rehoboth Beach parking areas.\n\nPermits can be purchased at the Parking Department or from multiple kiosks throughout town. Check the city's website for hours.\n\nDon't forget: All perpendicular or angled parking in Rehoboth Beach, except handicapped, is head-in only.\n\nIf just the thought of spot-hunting on a summer day in Rehoboth causes a blood pressure spike, try DART First State's Park & Ride on the highway. The air-conditioned buses will drop you off at the Bandstand and are able to get you there quicker than a car thanks to bus-only lanes.\n\nWhat do I need to know about the beach?\n\nOnce on the beach, there are no tents, tarps, cabanas, pavilions or canopies allowed, except for small baby tents that must be anchored. Beach umbrellas must not be wider than 7 feet, 6 inches wide.\n\nExpect to be very close to your neighbors. If you have pearls to clutch, leave them at home.\n\nThe entire 2-mile area of beach within the corporate city limits is guarded between Memorial Day and Labor Day, weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're into surf-fishing, it's only permitted when lifeguards are off-duty, except for the beach area between the jetty north of the Henlopen Hotel and 250 feet north. Of course, you'll need a Delaware fishing license.\n\nSorry, pet owners. Dogs are not allowed on the beach or boardwalk between May 1 and Sept. 30.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nThe 6-mile Junction Breakwater Trail from Rehoboth Beach to Lewes gets crowded, but it’s a good option for soft-surface running or walking. For a longer workout, you can connect to the 8-mile Lewes-Georgetown Trail.\n\nGrove Park Canal Dock now hosts Cape Water Tours & Taxi, which offers tours, cruises and taxi service from the dock, much as they do on the Rehoboth and Delaware bays.\n\nAlso, try Cape Henlopen State Park and Gordons Pond to the north or follow the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal south to Thompson Island Preserve.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen raindrops fall, the family-owned Movies at Midway on Coastal Highway is a longtime favorite, as is shopping nearby at Tanger Outlets, also located on the highway.\n\nIf you have wheels, you can also drive out to Dogfish Head's brewery in Milton, located about 13 miles away. It is there where you can get a tour, sip their specialties and eat in the Tasting Room & Kitchen.\n\nThe aforementioned Purple Parrot is a fun place for rainy day drinking and Browseabout Books also offers refuge of a different kind.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, the Fourth of July is the star of the show. When the city hosts its annual fireworks display, a city with only about 1,500 year-round residents draws up to 100,000 some years who fill every square inch of the beach, Boardwalk and sidewalk that can be found. (Get there early and stay late to avoid the nightmare traffic jam each year.)\n\nA Piping Out the Summer parade is held on the Boardwalk on Labor Day to close out the season and The Sea Witch Festival attracts thousands of revelers during the Halloween season, making it well worth an autumnal return to Rehoboth. Also in the fall, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival draws national acts to the beach, playing on stages throughout town.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe Bellmoor Inn & Spa may be an expensive place to stay, but if you like bougie, the breakfast in the morning (free with your stay) is worth it. They have made-to-order omelets and a very nice buffet spread. The hotel now has a bar and you can take your cocktails and sit in the lush courtyard.\n\nAnd when it comes to shopping, boutiques abound, including Bella Luna and its eclectic jewelry, gifts, decor and artwork. For surf shops, try Quiet Storm and Sierra Moon. And to go back in time, '60s-themed Sunshine Octopus has tie-dye, while Gidgets Gadgets has vinyl and retro toys.\n\nDelaware history: 8 things to know about newly restored World War II tower in Delaware Seashore State Park\n\nDewey Beach\n\nOnly 20 blocks long and two blocks deep, Dewey is a unique strip at Delaware's beaches, best known for its nightlife.\n\nWhile Dewey can still party hard, the days of the Girls Gone Wild bus stopping in town seem to be long gone as Dewey has grown up a bit over the past decade or so.\n\nMore family-friendly events have been rolled out as the number of families who live in town or visit for vacation has risen a bit.\n\nEven so, summer weekends are dominated by masses of day-and-night drinkers, bopping from bar to bar in search of cover bands and fun.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nDewey is home to only about 300 people year-round, but that number swells in the summer as group beach houses begin to fill, some housing 20 or more people.\n\nBar-hopping in Dewey is as commonplace as reaching for water and aspirin in the morning to soothe a raging hangover. But the town is more than its drinkables.\n\nThere's a cool surfer scene on the ocean side, Rehoboth Bay offers more relaxed water fun, and there are even movies on the beach for the kids.\n\nWhile there are plenty of adults in town (even if some act like children when drunk), the town's relaxed beach vibe also draws teens and tweens running around with lacrosse sticks and skateboards.\n\nThe town's motto is \"A Way of Life\" and it is. With out-of-towners dominating, it still has a tight-knit feel. If you go enough, everyone will know your name, especially if you dress in a ridiculous costume, which is still a familiar Dewey sight.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nSure, Dewey is filled with quick bites. Perhaps the most famous was Mama Celeste's Pizzeria, located next to The Starboard, one of the biggest and most beloved bars in the state, never mind Dewey. Mama Celeste's owners \"Mama\" and \"Papa\" retired in the off-season and it will be open this year as the new Starboard Sauced, serving New York-style slices to late-night hordes of hungry bar-goers. Celeste \"Mama\" Gutt will be working there some days, so you may see her familiar face behind the counter.\n\nBut for a more proper meal, you have to visit Woody's Dewey Beach, best known for its award-winning crab cakes since 2009. It's small. It's busy. It's worth it. They even ship their crab cakes across the country for those who can't make the trip to the beach.\n\nThose looking for healthier options in the land of pizza and fries have found a home at Gary's Dewey Beach Grill, where hummus platters, salads, turkey breast cheesesteaks and sushi are served, along with fresh beer brewed on-site.\n\nIn fact, it's another brewery in town that just may have the best menu: Dewey Beer Co. Its slightly higher-end offerings have more of a Rehoboth Beach restaurant scene feel, allowing for more civilized meals of shrimp and chorizo lo mein, chicken & waffles and steak sandwiches.\n\nThe Starboard is a favorite for brunch, especially their weekly \"Suicide Sunday\" celebrations with a massive Bloody Mary bar and a singing Elvis impersonator wandering around the bar. For an open-air lunch under a roof with live music, try Jimmy's Grille Dewey, best known for its fried chicken.\n\nAlso, the old Hammerheads will be replaced by the new Starboard Claw.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nDid you say drink? You're in the right town.\n\nThere are four major bars, all with their own vibe and all within a half-mile.\n\nWe'll start with The Starboard, the iconic bar with a shark head busting out of the top of the building. A hodgepodge of bar rooms, the 'Board is home to the best Orange Crush in town. It's not even close. They are served in 16-ounce cups with oversized straws for extra-easy drinking and come in many flavors: orange, grapefruit, lemon, watermelon, mango and more. Throw in DJs, live music and celebrities (we're looking at you, Delaware native Ryan Phillippe) and you have a night to remember ... or perhaps a night to try to remember.\n\nThe other three major watering holes are owned by the same restaurant group so you'll see a lot of the same acts, drinks and people. Still, each is a unique slice of Dewey.\n\nThe Rusty Rudder with its large deck and Rehoboth Bay views is more easy-going during the day and turns up at night with cover bands. Local legends Love Seed Mama Jump have a Thursday night residency there that has been going for decades.\n\nFour blocks north is northbeach, also located along the bay with killer sunset views. A sandy patio along the water is the perfect place to try the bar's signature frozen Dewey Devil drink. The bar draws a younger crowd, especially at night, encouraged by DJs and dancing inside.\n\nA block from northbeach is the Bottle & Cork, a 21-only nightclub that hosts national acts with a schedule that has been weighted more toward modern country in recent years. But it's the Cork's Saturday \"Jam Session\" that makes it special. The tradition begins at 5 p.m. and usually rotates three to four cover bands until 1 a.m. A sea of crushed beer cans cover the ground by the end.\n\nOther spots to hit include Hawaiian-themed Nalu Surf Bar & Grill, Dewey Beach Country Club (a golf-themed bar, not an actual golf course) and The Lighthouse, a long-serving favorite recently rebuilt after a fire.\n\nAnd Dewey Beer Co. has more than good food — it boasts the top-ranked beers in the state.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nNearly every bar in town hosts cover acts or DJs, some both day and night. It's what Dewey does and it does it well.\n\nIn addition, the town added Nick's Mini Golf recently, a small course where Ed's Chicken and Crabs stood until a single-car accident caused a fire in 2016.\n\nAnother family-friendly idea is the free weekly movie nights on the beach, a partnership between Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce and the town of Dewey Beach. Films screen Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on the beach at Dagsworthy Street. Glow necklaces are available for a $1 donation.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nSeasonal parking permits are available for those staying in town awhile. You can purchase them via an automated kiosk outside of the Town Hall, at 105 Rodney Ave., or online.\n\nOtherwise, between May 15 and Sept. 15, the ParkMobile app makes paying (and adding time) much easier. Metered spaces are $3 an hour. Some take coins but not all.\n\nMore:More sand coming to Delaware beaches faster. Schedule moved up as another dredger arrives.\n\nBe warned: Finding a metered spot in Dewey can take time and patience in the summer. But there is a silver lining: Parking in Dewey is free Monday through Wednesday from 5 to 11 p.m. Also, those with handicapped license plates or placards park for free.\n\nAs for the actual beach, rules allow surf fishing, bonfires with a permit and dogs before 9:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. during the summer.\n\nCanopies, umbrellas and open-sided tents are permitted on the beach, but should be behind the lifeguard stands so they can see the water. No alcohol is allowed on the beach during the summer.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nDewey Beach Watersports is your gateway to fun on the bay, offering personal watercraft, pontoon, stand-up paddleboard, kayak and bike rentals. They also offer fun \"banana boat\" rides on a tube.\n\nAnother option is Cruisin' Tikis, a six-person tiki bar boat that goes out on the bay for a unique BYOB experience on the water.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen the beach is a washout, The Starboard's digital billboard out front always has the same message: \"When it rains, we pour!\" The bar fills with wet party-seekers and can be a rowdy scene, even in the morning hours.\n\nJust south of Dewey, you'll find the Indian River Lifesaving Station, which dates back to 1876 when it was built to save shipwreck victims near the coast. It has been restored to its 1905 appearance and is an interesting visit on a rainy day for history buffs.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, there is only one event that matters: Running of the Bull.\n\nHeld each July, the straight-up goofy event at The Starboard features two people in a bull costume crossing the highway (with a police escort) followed by hundreds of the bar's patrons. They then all run along the beach and return to the bar parking lot where a celebrity matador squares off with the bull, capping one of the weirdest (and most fun) events the state has to offer. Started by a handful of Starboard regulars in 1997, it now draws thousands dressed in red and white just like in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nOne of the best parties in Dewey each year happens after the summertime visitors leave. The Dewey Business Partnership hosts an all-ages end-of-season party in mid-September on the beach from New Orleans Street to Dagsworthy Street, complete with a band on stage and alcohol and food in hands. It usually costs $5.\n\nLewes\n\nIf you're looking for more of that New England seaport town feel, Lewes is for you.\n\nUnlike some other beach towns in the state, Lewes has a large year-round population, giving it more of a hometown vibe than a tourist trap.\n\nWith the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal cutting through town and a beautiful Lewes Canalfront Park to watch the boats go by, it's about as scenic as it gets.\n\nThrow in historic houses, a slower pace than Rehoboth and Dewey, and its fair share of fine restaurants and you realize why it's one of Delaware's best towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nIts charming, historic blocks boast quaint homes, Dutch architecture and blooming tulips everywhere in the spring. And if you want to visit the Jersey Shore, the Cape May-Lewes Ferry terminal is right near the beach, ready to bring you and your car the 17 miles across Delaware Bay.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nAgave Mexican Restaurant is a true gem and a local favorite. So much so that the long wait there is a punchline because of the crowds. Started in 2007 with 30 seats, they now have two locations (the other is out on Coastal Highway near Rehoboth). Be sure to try the puffy fish tacos, margaritas and even a flight of guacamole. (There's one on Del. 1 as well.)\n\nFor fine dining, Heirloom is a must-visit. Delaware Online/The News Journal food writer Patricia Talorico once wrote it \"might be Delaware's best restaurant,\" wowed by the \"feminine, but not at all frilly, upscale restaurant\" with entrees ranging from pan-seared scallops to grilled flank steak.\n\nOther fun stops include The Station on Kings cafe and market for pastries, Touch of Italy for sandwiches, Mr. P's for wood-fired pizza and Raas for some of the best Indian food in the state.\n\nFamilies really like Crooked Hammock Brewery. It's not just for the fresh beer for parents, but the \"Backyard\" filled with family-friendly games like ping pong, ring toss and cornhole.\n\nFor breakfast, Kaisy’s Delights is a treasure with omelets, quiches and croque monsieur sandwiches. Try the signature Kaisy bowl for dessert. Also, Bountiful Bowls is good for an acai bowl and Nectar Cafe for great brunch and juices/mimosas. And if you can get to Coastal Highway, Surf Bagel has bagels that even New Yorkers will concede are delicious.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nWhile most bars and restaurants close by 10 p.m., it doesn't mean the night has to be over. Irish Eyes Pub & Restaurant stays open until 1 a.m.\n\nBefore it gets late, the Crooked Hammock and Big Oyster breweries offer fresh brews. Try Solar Power, a Belgian blonde from Big Oyster, which is like a Blue Moon beer on steroids.\n\nOne of the most scenic spots to grab a drink is Grain on the Rocks, located right at the ferry terminal near the beach. Striper Bites, a casual bistro, is also a favorite bar/restaurant for many who like a nightcap.\n\nHalf Full is the place to go if you want to grab a glass of wine or appetizer while waiting for tables at Agave or Striper Bites and Nassau Valley Vineyards is a 4-mile drive inland.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nCrooked Hammock and Irish Eyes often host local music acts, as does Stango Park with its Summer Concert Series on Tuesday nights. On Coastal Highway, blues can usually be found at Bethany Blues BBQ.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Grain began hosting large-scale concerts at its waterfront location, selling seats in socially distanced pods. Its Rocking the Docks concert series has lived on with ticketed shows under the stars with the Robert Randolph Band (June 21) and Dumpstaphunk (August 23) among the acts.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nLewes has a calm and shallow beach, which is great for children. Don't plan on seeing any surfing or boogie boarding.\n\nLewes beaches have a little loophole for dogs in the summer season. They're permitted, leashed, before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. Surf-fishing is similar: Only before 8 a.m. or after 6:30 p.m.\n\nBeach parking lot meters are in use May 1 to Sept. 30 and downtown meters through Oct. 14. Meters are in use in all areas from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nMeters are $2.50 per hour at the beaches and $1.50 per hour downtown. There is a three-hour maximum downtown. Quarters are accepted only at downtown meters (a change machine is located at Mary Vessels Park, behind Biblion on 2nd Street), while cash is only accepted at the beach parking lots. Credit cards are accepted for all metered parking through the ParkMobile app, with a 50-cent fee.\n\nThere is limited metered parking at the beach with many deciding to park at nearby Cape Henlopen State Park instead. Also, check out the new Lewes Line pilot program that can be picked up all over town.\n\nAnd be sure to walk up to the nearby Dairy Queen for a cone, like locals have done since it came to town in 1954.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nIf you walk around Lewes, you'll find plenty out there.\n\nThe Lewes and Rehoboth Canal and Lewes Canalfront Park are the crown jewels, but also try Blockhouse Pond at George H.P. Smith Park for a peaceful getaway with a little bass fishing if you're up for it. (Fisherman also can be found at the wharf by the drawbridge.)\n\nThe Lewes Unleashed Dog Park is great for your four-legged friend or if you just want to see doggies out there playing. The Georgetown-Lewes Trail is worth a walk with a big chunk of it running through town. People who live along it go all out with landscaping and decorations.\n\nJust south of town is the 5,193-acre Cape Henlopen State Park filled with all sorts of outdoor fun, a beach and a nature center.\n\nGordons Pond is also a fun trail for a walk or run. You can connect from the beach via the bike loop or park at Herring Point or Gordons Pond and go from there.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nGo shopping inside at The Brush Factory Kings (unique home goods) or try a rum tasting at Beach Time Distilling.\n\nAs we mentioned in the Rehoboth Beach entry, Movies at Midway is great for rainy day films. Also try Lefty's Alley & Eats with bowling, laser tag, ax-throwing and an arcade all under one roof.\n\nShell We Bounce Trampoline Park is also open, giving your kids an opportunity to bounce around so much that they fall asleep early that night.\n\nBiblion Used Books and Rare Finds, as well as its sister store The Vintage Underground, are great for cozy escapes in Lewes. You can probably find something for anyone: the bookworm, the person who likes buttons with sassy sayings, the record lover and more.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nDuring the summer, you should try to be there for the Fourth of July holiday when the annual Doo-Dah Parade kicks off. Dating back to 1968, you can watch or join the fun-loving parade. Just be sure to be wearing red, white and blue because everyone else will be.\n\nThe same day also offers the Lewes Independence Day Boat Parade with decorated boats making their way along the canal as spectators watch from the canal banks.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe historic Lewes Farmers Market is a must and probably the best in the state. And try the rotisserie chicken at Lloyd’s Market, a terrific family-owned market that has local produce and milk from Lewes Dairy.\n\nDelaware Seashore State Park: 5 things to do, admission, eats and more\n\nBethany Beach\n\nThis tidy coastal town greets visitors on Coastal Highway with its 24-foot Chief Little Owl landmark totem pole made by sculptor Peter Wolf Toth.\n\nWith its own half-mile Boardwalk — half the size of Rehoboth's — the \"Quiet Resort\" is a dainty throwback that draws an older crowd looking for a slower pace than other bustling beach towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nBethany has none of the buzz of Rehoboth or Dewey and that's by design.\n\nMany restaurants close by 10 p.m. even on weekends. Good luck finding a bar with a band. Bars — establishments that focus mostly on selling alcohol — are not allowed in town, and bands are mostly relegated to the town's Bandstand.\n\nFamilies and retirees dominate the area, which has a small number of shops downtown — and almost all are not chains, though Five Guys arrived several years back.\n\nThe Boardwalk isn't mobbed like Rehoboth or Ocean City and most businesses have built up out on Route 26, which has seen plenty of growth as more and more restaurateurs and retail shops have moved in.\n\nOverall, it's a sleepy getaway. Perhaps that's why actor (and New Castle native) Ryan Phillippe purchased a summer home here for seasonal escapes from Los Angeles.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nIf you're traveling from the Rehoboth/Dewey Beach area, there are a couple of restaurants on the way to Bethany that offer unbelievable views near the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nFirst is Big Chill Beach Club with its 360-degree views from an iconic circular bar high above the Atlantic Ocean, offering beers and bites in the sun. On the other side of the bridge in Delaware Seashore Park, you'll find a real hidden gem: the former Hammerheads Dockside, now a Big Fish Restaurant Group's Dockside Marina Bar + Grill. It had been a small eatery and bar complete with a sandy patio with palm trees and live music on a stage along the dock. Expect more of the same, but with the Big Fish stamp all over it.\n\nThe newest addition to the Bethany area is on Route 26 in the form of SoDel Concepts' Ocean View Brewing Co., which brews its own fresh beer and offers a unique menu with favorites like fried chicken and food challenges like The Naptime: a sandwich with doughnut buns, a fried lobster tail and fried egg. (Um, what?!?)\n\nSoDel also has a pair of seafood-themed menus that draw crowds at Matt's Fish Camp and Bluecoast, along with North East Seafood Kitchen in Ocean View, just outside of town.\n\nFans of Italian must stop at DiFebo's Restaurant and slurp on some of Big Bob's Sunday gravy or try their nearby DiFebo's Market, filled with local goodies, baked goods, paninis and homemade deli case items.\n\nA family-style local's pick on the highway is The Cottage Cafe, owned by a pair of college buddies since opening in 1993, serving down-home breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nIn downtown, the large-scale Mango's has stunning beach views, a happy hour that fills the bar and a menu that has everything from tacos and steak to burgers and seafood. A block away is Bethany Blues BBQ, which smokes its own meats for lovers of brisket and pulled pork. (A new, third location will open in downtown Rehoboth Beach this summer.)\n\nOther area restaurants worth your money: Sedona (American cuisine), 14 Global (tapas/small plates), Mickey's Family Crab House and Misaki (sushi).\n\nFor sweets, try Sandy Pony Donuts with their mouth-watering hot, made-to-order doughnuts. They got their start as a food truck on Chincoteague Island and expanded northward. Oh, and Rosenfeld's Big Fish in South Bethany offers cake slices as big as your head and hefty one-pound eclairs (along with Jewish deli standbys.)\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nMango's with its lively bar and beach views is the most fun you'll have in downtown.\n\nIf you drive just outside the town limits, you'll find Bethany Boathouse on the highway with a fun beachy atmosphere and a nighttime party vibe worth checking out.\n\nBethany Blues also has a large bar filled with bourbons and The Salted Rim Margarita Bar & Grille further out on Route 26 in Millville has margaritas away from the beach crowds.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe Bethany Bandstand has musical acts on Thursday evenings if you want the \"Pleasantville\" experience of a small-town event.\n\nMango's hosts bands Friday and Saturdays at 10 p.m. until they close at 11:30 p.m., and acoustic acts can be found at Bethany Blues BBQ on Saturdays for happy hour.\n\nBethany Boathouse takes advantage of being outside the town limits by offering the most entertainment around with nightly live music and a true bar experience for those looking for late-night excitement.\n\nAnd don't forget that the Freeman Arts Pavilion with national acts is only 9 miles away, and the Jolly Trolley will pick you up in town for select shows so you can leave your car behind.\n\nWant to head inland? Shipwrecked Mini Golf & Ice Cream is about 2 miles west off Route 26. Also, check out the Millville Boardwalk for mini-golf, ice cream and even a giant beach ball pit.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nThere are plenty of no-nos: no tents, canopies, tarps, cabanas, ball playing, kites or alcohol, and umbrellas can be up to only 3 feet wide. No dogs on the beach or boardwalk from May 15 to Sept. 30. Surf-fishing is allowed only when lifeguards are off-duty.\n\nAll perpendicular or angled parking is head-in only in Bethany Beach. It's pay- or permit-to-park May 15 through Sept. 15, between 10 a.m. and 4, 8 or 11 p.m., as indicated by signage. There is a two-hour limit on Garfield Parkway.\n\nMeter rates are $2.50 per hour, paid via ParkMobile or using credit cards or quarters at pay stations and meters. Change machines can be found throughout the beach and 100 blocks of Garfield Parkway, as well as at North Pennsylvania Avenue and Central Boulevard.\n\nParking in Bethany Beach is very limited. Metered parking can be found on Garfield Parkway, the beach blocks, Atlantic Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. Most other downtown parking areas are reserved for those with residential or business permits.\n\nThis map of Bethany Beach parking areas will help with any confusion. Probably.\n\nParking permits can be purchased at the Police Department (214 Garfield Parkway) at a rate of $25 per day, $75 for three days and $175 for seven days. Permits are valid in all pay-to-park areas except Garfield Parkway.\n\nAnd here's a quaint option: Trolleys continuously run from the Friday before Memorial Day through mid-September between 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and cost only a quarter. (Driver does not make change, so time to hunt for some coins!)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFresh Pond just north of town off the coast is part of Delaware Seashore State Park, an oasis with walking trails and the nearby James Farm Ecological Preserve.\n\nRight on Coastal Highway, you'll find the 6.8-acre Bethany Beach Central Park for a whole lot of manicured grass and pickup games.\n\nSeven miles out of town you'll find Holt's Landing State Park, a 203-acre bayside escape with a salt marsh, forest, hiking trails, crabbing, a boat launch and family fun nights with music.\n\nAnd if you're thinking about where you might want to stay next time you visit, look into the Indian River Cottage rentals north of Bethany Beach at Delaware Seashore State Park. They're perfect for a more quiet and secluded experience, so book early.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nFor kids — and the grown-up kids that come out in some of us on summer vacations — video games, Skee-Ball, air hockey and pinball can be found at the Shore Fun Family Fun Center just off the Boardwalk.\n\nDickens Parlour Theatre, located 5 miles west of town, hosts nightly magic performances during the summer, along with live music.\n\nWhen it rains, the town's independent bookstore fills (Bethany Beach Books) as does Bethany Beach Comics and Gaming, along with the dozen or so boutique shops that can be found along Route 26.\n\nIf Daddy or Mommy needs a drink, Salted Vines Vineyard & Winery is a 15-minute drive west for wine, live music and food trucks. (They say children are welcome but must be under the supervision of an adult at all times.)\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIf you stay until the end of Labor Day weekend, definitely attend the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral, which dates back to 1985. A jazz band will mourn the \"death\" of the summer with a march down the Boardwalk as others pretend to weep, dressed in black. Totally unique.\n\nAlso, the Fourth of July fireworks on Bethany Beach is about as red, white and blue as you can get, complete with live music at the Bandstand.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nTake a 20-minute drive south to theAssawoman Bay State Wildlife Area. Sure the name will make the kids giggle, but you'll find more than laughs there: bald eagles, herons, egrets, woodpeckers, deer, amphibians, reptiles and more.\n\nFenwick Island\n\nLet's get one thing straight right off the bat: Fenwick Island is not an island just like Coney Island is not an island.\n\nBut it is a tiny beach town that reports only about 350 people as residents. Unlike Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey and Bethany, it has a beach and that's about it except for a few restaurants (some of which are quite good) and shops.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nThere's no Boardwalk or large-scale amusements, but they don't need it since they border the massive, touristy Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nEven though Fenwick is quiet, it's not quite like Bethany since the excitement of Ocean City sometimes spills over.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nJames Beard-nominated chef Matt Kern purchased Fenwick farm-to-table restaurant One Coastal, giving the local favorite a shot in the arm with high-end entrees worth the money. (He had previously been at Heirloom in Lewes.)\n\nJust like in Bethany, the beach-based SoDel Concepts restaurant group runs a handful of spots that bring in the bodies during the summer, including seafood-heavy menus at Catch 54 (with sweet bay views) and Matt's Fish Camp and Mexican cuisine atPapa Grande's.\n\nOther dining rooms to drop into include Our Harvest (platter-style feasts available), Nantucket's (fine dining seafood) and Warren’s Station, which is family-friendly and does not serve drinks.\n\nAnd for your sweet tooth, a Fisher’s Popcorn with caramel popcorn of all flavors — a perfect gift to bring back for whoever is watching your dog.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nThe bayside Harpoon Hanna's off Route 54 is your best shot at a beachlike, fun bar experience, complete with a Tiki bar, nightly live music and a sports bar that's open until 1 a.m. It's also a scenic spot for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nViking Golf & Go-Karts is tucked away off Coastal Highway on Island Street with 18 holes of golf, go-karts and water park in one spot.\n\nAnd just like for your Bethany visits, it's a short drive to Freeman Arts Pavilion for ticketed concerts with national acts. (It's 5 miles east of town, and Jolly Trolley offers rides for select shows to and from Fenwick.)\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nParking requires paying a meter or purchasing a permit in Fenwick Island, between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. from May 15 to September 15.\n\nDogs aren't allowed on the beach May 1 through September 30. Surf fishing is permitted only when lifeguards are off-duty, unless they say otherwise.\n\nIf you go to Fenwick Island State Park, you should get there real early on weekends because the small lot fills up very quickly. (It's $5 for residents and $20 for non-residents.)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFenwick Island State Park has 3 miles of ocean beaches for swimming and surf fishing, along with access to Little Assawoman Bay with kayaking and stand-up paddleboards available.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nThe DiscoverSea Shipwreck Museum on Coastal Highway is a great escape — just like some of the tales you'll find inside with rotating exhibits that focus on maritime heritage with 10,000 artifacts to dig through.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nIt's easy to miss, but Jimmy's Kitchen on Coastal Highway is that greasy spoon breakfast spot that draws locals early, opening at 7 a.m. and closing 5½ hours later each day. Try the chipped beef or \"The Heavyroller,\" a five-egg omelet that may send you right back to bed.\n\nThe staff of Delaware Online/The News Journal contributed to this report. Have a story idea?

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

(16 June 2022) -- Today, Cirrus Aircraft delivered the first of twenty-five SR Series TRAC20 aircraft to United Aviate Academy. The TRAC20 is an advanced, high-performance aircraft that will be used for initial pilot training at the only ab-initio flight academy operated by one of the largest U.S.-based airlines. In February, the company announced a purchase agreement with United Aviate Academy to purchase twenty-five TRAC20 aircraft with the option to acquire fifty more as the program grows.\n\n“The TRAC20 is one of the most technologically advanced aircraft on the market and we are super excited to bring it to our academy and train our students to prepare them for United Airlines,” said Dana Donati, Chief Executive Officer of United Aviate Academy.\n\nUnited Aviate Academy’s TRAC20 fleet is equipped with an integrated avionics suite essential for situational awareness and hazard avoidance, such as Synthetic Vision, ChartView, Active Traffic and more. These advanced avionics will prepare United Aviate Academy students for their careers at regional and mainline airlines after graduation. Additionally, the hot weather package keeps students and instructors comfortable in the Goodyear, Arizona training environment. The hazard and traffic avoidance features provide extra safety in this dense flight training area.\n\nCirrus Aircraft offers an aircraft personalization program where customers work with the Cirrus Aircraft Xi Design team to create a custom aesthetic for their aircraft using their own inspiration and vision. United Aviate Academy collaborated with the Xi Design team to create a unique livery featuring aspects of both brands. All twenty-five aircraft will feature this thoughtful design featuring the blue and white United Aviate Academy logo on the tail, fuselage, and crew seats as well as a wear-resistant interior.\n\n“Cirrus Aircraft is proud to work with United Aviate Academy to provide the next generation of United Airlines pilots with a fleet of advanced training aircraft built with the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System. For over 30 years, Cirrus Aircraft has been at the forefront of numerous industry safety innovations and maintains a safety rating well above the industry average,” said Zean Nielsen, Chief Executive Officer of Cirrus Aircraft. “Together, we are introducing more people to aviation and providing new opportunities for underrepresented populations by removing barriers and supporting new programs like United Aviate Academy.”\n\nUnited Aviate Academy’s year-long training program at Phoenix Goodyear Airport sets up students for a career that reflects United’s high standard of professionalism and commitment to delivering a safe, caring, dependable and efficient travel experience. The Academy is part of United’s industry-leading pilot career development program, which offers aspiring and established pilots the most direct path to a United flight deck. Within the next decade, United aims to hire more than 10,000 pilots and train about 5,000 aspiring pilots to aviation through the Academy.\n\nTo learn more about the SR Series TRAC20, please visit cirrusaircraft.com/fleet.\n\nAbout Cirrus Aircraft\n\nCirrus Aircraft is the recognized global leader in personal aviation and the maker of the best-selling SR Series piston aircraft and the Vision Jet®, the world’s first single-engine Personal Jet™, and the recipient of the Robert J.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

Donors who choose to donate on a bus can email their vote to kaltman@medicblood.org.\n\n“We see an increase in demand and a decrease in donations through the summer months leaving our inventory unstable and traditionally at critical levels,” said director of communications Kristy Altman. “This collaboration is a great way to give back to our fellow nonprofit partners while stocking the shelves.”\n\n“Our organization is excited for this partnership and the opportunity to support local nonprofits and our community this summer,” says United Way of Greater Knoxville President & CEO Matt Ryerson. “Donating blood is one of the easiest ways for our neighbors to give back, and now they can support their favorite nonprofit while doing it.”\n\nMEDIC is the primary blood product provider for major area hospitals including Blount Memorial Hospital, Covenant Healthcare System, East Tennessee Children’s Hospital, Tennova, and the University of Tennessee Medical Center along with other regional centers.\n\nAs a reminder, the blood on the shelves right now is the blood used in an emergency.

(Tuesday, June 7, 2022) — Summer must be on the way! School is out, temperatures are quickly climbing, and a popular promotion has returned to Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country. During Sevier County Days, anyone who lives or works in Sevier County can visit their favorite hometown theme park or water park for just $5, while also helping their neighbors at the same time.\n\nSevier County Days takes place June 13-19 at Dollywood theme park and now-June 12 at Dollywood’s Splash Country water park. Residents and workers in the county can visit the award-winning parks for a $5 donation to Sevier County Food Ministries. All proceeds from the visits go to the food ministries, helping the non-profit provide support within the community.\n\n“We are always proud to partner with Jim Davis and his phenomenal staff at Sevier County Food Ministries,” said Carol Agee, Dollywood Community Affairs and Philanthropy Manager. “As kids are now out of school for summer, demand for the food ministries increases because those school lunches aren’t available for families who need them. We encourage families in that situation to visit the food ministry because the team there does an exemplary job of assisting those in the community who need it. We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth. Those who work in Sevier County but are not residents must present proof of employment as well as a state- or federally-issued photo identification matching the paycheck stub. Full details and eligible zip codes also are available by visiting Dollywood.com/SevierCountyDays.\n\nAs an added bonus for making the donation to the food ministries, the Sevier County Days ticket receives full upgrade value toward the purchase of a 2022 season pass.\n\nDollywood first started giving to Sevier County Food Ministries in 1998. Since that time, total contributions to the food ministry are more than $1.4 million. In addition to monetary support, Sevier County Food Ministries always accepts passionate volunteers ready to serve others through their efforts. For more information about how to volunteer, please visit seviercountyfoodministries.org.\n\nDollywood celebrates a year full of exceptional experiences, with each season unlike the next. It’s the perfect year for a season pass, as guests will want to return throughout the year to enjoy it all. Up next, guests can enjoy Dollywood’s Smoky Mountain Summer Celebration (June 18-August 7), which includes the return of Sweet Summer Nights—the evening fireworks and drone show—as well as Gazillion Bubble Show Aurora.

YWCA’s Phyllis Wheatley Center serves hundreds of middle and high school youth through innovative, life-changing after-school and summer programs.\n\n“The students we serve are among Knoxville’s most vulnerable and are oftentimes low-income and at high risk for dropping out of school,” said Rachel Haverkamp, CEO of YWCA Knoxville & the Tennessee Valley. “Access to the internet creates opportunities for educational success and a chance to improve our neighborhoods and communities. Our organization will use the hotspots to support on-site programming, create opportunities for off-site learning and exploration and support students’ independent and group work at home.”\n\nHotspots are stand-alone Wi-Fi networks that can connect several devices at once wirelessly and have proven to be a vital tool for youth to access the internet, study and complete homework.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

The benefit replacement is automatic and does not require action from the FNS participant. This impacts more than 200,000 people in North Carolina and more than $24 million in replacement benefits.“We’ve worked quickly with the federal government to have $24 million in SNAP benefits restored to 200,000 individuals’ EBT cards, in light of the fact that due to power outages and worse, many families have lost their food,” said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Kody H. Kinsley. “We will creatively use every tool we have to support folks impacted by Hurricane Helene now and for the long-haul.”The approval is for FNS recipients in the following counties: Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Cleveland, Gaston, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey counties.

(Tuesday, June 22, 2021) — Dollywood officials announced an unparalleled benefit for hosts working at the Smoky Mountains theme park. Through a new partnership with WeeCare, the largest childcare network in the United States, hosts at all Dollywood Parks & Resorts properties can find licensed childcare providers who offer flexible schedules for newborns through school-aged children. Additionally, The Dollywood Company will pay a portion of childcare costs for those who enroll in the program.\n\nThis new benefit comes at an opportune time, as many parents are unable to return to their jobs following the pandemic due to a shortage of childcare workers. WeeCare concierge care managers are available to help enrolled hosts find and tour licensed, safety-certified family childcare homes. Once a family childcare home is selected, WeeCare assists in enrolling the hosts’ children and provides around-the-clock care support. The network of WeeCare facilities includes full-time, part-time, backup, drop-in, school-aged, after-school and overnight care options in the area.\n\n“Obviously, this is a tremendous benefit for our hosts,” said Tim Berry, Dollywood Vice President of Human Resources. “Simply put, childcare arrangements can be overwhelming to most families. It is our hope that this new partnership takes some of that stress away from our current and future hosts. The Dollywood Company has always been devoted to taking care of its employees and this is the next commitment to that. WeeCare can help hosts find childcare with hours that mirror Dollywood’s operating calendar, allowing our hosts more flexibility in scheduling. As any parent can attest, you can breathe a little easier when you know your kids are taken care of; there is an instant sense of relief. We want this to be the case for our hosts. Additionally, we will pay a portion of the costs for children at enrolled facilities, and all hosts are eligible. This benefit is not dependent on income.”\n\n“The WeeCare program adds to the new benefits we’ve provided to our hosts in recent weeks,” Berry added. “We just introduced a new loyalty bonus as a way to reward our employees for their dedication based on longevity and service to the company. Additionally, we offered pay premiums and free lunches for the month of June. Our hosts are what truly set Dollywood apart, and we want to reward them for what they do to make this a special place for our guests.”\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nWeeCare carries out its mission by providing an easy platform for parents to find affordable childcare including daycares, preschools, and nannies. Childcare deserts, areas where there are more than three children per childcare spot, are a harsh reality for many communities. WeeCare strives to reduce parental stress and ensure they are supported in the childcare process so they can show up to work ready to conquer the day.\n\n“WeeCare seeks to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of daycares, preschools, and overall childcare,” Jessica Chang, CEO of WeeCare, said. “Only 7% of companies provide childcare benefits to their employees, and even fewer provide subsidies, so Dollywood is showing its team how much they truly care.”\n\nAverage tuition for full-time, traditional daycare centers can be as high as $2,100 a month or more, pricing out many families. “Our average tuition for WeeCare ranges from $600 - $850 per month, which is much more affordable,” Chang said. “The reason for this is because we exclusively offer home daycares. WeeCare provides lower student to teacher ratios, are often conveniently located in neighborhoods, and offer flexible care schedules for employees who work weekends or holidays. Since we work with home daycare providers to fill their spots, their overhead is often lower, and those savings can be passed down to families to provide affordable, quality care.”\n\nDollywood launched its childcare benefits program on June 21. Upon joining WeeCare, Dollywood hosts will be able to find the perfect childcare conveniently close to their home or workplace. WeeCare partners with local childcare providers to help them grow their small businesses, supporting them with all business and marketing efforts.\n\nFor anyone looking to join Dollywood’s award-winning team, the company is hosting several hiring events at Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort & Spa in the coming weeks.

The park also earned the inaugural Golden Ticket Award for Best Guest Experience, which factors friendliness of employees into its criteria. The prestigious Golden Ticket Awards are given annually by industry publication Amusement Today. This recognition is the gold standard for theme parks worldwide.\n\nHosts at The Dollywood Company receive a variety of unique benefits including access to the Dollywood Family Healthcare Center, along with complimentary Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country admission for family and friends. Employees also take part in Dollywood’s Park Perks program which provides free or reduced admission to a large number of regional attractions, theaters and experiences. A comprehensive benefits package, including medical, dental and vision, is available for qualified full-time employees. Affordable lunch options are available for working hosts at several locations across the properties and are just $2.50 (free in June). Free soft drinks also are available to hosts at multiple locations.\n\nNumerous opportunities are available to help employees develop leadership skills, including a new apprenticeship program in conjunction with Walters State Community College.

The company launched online sales on May 1, 2021.\n\nThe difference in Green Llama is in its form. Instead of selling cleaners in a plastic bottle, the company provides all-purpose, glass, and bathroom cleaners in pod form. Simply drop the pod in a spray bottle and add water from the tap. The ingredients are biodegradable, non-toxic and naturally occurring or naturally derived. They are scented with essential oils for a touch of aromatherapy. It’s a truly eco-friendly cleaner that eliminates the need to purchase more throw-away plastic bottles.\n\nThe idea for Green Llama was born more than a year ago when Kay Baker, an occupational therapist, was cleaning her home. Baker was tired of buying new plastic bottles every time she ran out of cleaner; a light went on. After a lot of research, testing and many different recipes, she created the formulas for Green Llama.\n\n“I am passionate about the environment and reducing waste,” Baker said. “I love our products because they make it simple to cut out plastic in the home.”\n\nPlastic pollution is a worldwide problem with an estimated 46,000 pieces of floating plastic per square mile of our oceans. This wreaks havoc with an estimated 1 million sea bird and 100,00 marine mammal deaths annually directly from plastic. With increased awareness, individuals can make a big difference, starting in their homes.\n\n“We are trying to reduce the amount of single use plastic while also decreasing the energy cost of shipping water around the country,” Baker explained. “Each ready-made cleaner you buy from the store is more than 90% water. Since you already have water in your home, I removed it.”\n\nGreen Llama estimates if each household in the United States bought one single pod instead of a single-use plastic bottle, we would save 128 million plastic spray bottles from the landfill.\n\nGreen Llama currently sells kitchen, bathroom and all-purpose cleaning pods; sample packs are also available. The company also sells reusable glass bottles for those who have already recycled their plastic bottles.\n\nTo learn more or to purchase, visit greenllamaclean.com.\n\nDo It Yourself Storage in Dandridge sold\n\nDo It Yourself Storage at 822 US-70 Dandridge, TN sold June 17th for $4,300,000.

The project, previously referred to simply as Project 407, has been named “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” The first company that will locate in the development – a flagship Buc-ee’s Family Travel Center– was also disclosed.\n\nBased in Texas, Buc-ee’s is known for its pristine bathrooms, fresh BBQ, friendly service, and providing a unique travel stop unlike any other. With 38 stores in Texas, Buc-ee’s continues its expansion throughout the Southeast with newly opened stores in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and constructing stores in South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The Sevierville location will be the company’s first “Big Store” in the country; at over 74,000 square-feet , more than 120 fueling positions, EV Charging stations, and a car wash over 250 feet long.\n\nKituwah CEO Mark Hubble, who has helped other tribes nationally build tribal-owned businesses for the benefit of enrolled members, said, “Our goal is to be the first stop on everyone’s Smoky Mountain adventure – and Buc-ee’s is the perfect partner to ensure we give our customers a great beginning and ending to their family vacation. This is a business about excellence in customer experience with a huge fan following.”\n\nStan Beard, Director of Real Estate for Buc-ee’s, said, “It is not a coincidence that we chose The 407 as our first big store location outside of Texas. We will be the proverbial ‘welcome sign’ at the front door of the exceptional travel experience that the Smoky Mountains, Sevierville, and Sevier County has to offer. You won’t forget your first visit to Buc-ee’s and it won’t be your last! We are thrilled to share our over the top customer experience and be a pivotal part of the Kituwah and EBCI vision for the Gateway to Adventure.”\n\n“The goal of The 407: Gateway to Adventure is to create a comprehensive entertainment destination with best in class amenities.” Hubble explained. “Sevier County is a tourism economy, and it will take time to grow into a true entertainment hub. In the short-term, we are focused on offering breathtaking experiences people can enjoy on-property for a few hours or a few days.”\n\n“The City of Sevierville has long recognized the importance of development at I-40, and we are excited to see what Kituwah and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are planning,” said Sevierville Mayor Robbie Fox. “With the largest Buc-ee’s Family Travel Center ever built anchoring this development, we believe the future at The 407: Gateway to Adventure will be incredible.”\n\nChief Richard Sneed of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said, “The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is proud to partner with the elected officials and residents of TN on this exciting new opportunity and the vision behind it. Working together, we are uniquely poised to bring an experience not currently seen in Eastern Tennessee, providing an additional source for employment and tourism to the region.”\n\nAdditional concepts being explored and pursued for The 407: Gateway to Adventure include a world-class golf attraction, hotels, an ultimate sports experience, a state-of-the-art indoor go-kart facility, a distillery experience, and unique “retailtainment” attractions that are a combination of both themed attractions and stores.\n\nAccording to Matthew Cross, Founding Partner and CEO of OE Experiences whose company is working with Kituwah, LLC on the project, The 407: Gateway to Adventure has already drawn interest from developers and tenants around the world.\n\n“The 407: Gateway to Adventure is expected to draw 6.7 million visitors in its first full year of operation when Phase I is complete,” Cross said. “The space we have allows us to bring entirely new concepts to market and allows many existing local operators the chance to go big with some mind-blowing new ideas. This is the first of several exciting announcements we will be making in coming months.\n\n“We have been fortunate to have received considerable competitive interest. Our goal is to deliver memorable experiences for our guests that financially rewards Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and allow businesses within the development a compelling and creative environment to participate in and be part of. Quite simply, this project and this property are all about partnerships.”\n\nWhile later phases for the development remain flexible, the organizers say it will feature destination style placemaking that heightens the experience for visitors. Tourists and shoppers will have dining options, unique shopping experiences, and entertainment attractions that complement the overall vision.\n\nThe site’s location allows easy access from nearby Knoxville, something the developers are counting on to supplement daily visits and labor options. Chrissy Arch, Chair of the Kituwah Economic Development Board said, “We know Knoxville residents will visit this location for a unique date night, dining experience, shopping trip, or an easy weekend getaway. It is merely a 20-minute drive from Knoxville and a little over an hour from Asheville.\n\n“The tourism and overall economic impact of The 407: Gateway to Adventure will be significant for Sevierville, the entire Smoky Mountain Region, and the State of Tennessee.”\n\nThree Roots Capital receives $1.8M from U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide access to capital in economically distressed communities\n\nKNOXVILLE, TENN. (June 18, 2021) – This week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury awarded $1,826,265 in COVID-19 relief funds to Three Roots Capital (Three Roots) as part of its CDFI Rapid Response Program (CDFI RRP). Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Three Roots will use these funds to make loans and investments across East Tennessee and greater Central Appalachia, helping support job-creating small businesses, place-making commercial real estate projects and community facilities.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Treasury awarded $1.25 billion to 863 community development financial institutions (CDFIs) in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. These CDFI RRP grant funds will help recipients build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves, along with providing financial products, financial services, development services and other operational activities in their communities. Three Roots received the maximum award amount given and will use the capital to increase the size of the Three Roots Capital Impact Fund, which is a pool of capital from which it will make equity investments in addition to loans.\n\nThree Roots has a history of providing access to capital for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and projects in rural or low-income areas of East Tennessee and Kentucky. Since its founding in 2016, the CDFI has deployed over $74.5 million of capital, which has created or retained 1,564 jobs and developed 528,732 square feet of real estate. With Three Roots’ support and guidance, small businesses like Southeastern Packaging Technologies have thrived in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and rural, job-creating companies have continued to have positive impacts in their communities like Outdoor Venture Corporation in McCreary County, Kentucky.\n\n“I founded Three Roots in direct response to the chronic need for more investment capital in central and southern Appalachia and in the broader Southeast. This award allows us to continue to support small businesses and entrepreneurs in low-income and economically disadvantaged communities throughout the region,” said Three Roots Capital Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Grady Vanderhoofven. “CDFIs play an integral role in helping to lift economies, especially in times of need like this pandemic. We are honored to receive the maximum amount of this CDFI RRP award. Receiving these funds helps us continue to do what we do best: providing capital, connections, business coaching and collaboration in our region.”\n\nThree Roots anticipates the CDFI RRP funds could be used to help address an access to capital gap identified by Techstars in their Assessment of the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem of the Greater Knoxville Metropolitan Area. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the University of Tennessee recently announced the upcoming launch of a Techstars Industries of the Future Accelerator in Oak Ridge-Knoxville, which will foster the growth of 30 startups over three years.\n\nAbout Three Roots Capital\n\nThree Roots Capital (Three Roots) is certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and as a Community Development Entity (CDE). Because Three Roots is a CDFI, banks that make loans to, grants to, or investments in Three Roots may be eligible to receive Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit. Three Roots maintains its CDFI certification by making loans and/or investments to companies and projects located in low and moderate income (LMI) census tracts and by providing operational and technical assistance to companies and projects located in such areas. As a CDE, Three Roots is eligible to receive an allocation of federal New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs) and to participate in and facilitate NMTC transactions.\n\nMcNabb Center to cut ribbon on new Intensive Long-Term Support facility\n\n(KNOXVILLE, Tenn.)

(Tuesday, June 15, 2021) – Last summer, tens of thousands of children in our community missed the opportunity to participate in formal swimming lessons, creating an urgent need for water safety education in 2021. Drowning remains the leading cause of accidental death in children ages 1 - 4, and it’s the second leading cause of injury-related death of children 14 and younger.\n\nParticipation in swimming lessons can reduce the risk of drowning by up to 88 percent! Dollywood’s Splash Country is committed to helping bridge the gap to prevent drowning. This year, swim instructors and community leaders will come together Thursday, June 17 to provide a free 30-minute lesson in the morning and offer education throughout the day. Area partners LeConte Medical Center, The Dr. Robert F. Thomas Foundation, WVLT Local 8 News and WIVK 107.7 join Splash Country to host the event.\n\n“Dollywood’s Splash Country is committed to doing our part to educate and raise awareness about water safety,” explained Jason Boothe, Vice President of Park Operations. “In fact, we’re offering a $25 ticket and giveaways to incentivize people to join us for the swim lesson at 10 a.m. Research shows that swimming lessons save lives, so we’re inviting the community to join us as we host the World’s Largest Swimming Lesson.”\n\nThe World’s Largest Swimming Lesson (WLSL) is a one-day event that happens at pools and water parks around the world. Dollywood’s Splash Country is one of the participating venues, and to build out the event with a greater scope of water awareness, the Smokies’ most-trusted water park created Water Safety Day.\n\n“LeConte Medical Center is honored to be a part of raising community awareness around water safety,” said LeConte Medical Center President and CAO Gaye Jolly. “This event is extremely important to the safety of our community and goes a long way to ensure everyone can enjoy swimming and other water activities.

Mike Walker, a Sage Integration system engineer and nationally certified project manager, will lead the Knoxville office.\n\nWith a strong leadership team and financial backing, Sage Integration is developing a national footprint for serving enterprise organizations through organic growth and acquisitions of leading regional integrators. Nemerofsky said Sage Integration will continue opening new offices as necessary to meet growing demand.\n\nSage Integration was formed in 2019 by merging two regional security powerhouses, AYSCO Security Consultants and DTS Security.\n\nAbout SAGE Integration\n\nSAGE Integration is a leading national systems integrator protecting the people, facilities, and reputation of enterprise clients by advancing the intelligence and integration of security technology.

However, of Tennessee’s 95 counties, 18 have vaccination rates of 20% or below. Two grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture with funds awarded to University of Tennessee Extension hope to change that.\n\n“UT Extension has offices in all 95 counties across Tennessee, so we are in a unique position to be able to assist with vaccine education and combat misinformation,” states Lisa Washburn, UT Extension community health specialist and principal investigator for the grant. “In many communities across the state and the nation, Extension may be perceived as a more credible or highly trusted source than other government entities that do not have a local presence,” adds Washburn. “Our goal is to utilize local partnerships with the community to increase vaccine rates and continue to eliminate COVID-19 infection and transmission from communities across Tennessee.”\n\nThe first of the two projects will help family and consumer sciences agents in high-risk counties in Tennessee identify specific areas of concern among their constituents, such as misinformation about the vaccines, vaccine safety and how the vaccines were developed and produced. Counties that are considered high-risk are primarily rural, have low vaccination rates, and have higher scores on both the Pandemic Vulnerability Index and the Social Vulnerability Index, two tools used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The project will leverage social media outlets in order to target Tennesseans who are 18-50, as this age group represents those with the lowest vaccination rates. Messaging will aim to correct misperceptions, strengthen vaccine norms and provide information on where and how to access vaccines locally.\n\nThe second, more extensive project is led by Soghra Jarvandi, assistant professor with UT Extension, in partnership with the UT Health Science Center and the Tennessee Department of Health. Working with community advisory groups in counties with lower rates of vaccinations, grant investigators will hold listening sessions to uncover attitudes and concerns related to not only COVID-19 vaccines but other immunizations that prevent disease. Combining the community expertise of UT Extension with the vast clinical experience of both the UT Health Science Center and the Tennessee Department of Health will support the development of community-based educational events and products that address identified issues and questions related to vaccine hesitancy.\n\n“UT Extension,” asserts Jarvandi, “is proud to be one of 24 grantees across the nation participating in this important two-year project to advance the prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination.”\n\nThe projects are funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Cooperative Extension, and the CDC.\n\nThrough its mission of research, teaching and extension, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture touches lives and provides Real.

Broadway. No appointments required. Parents will have the opportunity to choose from several vaccinations at the clinic.\n\nAlthough immunizations are required for students entering preschool, kindergarten and seventh grade, officials say many rising seventh grade students fall behind.\n\n“This happens for several reasons, not the least of which is that kids tend to receive fewer annual checkups as they grow older,” said KCHD Nursing Director Dena Mashburn. “We wanted to offer this special clinic to help students get caught up on required and recommended vaccines and to offer the COVID-19 vaccine.”\n\nSeveral vaccines recommended for this age group will be available at the clinic, including tetanus - diphtheria -acellular pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine will also be available for students 12 years of age and older. As always, parents can discuss the options with KCHD team members and choose which vaccines their child receives at the clinic.\n\nIf families can’t attend the June 12 clinic, immunizations are available at area pediatrician offices and many local pharmacies. KCHD also provides vaccines at its main location, 140 Dameron Ave., and West Clinic, 1028 Old Cedar Bluff, by appointment. To make an appointment, call 865-215-5070.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and numerous other national medical organizations say immunizations are vital in protecting children from potentially serious diseases. The CDC estimates vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2018 will prevent more than 26 million hospitalizations, 936,000 deaths and save nearly $1.9 trillion in total societal costs. More information and recommendations for parents can be found at Healthychildren.org.\n\nMore information about childhood immunizations, including contact information for KCHD and a list of the recommended vaccinations by grade level, is available at knoxcounty.org/health.\n\nAbout Knox County Health Department\n\nThe first health department in Tennessee to achieve national voluntary accreditation by the Public Health Accreditation Board, the Knox County Health Department (KCHD) is dedicated to ensuring the conditions in which every resident can be healthy.

(NASDAQ: UCBI) (United) and Aquesta Financial Holdings, Inc. (OTC Pink: AQFH) (Aquesta) announced today a definitive agreement for United to acquire Aquesta, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aquesta Bank.\n\nAquesta is headquartered in Cornelius, North Carolina, a northern and fast-growing suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina situated on Lake Norman. It has a premier franchise with an experienced management team led by President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Engel, who founded Aquesta Bank in 2006. The bank’s high-touch customer service is delivered to retail and business customers through a network of nine branches located in Charlotte’s most attractive markets and also in the coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina.

Additionally, $586 million, or 92%, of its deposit base consists of non-CD core deposits.\n\n“This transaction is consistent with our desire to expand into attractive and fast-growing markets that we know well,” said Lynn Harton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United. “We have been investing in Charlotte over the past several years and have commercial banking and mortgage teams already in place. Aquesta is an exciting opportunity for us to increase our presence and accelerate our growth with a high-quality company that shares our values of customer service, employee engagement and community development.”\n\nJim Engel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aquesta, stated, “From the beginning, we have focused on developing a business model with a focus on relationship banking in Charlotte and other key markets in the Carolinas, which are some of the most attractive and fastest growing markets in the Southeast and the country. We believe that we have been successful at that. However, to continue growing and becoming more profitable, we needed a partner who can provide us the opportunity to better serve our customers with a larger balance sheet and expanded products and services to offer. Our partnership with the United team provides just that, and I believe the synergies that exist between our companies will result in tremendous success for both sides.”\n\nThe transaction value is estimated at approximately $131 million, including approximately $12 million in value for outstanding options and warrants to acquire Aquesta common stock. The transaction structure includes an election for Aquesta stockholders to receive their consideration in cash, subject to a limitation that no more than 30% of the total consideration paid by United will be in cash.

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/07/01/sarasota-county-centennial-is-july-1-most-important-events-from-1921-2021/7745608002/", "title": "100 most important events in Sarasota County history from 1921-2021", "text": "This summer marks the 100th anniversary of Sarasota County.

It's about 213 miles from metro Phoenix, a shorter distance than San Diego or Los Angeles.\n\nA trip to Puerto Peñasco is easy to plan. But unlike a Southern California beach trip, you'll have to factor in border crossings on the way. Travelers must have proper documentation to legally cross the border, and are advised to follow safety precautions.\n\nLodging options for Rocky Point travelers include Encantame Towers, a condominium resort that continues to expand, as well as resorts along Sandy Beach, Playa Hermosa and Playa Bonita. If you'd rather fly than drive, here's why airlines are adding more flights to Mexico (and Canada) from Phoenix.\n\nHere's how to plan your Puerto Peñasco summer vacation.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nIs it safe to travel to Puerto Penasco right now?\n\nThe state of Sonora, Mexico, which includes Puerto Peñasco, remains under a Level 3 advisory from the U.S. Department of State, which means reconsider travel. This is because of violent crime and kidnapping in the state.\n\nPuerto Peñasco has a reputation as a safe destination. However, people must still use caution on their visits.\n\nFor instance, the State Department advises people not to use taxi services, public buses or rideshare applications in Rocky Point because of a lack of secure dispatching procedures and the potential danger of kidnapping and violent crime.\n\nDo you need a passport to go to Rocky Point?\n\nYes. A passport is required to cross any international border.\n\nYou can use a passport book or a passport card to enter Puerto Peñasco by car and return to the U.S. Here's the difference between a passport book and a passport card:\n\nPassport books are good for all forms of international transportation. They cost $130 plus a $35 application fee.\n\nare good for all forms of international transportation. They cost $130 plus a $35 application fee. Passport cards are cheaper — $30 plus a $35 application fee. But they are only valid for land and sea entry to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and Caribbean countries. They are not valid for international air travel.\n\nDo kids need passports to go to Mexico?\n\nAll children, regardless of age, must have a passport to travel internationally. Passports for adults are valid for 10 years; passports for children 15 and younger are valid for five years.\n\nTo find out how to apply for passports for minors, go to travel.state.gov.\n\nCan US citizens drive to Puerto Penasco?\n\nYes. Driving is the most common way tourists get to Puerto Peñasco, according to the city's convention and visitors bureau.\n\nThe State Department says drivers should only use Federal Highway 8 via the Lukeville Port of Entry to travel to Puerto Peñasco and to only drive during daylight hours. Highway 8 was designated a \"safety corridor\" by Arizona and Sonora officials in 2016 and has bilingual signs, security cameras and locations where drivers can seek roadside assistance.\n\nThe Lukeville-Sonoyta crossing is open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. To get there from central Phoenix, head west on Interstate 10 and take Exit 112 for State Route 85 south. Continue through Gila Bend, Ajo and Why to get to the Lukeville crossing. You can check border wait times at bwt.cbp.gov.\n\nPosted speed limits along Highway 8 to Puerto Peñasco range from 40 to 90 kilometers per hour, or 25 to 55 mph. Observe all traffic laws. Enforcement is intense.\n\nDrive especially carefully and mind your speed in Sonoyta, just inside the Mexican border. Watch for stop signs (alto in Spanish) and expect to encounter people who want to wash your windshield or ask for donations that are said to bless your trip. Just slow down and wave if you don't want to contribute.\n\nDo you need Mexican car insurance for Rocky Point?\n\nYes. You must buy Mexican car insurance for your Rocky Point trip, as U.S. auto insurance policies won't cover driving in Mexico.\n\nMany insurers, including Mexpro, AAA, Geico and Progressive, offer Mexican car insurance that you can buy online in advance. Prices are based on the value of your car, your travel dates and the type and amount of coverage.\n\nYou also can buy a Mexican car insurance policy in towns along the way to the Lukeville Port of Entry, including Gila Bend and Ajo.\n\nWhat is the difference between Rocky Point and Puerto Peñasco?\n\nRocky Point and Puerto Peñasco refer to the same place in Mexico.\n\nRocky Point is a common English translation of Puerto Peñasco, with \"puerto\" roughly translating to port and \"peñasco\" meaning boulder, crag or pointed rock in English, according to Google Translate and SpanishDict.com.\n\nWhere is Puerto Peñasco?\n\nPuerto Peñasco is a fishing village in Sonora, Mexico, on the northern tip of the Sea of Cortez.\n\nHow far is Rocky Point from Phoenix?\n\nIt's about 213 miles southwest of the Phoenix city center and 63 miles of the Lukeville Port of Entry on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIs it worth going to Puerto Peñasco?\n\nFor many Arizonans, Puerto Peñasco is a worthwhile destination because it's closest beach to Phoenix and it's less expensive than Southern California.\n\nTravelers and travel agents cite the weather, beaches and resorts as reasons why Rocky Point is worth visiting, as well as its reputation as a safe place compared to other parts of Mexico and its small-town feel in contrast with resort destinations like Cancun.\n\nWhat is Puerto Peñasco known for?\n\nThe top rated attractions in Puerto Peñasco according to Tripadvisor include:\n\nEl Pinacate and Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve. Isla San Jorge. Cholla Bay. Cholla Mall. Playa Bonita Beach. Playa Encanto. Seashell Museum. Old Port. Mermaid's Market. Tequila Factory.\n\nWhat is the best month to go to Puerto Peñasco?\n\nIt depends what you're looking for, as people visit throughout the year for different reasons.\n\nFor budget-conscious travelers looking for the lowest lodging rates, Tripadvisor users suggest visiting between December and February.\n\nSpring and fall tend to be best for people seeking lighter crowds and the most pleasant weather. While summer is a popular time for tourism, weather can be similar to Phoenix with heat and monsoon storms.\n\nWhat is the weather like in Puerto Peñasco in the summer?\n\nVisitors can expect the hottest temperatures in the summer, peaking around 104 degrees in July, according to data from Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, Mexico's weather service. (Temperatures are given in Celsius in Mexico's data; Puerto Penasco's maximum July temperatures are around 40 degrees Celsius, which equates to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\nCan you swim in the ocean in Puerto Penasco?\n\nYes. The beaches at Rocky Point are popular for swimming, snorkeling, jet skiing and other activities.

It was the 8th-deadliest hurricane in continental U.S. history.\n\nThe unnamed Category 5 storm struck with sustained winds over 185 mph. The intensity was based on the minimum central pressure reading of 892.3 millibars, which was a record for a U.S. landfall hurricane.\n\nMore than 250 of the victims were veterans working in the Keys on infrastructure projects to tie the long string of islands to the mainland. A rescue train sent to evacuate work camps in the Upper Keys was derailed by the storm and left sprawling on its side.\n\nThe storm even took two swipes at the Sunshine State, coming back to make a second landfall near Cedar Key, Florida, as a Category 2 hurricane two days later.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2004, Hurricane Frances, packing winds up to 105 mph, went ashore at the southern end of Hutchinson Island, near Port St. Lucie, dumping heavy rain across the state. The storm, blamed for 49 U.S. deaths, then pushed offshore into the northeast Gulf of Mexico before making a second U.S. landfall, at the Florida Panhandle.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 1979, Hurricane David, which killed some 2,000 people in the Dominican Republic as a Category 5 storm, moved up the Florida coast as a Category 2 storm. It struck West Palm Beach then skirted the coastline before making landfall in Georgia.\n\nThe storm caused several million dollars in damage to the Palm Beach County area and more than $50 million in damage throughout the state, according to the Sun-Sentinel.\n\nThe most recent Labor Day intruder was Hurricane Hermine, which hit Florida’s Big Bend in 2016 as a Category 1.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2017/05/16/big-chill-beach-club-nearing-memorial-day-opening/325208001/", "title": "Big Chill Beach Club nearing Memorial Day opening", "text": "Josh Grapski was forced, at times, to raise his voice to speak at a sound level higher than the buzzing and humming of construction all around him.\n\nThe La Vida Hospitality Group managing partner was standing on one of the many decks at the soon-to-be-opened Big Chill Beach Club, talking about the many features the club will bring to the Delaware Seashore State Park.\n\nThe long-awaited new venue, one of the biggest new attractions on Delmarva in 2017, is getting closer to opening, with Friday, May 26 as target date to kick off Memorial Day Weekend. If not that date, then \"really close\" to then, Grapski said.\n\nAt a Tuesday morning press conference, DNREC's Delaware State Parks announced the official grand opening of the new full-service restaurant and bar built atop the park's existing bathhouse next to the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nSpeakers at the press conference included Gov. John Carney, DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin, Delaware Tourism Office Director Linda Parkowski, Parks and Recreation Director Ray Bivens and Grapski.\n\nThe partnership between state parks and La Vida Hospitality — owners of other beach favorites Fork & Flask at Nage Restaurant, Crooked Hammock, Big Chill Surf Cantina and more — is the largest public/private partnership and capital investment (more than $1 million) in state parks history, according to Carney and Garvin.\n\n“The state parks really thrive on partnership, leveraging resources, leveraging challenges and turning them into positives for the people of Delaware,\" Garvin said.\n\n“This is a really important industry in our state, the $3 billion tourism industry,\" Carney said. \"It drives so much employment and so much fun and so many visitors come here to this place, and we’re enhancing it with this public-private partnership.”\n\nThe partnership is an obvious one for Grapski and the rest of La Vida Hospitality to take part in.\n\n“To kind of define that word partnership, we view this as us working with the state parks to enhance an experience that’s already great here at the Seashore State Park,\" Grapski said. \"We know tons of people are coming here. We hope to be an additional amenity to the park that people can enjoy in a different way.”\n\nIt will be a much different way than park-goers are used to. The construction site is an easy indicator of that. Work began on-site on Feb. 1 by Lighthouse Construction of Dover.\n\nBig Chill is a sprawling space with 360-degree views of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian River Inlet and Indian River Bay. There will be seating for up to 200 guests to enjoy dining and cocktail service.\n\nOther features include a $300,000 adjustable umbrella \"room\" for rooftop dining. There's a bar inside the umbrella'd area with 24 bar stools. The umbrella, manufactured in Austria, is 36-feet wide and is designed to protect against rain and wind up to 100 mph.\n\nRELATED: Three Delaware beach towns approved for emergency nourishment\n\nFood at Big Chill is designed to be typical beach fare, with classics like burgers, hot dogs and crinkle-cut fries. Of course, there will be seafood and an oyster bar. Grapski said La Vida is putting its own twist on it by adding SoCal tacos from Taco Reho, its food truck in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nGuests can take food to the beach but alcohol will not be able to hit the sand.\n\nBig Chill will employ \"northwards\" of 50 to begin the season, Grapski said, though he added that number may rise around July 4.\n\nREAD MORE: Bloody Mary competition returns to the Starboard on May 21\n\nAlso on the property is an event tent, which will play host to weddings and other events.\n\n“We’re currently working on a couple different partnerships with some of our local marketing friends to bring different events, beer festivals, culinary coast events,\" Grapski said of the tent area. \"Things like that will allow us to use this space and really show off this beautiful state park.”\n\nThe immediate area near the state park, Carney said, is a place he consistently recommends to colleagues in Washington.\n\n“I’ve always felt the top of the Indian River bridge has the best view in the whole state of Delaware,\" Carney said.\n\n“I wish I could stay here all day.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Delaware Tourism Office unveiled 50 new beach umbrellas available for rent at the Seashore State Park. The umbrellas are emblazoned with the Visit Delaware logo and have the new slogan, \"Endless Discoveries\" featured on them as well.\n\nThe umbrellas, Parkowski said, will be \"dotting the beaches for years to come.\"\n\njneiburg@delmarvanow.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/05/26/memorial-day-2023-when-is-memorial-day-weekend-how-to-spend-it/70256998007/", "title": "Memorial Day 2023: When is Memorial Day weekend and how to ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2024/08/03/hurricane-center-increases-chances-debby-will-form-near-florida/74649637007/", "title": "Tropical Storm Debby forms, expected to be hurricane in Big Bend", "text": "A slow-blooming tempest that stalked Florida this week became Tropical Storm Debby on Saturday afternoon and is expected to hit North Florida's Big Bend area as a Category 1 hurricane, weather forecasters said Saturday afternoon.\n\nA hurricane warning is now in effect for the state's Gulf Coast from the Suwannee to the Ochlockonee rivers, and a tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast west of the Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass, and the coast east of the Suwannee River to Yankeetown, the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 p.m. update.\n\nDebby's winds were up to 40 mph, and tropical-storm force winds extended out 140 miles from its center of circulation, the Hurricane Center said.\n\nUpgraded to Tropical Depression Four late Friday, and to Debby at 5 p.m. Friday, the swirl of firing thunderstorms was forecast to make landfall in the Big Bend region of the state early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva said Friday that if the system leans toward the left, or the western edge of the forecast track cone, it would have more time to fuel up on the incredibly warm waters of the Gulf.\n\n“It might be strengthening all the way up until it makes landfall, DaSilva said. “If it rides the western portion of the cone, there is nothing to slow the strengthening other than it hitting land.”\n\nA tropical storm warning went into effect at 2 p.m. for the Florida Keys from the Seven Mile Bridge westward and north of the Seven Mile Bridge to the Channel 5 Bridge. The storm warning includes the Dry Tortugas and the west coast of the Florida peninsula from south of Yankeetown to East Cape Sable.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., the storm was 100 miles southwest of Key West and starting to move into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. It's forecasted to move north over the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Saturday and into Sunday, reaching the Florida Gulf coast late Sunday or Monday.\n\nThe hurricane forecast cone of uncertainty has shifted some since Friday, with the landfall area stretching anywhere from Indian Pass southeast of Panama City to Yankeetown. Inland areas including Tallahassee, Gainesville, Jacksonville and Daytona Beach were also in the cone as the system passes through the state and into Georgia as a tropical storm. It is forecast to reach the Atlantic Ocean late Tuesday into early Wednesday.\n\nMuch of the Gulf Coast and parts of coastal southeast Florida can expect rain totals of 6 to 10 inches this weekend through Thursday morning. This could cause local flash and urban flooding, including isolated river flooding. Isolated areas near Tampa could get as much as a foot of rain.\n\nHurricane Center forecasters have been cautious to note the uncertainty of Gulf Coast-skimming storms.\n\n\"Since the forecast track is almost parallel to the west coast of the Florida Peninsula and the southeast coast of the U.S., only a small change in the track could lead to large changes in which land areas receive any landfalls and the biggest impacts,\" NHC forecasters wrote in a Friday discussion.\n\nStorm surge is also a concern along the shallow Gulf Coast with up to 5 feet possible along the immediate coast from Bonita Beach to Indian Pass. A 1- to 3-foot storm surge is possible along the very southern tip of the peninsula from Card Sound Bridge to Bonita Beach.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Thursday for 54 counties. Seven more counties were added late Friday, putting 61 of Florida's 67 counties under a state of emergency.\n\nTropical storm-force winds could reach the southwest coast of the state during the day Sunday, with areas in the Big Bend region beginning to feel the brunt of the system's winds late Sunday. National Weather Service meteorologists in Tampa said residents should be prepared Sunday for gusty winds of 30 to 50 mph, some coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes.\n\nRobert Molleda, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Miami, emphasized that impacts could be felt far afield of the cone.\n\n“(Saturday) is not going to be a good day. It’s going to rain a good part of the day,” Molleda said. “The other main concern is the potential for flooding.”\n\nForecasters have maintained 2024 will be a busy hurricane season, despite the mostly quiet month of July. The combination of an emerging La Niña climate pattern and exceptionally warm water temperatures led NOAA to issue its highest storm forecast on record in late May with a prediction of 17 to 25 named storms, including eight to 13 hurricanes.\n\nColorado State University increased its number of named storms for the season to 25 from the 23 it forecast June 1. It increased the number of hurricanes to 12 from its original forecast of 11.\n\nAn average hurricane season has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nWhile there were concerns earlier in the week that the storm would stall or meander in a collapse of steering winds, the thought Friday was it would get picked up by a trough moving over the Ohio Valley that would take it across the state and into the Atlantic.\n\nAfter brutal storm landfalls in 2022 by Category 4 Ian and 2023 by Category 3 Idalia, people on the Gulf Coast may be fearing a major hurricane or the potential for rapid intensification. Rapid intensification is when a storm gains 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period.\n\nThat seems unlikely, said Jeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground and a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. Not only is the system getting a slow start after raking across the mountainous spine of Cuba, it’s not expected to be over water long enough to rapidly intensify.\n\nIf the storm was expected to linger over water, there would be more concern.\n\n\"The eastern Gulf of Mexico is one of the last places we want to see a developing storm system in the coming days,\" said Michael Lowry, a meteorologist with South Florida ABC affiliate Channel 10, in a daily briefing. \"Water temperatures are not only the warmest on record for the time of year in this area but are some of the warmest waters anywhere on the planet right now.\"\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

In Pennsylvania, they're up to $3.\n\nAAA also reminded people to get their cars serviced before heading out.\n\nIt's a tired refrain from the automotive and travel insurance company, but last year AAA had to rescue more than 55,000 stranded Mid-Atlantic motorists over the holiday weekend thanks to battery, tire and other issues.\n\nWatch out for these closures\n\nOn Sunday and Monday, there will be road closures tied to Memorial Day celebrations in Georgetown and Dewey.\n\nGeorgetown: The Circle in Georgetown will be closed to traffic from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Sunday to honor veterans for Memorial Day.\n\nDewey: For the safety of runners/walkers in the 17th Highway One Companies 5k, the right lane will be closed on Del. 1 south in Dewey from Dickinson Street to New Road from 7:15 a.m. until 8 a.m. on Monday.\n\nConsider taking the bus\n\nDon't want to drive in traffic?

A court will decide", "text": "Ocean City, Md. — Legal experts assert the right to travel is a fundamental liberty in the United States.\n\nYet, beach towns and whole states are instituting restrictions on travel in an effort to protect their communities from COVID-19.\n\nThe two ideas have reached a crossroads, and a lawsuit between property owners and a North Carolina county could set a new precedent for how communities prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn March 20, Dare County, North Carolina, one of four counties that make up North Carolina’s Outer Banks, introduced a new restriction stopping non-residents from entering the county.\n\nTo enter Dare County after 10 p.m. on March 20, drivers had to present identification at checkpoints showing they were permanent residents of the county.\n\nThe goal was to protect the region's fragile medical resources, but property owners want to be let in and have filed suit in federal court against Dare County.\n\nThe restriction is unconstitutional, said Chuck Kitchen, an attorney representing the out-of-state property owners.\n\n“We are alleging it’s a violation of what’s called the Privileges and Immunity’s Clause and what it does is say a citizen of each state has the same rights as the citizens of what’s called the several states, or in other words all other states,” Kitchen said.\n\nThe right to travel among jurisdictions has been considered a \"core constitutional right\" in the past by the U.S. Supreme Court, said Michael Pappas, a law professor at the University of Maryland's Francis King Carey School of Law. The Supreme Court has also recognized that governments have certain powers in times of emergency.\n\nThe Dare County lawsuit points out another constitutional right that says states can't discriminate against citizens of another state, said Rick Su, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.\n\nIn this situation, Dare County is allegedly discriminating against residents of South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland.\n\nThe healthcare infrastructure in many beach resorts isn't capable of handling a large number of patients because the year-round population is so low.\n\nRehoboth Beach is located in Sussex County, Delaware and has a year-round population of about 1,200.\n\nMayor Paul Kuhns said approximately 20% of the homes in the city are inhabited by year-round residents, with the other 80% being used as second homes or rental properties.\n\nThat's why Rehoboth Beach is enforcing travel restrictions, to protect the people who live at the beach year round.\n\n“This is a very small area population-wise so what the real fear is our healthcare infrastructure isn’t made to handle a substantial amount of people like probably the areas where many of our second homeowners are coming from,” Kuhns said.\n\nWhat's going on in Dare County?\n\nIn a video message to the community Dare County manager Bobby Outten said the goal was to protect year-round residents.\n\n“The intent of this declaration is to decrease the risk of exposure and limit the spread of the COVID-19 in Dare County by eliminating non-essential travel, thereby reducing the number of individuals in the county and ultimately reducing the potential virus spread and the consequences of COVID,” Outten said.\n\nMuch of the Outer Banks, including Dare County, falls into the Norfolk Hospital Referral Region that has approximately 2,543 hospital beds, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\nThe Norfolk Hospital Referral Region also covers parts of southeastern Virginia, including metro areas such as Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads.\n\nAll told, the 2,543 hospital beds and 276 ICU beds are meant to serve an adult population of more than one million in two different states, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\nWhen the county's restriction was enacted on March 20, Sheila Davies, director of Dare County Health & Human Services, said there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Dare County, and only 137 total cases across North Carolina.\n\nSince then Dare County has 11 confirmed cases of COVID-19, one death and the state of North Carolina has a total of 5,465 overall, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nKitchen, an attorney out of Raleigh, North Carolina, maintains that his clients constitutional rights are being taken away by Dare County's restriction.\n\n“If you’re a citizen of Virginia, Maryland or South Carolina, you have the same rights as people from North Carolina, or in this case the four counties in North Carolina,” Kitchen said.\n\nThe plaintiffs, six in total, own multiple properties in Dare County, Kitchen said. Three own second homes and three others use their properties as rentals.\n\nHe added, two of the plaintiffs own multiple properties in Dare County.\n\n“Our position is communities don’t have a right to prevent people who have second homes or rental properties from coming to those properties,” Kitchen said.\n\n'No bright line in the sand'\n\nWhen it comes to a jurisdiction's legal authority to restrict travel, especially in a time like now with COVID-19, there isn't a very clear standard of what's allowed.\n\n“The frustrating part is there's not a bright line in the sand,” Pappas said.\n\nAmericans have the right to travel, and jurisdictions have the right to regulate that, Pappas said.\n\n“If the government wants to regulate individuals from traveling among the states, they have to and this is the language the Supreme Court uses, ‘There has to be a compelling government interest,’ that is they have to have a really good reason and it has to be narrowly tailored,\" Pappas said.\n\nIn this case, the legal argument for the property owners may be Dare County could have passed a narrower restriction than just stopping all out-of-state residents from entering the county, Pappas said.\n\nA possible counterargument to that claim, Su said is that Dare County isn't discriminating against the people because they're from out-of-state, but rather because they could possibly be carriers of COVID-19 and may not be exhibiting any symptoms.\n\n“Is that a good proxy? Maybe not,” Su said. “Just because you’re from New York doesn’t mean you’re infected with coronavirus. On the other hand, in the context of an emergency like this, maybe that’s a reasonable assumption to make.”\n\nThe act alone of setting up checkpoints or stopping people from entering a jurisdiction by itself isn't necessarily a legal issue, Su said. Like many coastal regions, the Outer Banks are hit by hurricanes and in those times of emergency, county officials are known to restrict travel to certain areas.\n\nIn those cases, though, almost everyone is restricted, not just non-residents or out-of-state travelers, Su added.\n\nLike Pappas, Su said what the lawsuit will come down to is whether or not Dare County's rule is sufficiently tailored to address the issue at hand.\n\n“Either way it’s going to set a line, and it’s either going to embolden restrictions where governments won't have to go so far to narrowly constrain their laws … or governments will have to try hard to tailor their laws so it only hits the issue they’re trying to address,” Su said.\n\n'We walk a fine line'\n\nBeach towns across Delaware, Maryland and Virginia have used different strategies to turn away visitors and out-of-state residents. Many have closed hotels, rental properties, beaches and boardwalks to stop people from coming.\n\nOcean City, a resort town on Maryland's coast, has restricted who hotels and rental properties can rent to and closed its beach and boardwalk.\n\nWhile the year-round population of Ocean City hovers around 7,000, the town becomes one of Maryland's largest cities in the summer when more than 300,000 people flood in to enjoy its beach.\n\nEven though Ocean City serves a large summer population, Mayor Rick Meehan said the area's medical resources aren't like the ones you'll find in Baltimore or Washington D.C.\n\n\"We do not have the hospital resources right here in Worcester County to provide medical services to populations from outside of this area if in fact this pandemic grows,\" Meehan said.\n\nSimilar to Dare County, resort communities in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia all have a limited number of hospital beds.\n\nThe three beach resorts fall into the Salisbury Hospital Referral Region, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. In total, the region has about 598 hospital beds, 59 ICU beds and serves approximately 371,513 adults across parts of three states.\n\nIn Chincoteague, a small resort community of about 2,899 residents on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, Mayor J. Arthur Leonard closed hotels, campgrounds, rental properties and other attractions to try to stop people from visiting.\n\nRight now Chincoteague has a checkpoint set up to access the island and identification isn't required yet, Leonard said. That could change if the situation on the Eastern Shore of Virginia worsens.\n\n“We walk a fine line. We did not tell anyone not to come, but what we did was take their ability to stay,” Leonard said. “If there’s nowhere for them to overnight on the island, it makes it less attractive for them to travel here.”\n\nBeach communities in coastal Delaware are taking similar steps to restrict out-of-state travelers. The city of Rehoboth Beach has also closed its beach and boardwalk in an effort to try and get some visitors not to come, Kuhns said.\n\n“Our feeling is people have the right to participate in the use of their own homes whether they're a secondary or primary home, and it has not gotten to the point where we see it fit to put heavy-handed restrictions in place,” Kuhns said.\n\nBecause of that the town hasn't stopped out-of-state visitors or travelers from coming to Rehoboth Beach, Kuhns said. What the city has done is make sure any out-of-state traveler that comes into Rehoboth Beach abides by the state's mandatory 14-day self-quarantine.\n\nIn total between April 3-13, Rehoboth Beach has arrested eight individuals for not complying with the city's beach and boardwalk closure, according to the town.\n\n“The healthcare infrastructure is somewhat limited here, and it can handle the people that live in the area, but it becomes very heavily taxed if it’s very crowded and that’s the big fear,” Kuhns said.\n\nMatthew Prensky is the Ocean City News Reporter for Delmarva Now.

Because of the way the solar particles interact with Earth's magnetosphere, the powerful eruption should make the vibrant northern lights visible to a wider swath of the Northern Hemisphere than usual.\n\nHere's what to know about the northern lights and how to see them on Thanksgiving night in the United States.\n\nNOAA issues Thanksgiving week geomagnetic storm watch\n\nNOAA has been tracking a coronal mass ejection since Sunday that exploded from the sun on a trajectory that should reach Earth later this week.\n\nForecasters use a five-level scale to measure geometric storms, which are caused when coronal mass ejections release solar particles and electromagnetic radiation toward our planet. The solar storm is relatively small; NOAA measured it at a minor G1 intensity Thursday and a moderate G2 intensity on Friday.\n\nThe forecast storm won't quite have the oomph of the G4-level whopper that came along Oct. 10, but it should still unveil the auroras across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nWhere will the auroras be visible?\n\nThe auroras are best seen around the magnetic poles of the Northern and Southern hemispheres in Europe, Asia and North America. In the U.S., Alaska is well known to have the best viewing opportunities for the northern lights.\n\nBut Thursday's incoming solar storm should make the auroras visible farther from the poles. The geomagnetic activity has a Kp index of 5, meaning the northern lights will also be brighter, according to NOAA.\n\n\"If you are in the right place, these aurora can be quite pleasing to look at,\" the agency says.\n\nIn the U.S., the auroras may become visible in some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center's experimental Aurora view line. The visibility for viewing also will depend on local weather conditions and city lights.\n\nThe northern lights may also be visible low on the horizon in several cities, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\n\nThose include:\n\nBoise, Idaho\n\nCheyenne, Wyoming\n\nLincoln, Nebraska\n\nIndianapolis\n\nAnnapolis, Maryland\n\nWhen is the best time to see the northern lights?\n\nSolar storms send particles flowing from the sun that get caught up in Earth's magnetic field, causing colorful auroras to form as they interact with molecules of atmospheric gases. In the months ahead, the resulting glowing auroras may be quite a sight – if you look up at the right time.\n\nEven though conditions are prime for more impending aurora shows, experts have long struggled to accurately forecast exactly when and where the phenomenon will ever occur. Even the best predictions can accurately be made only a few days or even hours in advance.\n\nBut as a rule of thumb, if the weather is clear, the best aurora is usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, according to NOAA. And if it looks as if the northern lights will flare up near you, you should get away from cities and travel to dark locations free from light pollution so you can best see them.\n\nThe agency also maintains an aurora dashboard that should help skygazers track the phenomenon.\n\nWhat causes the northern lights\n\nThe auroras are a natural light display in Earth's sky that are famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks.\n\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and even pink dance about in the sky depends on the altitude where the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\n\nWhy northern lights activity is increasing\n\nNow that the sun is at the height of its 11-year cycle, the increase in solar activity has more frequently fueled \"space weather\" that produces the right conditions for northern lights to flourish.\n\nRegions of intense magnetic activity known as sunspots are proliferating on the solar surface and are capable of releasing intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares that can hurtle toward Earth at the speed of light, according to NOAA. Some of the flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or clouds of plasma and charged particles, that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\n\nThese ejections can collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest effects of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms that unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\n\nWhat's more, because NASA expects the solar maximum to continue into 2025, aurora chasers should have plenty more opportunities to catch the northern lights.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

But the hip-hop superstar delivered a fiery speech that featured stinging soundbites delivered with her signature swagger.\n\nAfter taking the stage in a Jackie Kennedy-esque power suit, Cardi B briefly got choked up and said she was a bit nervous. But it didn't take long for her to get her confidence back.\n\n\"Are we ready to make history?\" she called out to cheers.\n\n\"I do not take lightly the call to show up, the call to speak up, the call to deliver a message that has been on my heart for a hot minute now,\" she said.\n\nShe also drew comparisons between herself and the vice president.\n\n\"Just like Kamala Harris, I too have been the underdog. I have been underestimated, my success belittled and discredited,\" she said. \"Women have to work ten times harder, perform ten times better and still people question how we got to the top.\"\n\n\"I can't stand a bully,\" Cardi B continued. \"But just like Kamala, I always stand up to one.\"\n\nShe specifically criticized Trump's comments that he was going to protect women, \"whether they like it or not.\"\n\n\"If his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don't want it,\" she said.\n\nWomen in the spotlight\n\nWomen, particularly Black women, took center stage — and really the whole stage — at Friday night's rally.\n\nThere was the speech from Cardi B.\n\nThere were also performances from female rappers, hip-hop stars and DJs, including trailblazer MC Lyte and fresh faces GloRilla, Flo Milli and DJ Gemini Gilly.\n\nHarris also spoke to women, and those who support them, during her speech.\n\n\"We are the promise of America, the fathers and mothers and grandparents who work hard every day for their children's future, in the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom and the men who support them.\"\n\nMilwaukee and Wisconsin could decide things (Yes, again)\n\nSpeakers made it clear that Milwaukee and Wisconsin need to turn out to vote in this election.\n\nMultiple speakers urged people to vote early or have a plan to vote on Election Day. They also called on attendees to volunteer and talk to friends, family and neighbors about voting.\n\n“Those doors don’t knock themselves,\" Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said. \"This is all hands on deck!\"\n\nJohnson told the crowd gathered at the Wisconsin State Fair Expo Center that the state’s largest city will play a key role in the election.\n\n“We are literally the crossroads of this election, we really, really are,” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said. “And if Milwaukee turns out, then we win.”\n\nSpeakers like Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin also stressed the critical role Wisconsin will play in this election.\n\n“We are the battleground state!” Baldwin said.\n\nHarris calls for bipartisanship\n\nDuring her speech, Harris took her typical shots at Republican Donald Trump, but she also included a call for bipartisanship after the election.\n\n“As president I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges we face,” Harris said. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”\n\nHarris also said she’s willing to listen to those with opposing views.\n\n\"I pledge to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me,” Harris said. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail, I’ll give them a seat at the table.”\n\nHarris thanked Republicans “who never voted for a Democrat before, but put the constitution of the United States above party.\"\n\nHarris says Trump’s comments on Liz Cheney ‘must be disqualifying’\n\nShortly after Vice President Kamala Harris arrived in Wisconsin on Friday, she slammed former President Donald Trump’s comments that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney should have rifles pointed at her over her support for U.S. wars overseas.\n\n“He has increased his violent rhetoric – Donald Trump has – about political opponents and in great detail, great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney,” Harris told reporters in Madison. “This must be disqualifying.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/events/statefair/2015/08/11/kentucky-state-fair-homemade-food/31450027/", "title": "Homemade is the rule at Kentucky State Fair", "text": "Jere Downs\n\n@JereDowns\n\nWhen thousands of culinary contestants tote their cakes, cookies, pies, canned goods and other homemade entries to vie for blue ribbons at the Kentucky State Fair next week, they will see a new sign posted by the pie police.\n\n“ATTENTION,” says a new sign in the South Wing of the fairgrounds. “By entering an item in the culinary department of the Kentucky State Fair, you are acknowledging and certifying that you have used no commercially produced products such as frozen pie shells, boxed cake mixes, canned frostings or any like products.”\n\nThat increased scrutiny follows the case of the Pillsbury Pie Crust. Last year, Valley Station retiree Linda Horton’s buttermilk pie lost its blue ribbon when she disclosed that her Pillsbury pie crust “was so buttery.”\n\nScratch cooking is the abiding rule for most fair contests. In the pie category, for example, page 204 of the Kentucky State Fair Premium List and General Rules states that for “Pies,” Division 3304, “No Commercial Pie Crusts May Be Used.”\n\nStakes are high for contestants and the fair’s reputation, said Culinary Superintendent Stephen Lee.\n\n“We take this seriously,” Lee said. “As much as this is all for fun, we want everybody to be playing in the same sandbox.”\n\nExhibits like homemade food, quilts, crafts and photography are the biggest draw for state fair goers, according to a 2014 survey, Kentucky State Fair spokeswoman Amanda L. Storment said, followed by fair eats like the Kentucky Pork Producer’s fried pork chop sandwich, funnel cake and the Krispy Kreme cheeseburger.\n\nCommercial products are at the heart of some fair cooking contests. Up to 84 cooks have entered the the popular “Evan Williams Bourbon Cooking Competition,” up to 130 are throwing down in the “Great American Spam Championship” and 102 adults and children are crafting sweets for a Kentucky State Fair first, the “Dole Canned Fruit Dessert Competition.”\n\nCommercial contests have their place, especially for the decades-old Spam competition.\n\n“Everybody wants to know when you’re looking at a can of Spam,” Storment said. “What do you do with it?”\n\nEnforcement comes as state fair officials look to boost attendance during the annual event back toward 600,000 annually, from a historic nadir last year of around 515,000.\n\nHomemade food on exhibit “is what fair goers expect to see,” Storment said. “Those culinary entries are just as big as the quilts and the livestock. That is people’s handiwork. That is their talent. A lot of pride goes into that.”\n\nBack in the Culinary Department, just one adult baking category allows a store-bought mix, “Your Favorite Cake, Made with a Commercial Mix and Your Special Ingredients.”\n\nAmong the 4,300 registered entries otherwise, 293 bakers will bring pies, 250 home cooks registered to enter a favorite pickle or relish and another 105 are competing for “Favorite Cookie,” Lee said. For “Favorite Cake,” the most popular contest resulting in a printed recipe in the Courier-Journal, 54 home cooks registered by the July 1 deadline, he added.\n\nThose numbers will grow, Lee added, “because many people bring two or three pies or items apiece.”\n\nA panel of 36 judges award points for qualities like artistry, color, flavor, color of crumb, filling and flakiness. Commercial entries are usually easy to spot, he said.\n\n“You can just sometimes really tell when something is commercially made,” Lee said. “You can taste the chemicals in it and the stabilizers, and the metallic taste.”\n\nAs a result, fair staff will point to the new sign and talk about the rules, Lee said, when each of 2,000 contestants arrive beginning Sunday to place their homemade food on 94 exhibit tables or inside dozens of cabinets and coolers in the South Wing.\n\nThe rules will “be square in the face of people when they bring their items,” Lee said. “Part of my instruction to all my assistants is going to consistently say all day long, “have you seen this sign?”\n\nJere Downs can be reached at (502) 582-4669, @JereDowns on Twitter and Jere Downs on Facebook.\n\nKentucky State Fair Cooking Contests\n\nLook for cooking contests on the Gourmet Garden Stage in South Wing A.

I walked in, I didn’t feel any different than I did in 1965 when I walked in and did the first Blazers hockey game. It’s still got the same atmosphere.”\n\nBrooks has seen it all at State Fair Arena, which is the backdrop one final time for the high school basketball state tournaments before being torn down in May and replaced by new OG&E Coliseum.\n\nFrom hockey games to rodeo shows, Brooks has been to hundreds of events at the arena.\n\n“We really are the gathering place for Oklahoma for a vast majority, vast variety of shows,” Fairgrounds vice president of marketing and public relations Scott Munz said. “And to families that are heavy into wrestling, it’s known as the wrestling venue. To the ones that have played there in the small schools, it’s known as The Big House and it’s known as the basketball venue.\n\n“It’s a concert venue. It’s certainly an equine venue. I mean, there are world championships that have been determined in there over the years.”\n\nState Fair Arena has a storied history of intriguing events.\n\nFrom the Harlem Globetrotters to the Oklahoma City Indoor track meet that featured Olympic pole vaulter Bob Seagren to the state square dance festival, the building that cost $2.4 million to build and open in 1965 featured nearly every event possible.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most notable ones.\n\nPete Maravich ‘cannot be what he’s supposed to be’\n\nEnormous hype surrounded Pete Maravich when he and the LSU basketball team arrived at State Fair Arena for the All-College tournament.\n\nIt was December in 1968, and Brooks called games for Oklahoma City University in those days.\n\nHe saw Maravich take the floor and wasn’t necessarily impressed at first.\n\n“When he warmed up, you looked at him and thought, ‘This guy cannot be what he’s supposed to be,’” Brooks said.\n\nBrooks quickly learned he was wrong about Pistol Pete.\n\n“Of course, the game would start and he was everything,” Brooks said. “He controlled the floor. He was charismatic, and he just brought a magnet of attention, whatever he did.”\n\nThe 6-foot-5 sharpshooting Maravich put on a show as LSU won its three games at the tournament and claimed the championship.\n\nHe scored 45 points against Wyoming, 40 against Oklahoma City University and 53 against Duquesne.\n\nMaravich went back to Oklahoma City on Dec. 30, 1987, as he was inducted into the All-College Hall of Fame.\n\nHe died of a heart attack at the age of 40 just six days later.\n\n“Great player,” Brooks said. “He holds so many records. If they had a 3-point line at that time, you couldn’t even catch him. He was very, very special.”\n\nThe Elvis show that never was\n\nState Fair Arena hosted several well-known musical acts over the years.\n\nAmong them was the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley.\n\nWearing a white jumpsuit unbuttoned down to his stomach, he performed at the arena in 1970.\n\nPresley was scheduled to perform at the arena again, but the show never happened because of his death.\n\n“There are tickets,” Munz said. “You could find tickets that are out there for that performance that were never redeemed, turned in or turned back for refunds.\n\n“People looked at it as a collector’s item. They didn’t care about the $6.50 or whatever the price point was on the ticket. They wanted that piece of rock-and-roll memorabilia.”\n\nState Fair Arena has an impressive lineup history.\n\nAlong with Presley, Elton John, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert played there.\n\nLegendary bands Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Grateful Dead, Grand Funk Railroad, Jethro Tull, Metallica, Chicago and ZZ Top performed as well.\n\n“When we booked Blake Shelton, he was just a guy out of Ada that was getting some local notoriety and some national attention,” Munz said. “And then he’s gone on to become what he is. Same thing with Miranda out of Texas.”\n\nFreckles Brown and ‘The Ride’\n\nFreckles Brown was 46 and nearing the end of his hall-of-fame career.\n\nHe stepped inside State Fair Arena during the 1967 National Finals Rodeo and set out to accomplish something that had never been done.\n\nTornado, a monstrous bull that weighed about 1,850 pounds, was seen as unrideable by many on the bull-riding circuit.\n\nWhen Brown took on the challenge, more than 200 professional bull riders had tried and failed to last eight seconds on Tornado.\n\nBrown proceeded to shock everyone that December night.\n\n\"It was the greatest match,\" longtime NFR general manager Clem McSpadden told The Oklahoman in 1999. \"An old-timer who everybody loved, against Tornado, who everybody had heard about. It was the greatest thing that ever happened to the business.\"\n\nBrown’s legendary performance became known as “The Ride,” and it’s considered one of the best in the sport’s history.\n\nIt is certainly the greatest in the history of State Fair Arena, which hosted the NFR from 1965 through 1978 before it moved to The Myriad and remained there until 1984.\n\nThe NFR has since been in Las Vegas.\n\n“It was a perfect atmosphere as far as I was concerned for National Finals Rodeo,” Brooks said of State Fair Arena.\n\nBrooks feels the same about the American Quarter Horse World Championship, which has been held at the arena since 1976.\n\n“People don’t realize that there are equine people, horse enthusiasts, exhibitors, however you want to identify them, waking up all over the world dreaming of getting to Oklahoma City,” Munz said.\n\nHow State Fair Arena jumpstarted Reba McEntire’s career\n\nOklahoma native Reba McEntire has become one of the most successful stars in country music history, and it all started at State Fair Arena.\n\nMcEntire was discovered in 1974 when she performed the national anthem at the arena during the NFR.\n\nCountry singer Red Steagall heard her and booked her a recording session. That led to her signing a contract with Mercury Records in 1975.\n\nAnd she never forgot that moment in the arena.\n\n“Reba has actually reached out to us,” Munz said. “She wants 10 chairs sent to Poteau for her restaurant down there. She wants 10 seats sent to her house in Nashville.”\n\nA memorial service to heal a wounded city\n\nEleven thousand people packed into the arena on April 23, 1995. Twenty thousand stood outside praying but also listening to those speaking.\n\nThe President of the United States Bill Clinton. The Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating. Evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nThey all spoke just four days after the bombing of the Alfred P.

Thousands of roses were donated to be given to family members and spread throughout the arena.\n\nEven a small group of firefighters, rescue workers and volunteers attended, with Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper Charlie Hanger receiving a huge ovation for arresting Timothy McVeigh, who was charged, convicted and executed for the bombing.\n\nAnd Clinton offered these words: \"If anybody thinks that Americans are mostly mean and selfish, they ought to come to Oklahoma. If anybody thinks Americans have lost the capacity for love and caring and courage, they ought to come to Oklahoma.\"\n\n‘Thousands of people in this arena here to watch wrestling’\n\nGoing to State Fair Arena each year is basically a guarantee for Bobby Williams.\n\nThe head wrestling coach at Tuttle High School, Williams has led the Tigers to state titles at the arena every season during his tenure.\n\nBoth the junior high and high school state tournaments have taken place annually at State Fair Arena.\n\nThe tournaments, which concluded Saturday for the final time, are always a huge deal for communities across the state.\n\n“All the classes there together and towns coming out to support a couple of individuals, it’s loud, it’s fun,” Williams said. “You can feel it on the floor. You look around and there’s thousands of people in this arena here to watch wrestling. It’s awesome. The atmosphere is always great.”\n\nWilliams won three individual state titles during his high school wrestling days at Tuttle.\n\nBut Williams’ favorite memories are on the coaching side.\n\n“Just having a relationship with athletes and then seeing them reach their goals, parents are all fired up, town’s fired up — those are always the memories that are fun to think back on,” Williams said.\n\n“As an athlete, I just remember running around. You weren’t really thinking about what’s around you. You were just thinking about wrestling when you’re a wrestler. But as a coach, I kind of get to look back or sit back and watch some things unfold and enjoy the moment a little bit more.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/11/01/cardi-b-fires-up-kamala-harris-crowd-slams-donald-trump-in-milwaukee/76005372007/", "title": "Cardi B fires up Kamala Harris crowd, slams Donald Trump in ...", "text": "Cardi B didn't perform for her first Milwaukee appearance ever Friday at Kamala Harris' \"When We Vote We Win\" rally Friday at Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis.\n\nBut the hip-hop superstar offered something that likely was far more impactful than performances of \"WAP\" or \"I Like It\" - a fiery nearly 10-minute speech that drew about as much passion from the crowd as Harris herself Friday, complete with stinging soundbites delivered with her signature, seemingly off the cuff swagger.\n\nBut after making her appearance in a Jackie Kennedy-esque power suit, Cardi B briefly got choked up and said she was a bit nervous. But reading a speech she wrote from a phone, and taking time to take sips of water as she spoke, it didn't take long for Cardi B to get her confidence back.\n\n\"Are we ready to make history,\" she called out to cheers.\n\n\"I do not take lightly the call to show up, the call to speak up, the call to deliver a message that has been on my heart for a hot minute now...\" she said.\n\n\"Just like Kamala Harris, I too have been the underdog.

The U.S. has a $12 billion trade surplus with Britain, making it an outlier from other countries like China that export more goods to the U.S. than it imports.\n\nUnder the still-evolving deal, Trump kept a 10% baseline tariff on British products imported to the United States, but he said that's a \"low number\" compared to the tariffs he wants to maintain for other counties.\n\nThe agreement lowers 25% universal tariffs on automobiles from the UK to 10%, while the 25% rate still applies to vehicles from other countries. Trump also agreed to eliminate 25% tariffs on steel from the UK.\n\nOther details are still in the works, Trump said. Still, U.S. stocks traded higher in the immediate hours of the news spreading of a broad deal between the two longstanding global allies. Trump promised that their efforts would provide billions of dollars in access for U.S. agricultural products such as beef and ethanol.\n\n“They’re opening up their country,” Trump said. “Their country is a little closed and we appreciate it.”\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keri Starmer was put on a speaker phone for the announcement and called it a “really fantastic, historic day” coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the key moment at the end of World War II.\n\n“This is going to boost trade between and across our countries,” Starmer siad.\n\nTrump had imposed reciprocal tariffs on a slew of countries April 2 but later paused most of them for 90 days, saying those nations' leaders were eager to negotiate trade deals. Since then administration officials repeatedly have said they are close to making deals.\n\nThe UK wasn't hit with a reciprocal tariff during Trump's April roll out, but faced a 10% universal tariff and 25% tariffs that Trump imposed on foreign automobiles, steel and aluminum.\n\nBritons will buy U.S. beef and chicken despite additives: Navarro\n\nPeter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, disputed concerns that growth additives would discourage sales of beef and chicken to the United Kingdom.\n\nKansas, Nebraska and Texas are expected to sell more beef, Navarro said of the trade deal President Donald Trump negotiated with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Wisconsin and California are expected to sell more dairy products, he said. Iowa is expected to sell more corn as ethanol, he said.\n\n“There’s joy in farm-ville today,” Navarro told reporters May 8.\n\nAsked if Britons would buy beef raised with hormones or chicken rinsed with chlorine, Navarro said the markets would decide. He argued that “so-called phytosanitary standards” are “simply a tool to suppress” fine agricultural products.\n\n“If more of that comes into the market and the British people don’t want to buy it, that’s one set of facts,” Navarro said. “We believe that once they’ve tasted American beef and chicken that they’d prefer to have it.” - Bart Jansen\n\nTrump: Reduced UK auto tariffs to help Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar cars\n\nPresident Trump said he made a special exception for the United Kingdom by lowering auto tariffs from 25% to 10% to help high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar vehicles that are manufactured in Britain.\n\n“It's a very special car, and it's very limited number, too,” Trump said. “It’s not one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super luxury.”\n\n“That’s really handmade stuff, they've been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he said. “So I said, ‘Let’s help the out with that one.’”\n\nTrump said he will “rarely” make the same decision in negotiations with other countries when it comes to other foreign automobiles. - Joey Garrison\n\nSchumer casts doubt on longevity of Trump’s UK trade deal\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer cast doubt on the durability of President Donald Trump’s trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the details of which are not fully known.\n\nSchumer, D-New York, said in a morning Senate floor speech, ahead of Trump’s announcement, that the trade deal “is likely to be built on quicksand.”\n\n“And with this president, if past is prologue, who knows if this ‘deal’ will actually stick,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n\nSchumer added: “It would be hard to take anything the president says about this deal today seriously, because in all likelihood he will likely change his mind again.” – Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump says 10% tariff could still increase for other countries\n\nTrump’s trade deal with the United Kingdom maintained a 10% universal tariff on the country.\n\nAsked if trade deals with other countries also could result in tariffs staying at 10%, rather than the higher reciprocal tariffs the president threatened last month before pausing most of them, Trump said no.\n\n“The template of 10 is probably the lowest,” he said, suggesting other countries could have a higher tariff. - Zac Anderson\n\nJames Bond cars, films at heart of trade discussions\n\nThe United Kingdom could begin sending more Aston Martin cars – the iconic ride for fictional spy James Bond – to the U.S. under the trade deal, but Trump said potential tariffs on foreign films were still open to discussion.\n\n“James Bond has nothing to worry about, that I can tell you,” Trump said to laughter in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump noted that he was friends with Sean Connery, the late Scottish actor who created the Bond character in film. Trump has two golf courses in Scotland, and Connery helped resolve a zoning dispute for the one in Aberdeen.\n\n“Sean Connery was a friend of mine. He was a great guy,” Trump said. “He said, ‘Let the bloody bloke build his golf courses.’” - Bart Jansen\n\nUK says trade deal with the US eliminates steel tariffs\n\nThe United Kingdom said in a press release that the trade deal with the United States will help a steel industry “on the brink of collapse.”\n\nThe U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on foreign steel. The UK won’t face those tariffs now, according to the release.\n\n“The Prime Minister negotiated the 25% tariff down to zero, meaning UK steelmakers can carry on exporting to the US,” the release states. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump says he’s not overstating deal\n\nResponding to a question about the significance of the trade deal announced with the UK, Trump said it’s incorrect to suggest he’s overstating its importance.\n\n“This is a maxed out deal,” he said, adding: “It’s a very big deal right now but I think it’s going to grow.” - Zac Anderson\n\nU.S. keeps 10% tariffs on UK goods: Lutnick\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said 10% tariffs would remain under the trade deal, but that the United Kingdom was opening its markets for an estimated $5 billion in U.S. beef, ethanol and machinery.\n\nLutnick said a 25% U.S. tariff on automobiles would be reduced to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles. Lutnick also said a British airline would announce later May 8 that it would buy $10 billion of Boeing planes. - Bart Jansen and Joey Garrison\n\nTrump says UK has agreed to eliminate ‘non-tariff barriers’\n\nAlthough the details of the trade deal are still unclear, Trump said the United Kingdom has agreed to reduce or eliminate the number of “non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products.\"\n\n“This is now turning out, I think, really to be a great deal for both countries because it will be really great for the UK also,” Trump said.\n\nUK’s Starmer says deal will boost trade between countries\n\nUnited Kingdom Keir Starmer, talking through a speaker phone, touted the moment as a “fantastic, historic day” as the U.S. and Britain agreed to a trade deal.\n\n“Really important deal,” Starmer said. “This is going to boost trade across our countries. It's going to not only protect jobs, but create jobs, opening market access. And as you say, Donald, the timing couldn't be more apt.” - Joey Garrison\n\nTreasury sanctions 4 Chinese companies for buying, delivering Iranian oil\n\nIn another trade arena, the Treasury Department announced May 8 it sanctioned a Chinese refinery and three port terminal operators for buying or helping deliver hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had signed an executive order to block sales of Iranian oil as part of an economic pressure campaign against the Middle East country working to develop its own nuclear weapon.\n\n“The United States remains resolved to intensify pressure on all elements of Iran’s oil supply chain to prevent the regime from generating revenue to further its destabilizing agenda,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. - Bart Jansen\n\nRubio calls trade deal ‘an important step’ toward more\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio praised the trade deal with the United Kingdom as “an important step towards fair and reciprocal trade” with other countries around the world.\n\n“Looking forward to the many great deals your administration will deliver for the American people!” Rubio wrote on social media. -Bart Jansen\n\nStocks up on word of trade deal\n\nU.S. stock markets rose in initial trading after Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 198.6 points or 0.48% at the opening of trading May 8. The S&P 500 rose 32.3 points or 0.57% in initial trading. And the Nasdaq composite rose 182 points or 1.03% at the opening bell. - Reuters\n\nThe United Kingdom is the ninth-largest trading partner with U.S.\n\nFinal details on Trump's trade deal with the United Kingdom remain under wraps.\n\nBut the two nations exchange a much smaller amount of goods and services – largely cars and chemicals heading to the U.S. – than the U.S. does with its largest trading partners.\n\nThe U.S. exported nearly $80 billion in goods and services in 2024, according to the Census Department, while importing about $68 billion. That ranks the United Kingdom ninth in trade with the U.S.Machinery and transport equipment was also the main goods exported from the United Kingdom to the U.S. in 2023. Cars represented nearly half the UK exports to the U.S., ahead of Germany and the Netherlands, according to that country’s trade office.\n\nChemical exports, mostly for pharmaceuticals, account for nearly one-quarter of the exports to the U.S. They were the second largest group of UK commodities exported to the U.S.\n\nThe United Kingdom figures are dwarfed by U.S. trade with Mexico at $839 billion in goods and serves exchanging across the U.S.-Mexico border last year. Canada traded $762 billion in goods and services with the U.S., while China coming in at $582 billion in trade with the U.S.\n\nTrump met with Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney on May 6, and talks are set to begin with China. - Bart Jansen\n\nU-Michigan economist: Not a major trade deal\n\nTrump’s announcement already is being met with skepticism.\n\nUniversity of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers told CNN he wouldn’t consider it a major trade deal, noting the United Kingdom only accounts for about 3% of U.S. trade.\n\n“The president’s a showman, he’s going to tell you there’s all sorts of wonderful things about it,” Wolfers said. - Zac Anderson\n\nTrump: 'We don't have to sign deals'\n\nTrump commented about the intense interest in the trade deals during a May 6 meeting with the prime minister of Canada.\n\n\"Everyone says: 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?\" Trump said. \"We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now . . . if we wanted. We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market.\"\n\nThe president also expressed frustration with the constant questions. \"I wish they'd stop asking how many deals are you signing this week,\" he said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers during a May 6 committee hearing that deals could be signed soon.\n\n\"I would think that perhaps as early as this week we will be announcing trade deals with some of our largest trading partners,\" Bessent said. - Zac Anderson\n\nWhat's the status of U.S.-China trade talks?\n\nThere are 18 countries that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as \"major trading partners.\" He said negotiations have begun with all of them except China, but talks between U.S. and Chinese officials are now scheduled.\n\nBessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are traveling to Switzerland on May 8, where they will meet with China's \"lead representative on economic matters.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is also meeting on May 8 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Jinping told Putin their two countries should be \"friends of steel\", as they pledged to boost cooperation to a new level at a time of heightened confrontation with the West.\n\nAt talks in the Kremlin, the two leaders cast themselves as defenders of a new world order no longer dominated by the United States. - Reuters/Zac Anderson\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/20/read-the-entire-transcript-of-president-joe-bidens-dnc-speech/74867260007/", "title": "Read the entire transcript of President Joe Biden's DNC speech", "text": "President Joe Biden put a bow on the end of night one in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention. He spoke to the crowd gathered in the United Center for just under an hour.\n\nThe convention will last through Thursday and will feature many more headlining speakers like Barack and Michelle Obama, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, former President Bill Clinton and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Everything will conclude with remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris, who will officially accept her nomination for president.\n\nBiden's time on the stage was preceded by a passionate speech from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, remarks from Hillary Clinton and first lady Jill Biden and an appearance from Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden's daughter Ashley Biden introduced him to the stage, saying he was \"the OG girl dad\" and calling on Americans to \"Work harder than you have ever worked before in your life\" this election season.\n\nRead the entire speech from Biden here.\n\nBiden remarks DNC night one:\n\nThat was my daughter!\n\nThank you.\n\nI love you.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “Thank you, Joe”]\n\nI tell you what, to my dearest daughter Ashley. God, love you. You’re incredible. Thank you for the introduction and for being my courageous heart, along with Hunter and our entire family, and especially our rock, Jill. It was those of you who know us, she still leaves me both breathless and speechless. Everybody knows her, I love her more than she loves me. She walks down the stairs, and I still get that going boom, boom, boom. You all who know me, know I’m not kidding.\n\nLet’s give a special round of applause to our first lady Jill Biden.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, for real, he’d say “Joey, family is the beginning, the middle and the end.”\n\nAnd I love you all, folks. And America, I love you!\n\nFolks, let me ask you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to vote for freedom?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAre you ready to vote for democracy and for America?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAs president and vice president of the United States.\n\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly four years ago, in winter, on the steps of the Capitol, on a cold January day I raised my right hand, and I swore on oath to you and to god to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States. In front of me, in front of me, was a city surrounded by the national guard, behind me a capitol just two weeks before had been overrun by a violent mob.\n\nBut I knew then, from the bottom of my heart, that I knew now, there is no place in America for political violence. None. You cannot say you love your country only when you win. In that moment, I wasn’t looking to the past, I was looking to the future.\n\nI spoke to the work at hand. The moment we had to meet, it was, as I told you then, a winter of peril and possibility. Of peril and possibility.\n\nWe were in the grip of a once-in-a-century pandemic, historic joblessness, a call for racial justice long overdue, clear and present threats to our very democracy.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd yet, and yet I believed then, and I believe now, that progress was and is possible just as it is achievable. And our best days are not behind us, they’re before us. Now it’s summer, the winter has passed. And with a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy, democracy has delivered. And now, democracy must be preserved.\n\nYou’ve heard me say it before, we’re facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole; I mean it literally.\n\nWe're in the battle for the very soul of America.\n\nI ran for president in 2020 because of what I saw at Charlottesville in August of 2017. Extremists coming out of the woods, carrying torches, their veins bulging from their necks, carrying Nazi swastikas and chanting the same exact antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early thirties.\n\nNeo-Nazis, white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, so emboldened by a president then in the White House that they saw as an ally. They didn’t even bother to wear their hoods. Hate was on the march in America.\n\nOld ghosts, and new garments, stirring up the oldest divisions, stoking the oldest fears, giving oxygen to the oldest forces that they long sought to tear apart America.\n\nIn the process, a young woman was killed. When I contacted her mother to ask about what happened, she told me. When the president was asked what he thought had happened. Donald Trump said, and I quote, “There were very fine people on both sides.” My god. That’s what he said. That is what he said and what he meant.\n\nThats’s when I realized I had to listen to the admonition of my dead son. I could not stay on the sidelines, so I ran.\n\nI had no intention of running again. I just lost part of my soul, but I ran with a deep conviction. An America I know and believe, and an America where honesty, dignity, decency still matter. An America where everyone has a fair shot, and hate has no safe harbor. An America where the fundamental creed of this nation that all of us are created equal is still very much alive.\n\nAnd a broad coalition of Americans joined with me. 81 million voters voted for us. More than any time in all of history.\n\nBecause of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy. As your president, I been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back, to stand against hate and violence in all its forms, to be a nation where we not only live with but thrive on diversity, demonizing no one, leaving no one behind, and becoming the nation that we professed to be.\n\nI also ran to rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class. I made a commitment to you that I’d be a president for all America, whether you voted for me or not.\n\nWe have done that. Studies show the major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red states than blue, because the job of the president is to deliver to all America.\n\nBecause of you, I’m not exaggerating, because of you, we’ve had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever. Period.\n\nWhen I say we, I mean Kamala and me.\n\nJust think about it. COVID no longer controls our lives. We’ve gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world.\n\nRecord 60 million new jobs, record small business growth, record high stock market, record high 401Ks. Wages up, inflation down, way down, and continuing to go down. The smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years and yes, we both know we have more to do, but we’re moving in the right direction.\n\nMore Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history. And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate low-prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.\n\nAnd guess who cast the tie breaking vote? Vice President, soon to be President, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. Instead of paying $400 a month for insulin seniors with diabetes, will pay $35 a month. The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every seniors’ total prescription cost can be capped at $2,000, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.\n\nAnd what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.\n\nYou know what we just passed saved? It saved $160 billion dollars over the next decade.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices ... to the big pharma.\n\nBut look, folks. Thank you, Kamala, too. Look.\n\nFolks, how can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world?\n\nDonald Trump promised infrastructure week every week for four years, and he never built a damn thing.\n\nBut now because of Kamala and I’ve done, remember we’re told we couldn’t get it done, remember when we came into office, we couldn’t get anything passed?\n\nBut right now, we’re giving America an infrastructure decade, not week.\n\nWe’re modernizing, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our trains, our buses.\n\nRemoving every lead pipe from schools and homes so every child can drink clean water. Providing affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where they live. Unlike, not unlike, what Roosevelt did with electricity.\n\nAnd so much more. We are uniting the country. We're growing our economy. We're improving our quality of life and we’re building a better America. Because that’s who we are.\n\nHow can we be the strongest nation in the world, without leading the world in science and technology?\n\nAfter years of importing 90% of our semiconductor chips from abroad, which America invented those chips. Our CHIPS and Science Act meant the private companies from around the world are now investing literally 10’s of billions of dollars to build new chip factories right here in America. And over that period, they’ll create tens of thousands of jobs. And many of those jobs, so-called fabs, the buildings that make those chips, are being constructed now.\n\nAnd guess what? The average salary in those fabs, the size of a football field, will be over $100,000 a year and you don’t need a college degree.\n\nBecause of you and so many electeds out there, American manufacturing is back. Where those to say we wouldn’t lead the world in manufacturing? 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Our Republican friends, and others, made sure they’d go abroad to get the cheapest labor. We used to import products and export jobs, now we export American products and create American jobs. Right here in America, where jobs belong.\n\nWith every new job, with every new factory, pride and hope is being brought back to communities throughout the country that were left behind. You know, you’re from them many of you, you know what it’s like when that factory closed, where your mother, your father, your grandmother, grandfather worked, and now you’re back, providing once again, proving that Wall Street didn’t built America, the middle class built America and unions, unions built the middle class.\n\nIt's been my view since I came to the Senate. That's why I’m proud to have been the first president to walk the picket line and be labeled the most pro-union president in history. And I accept it. It's a fact. Because when unions do well, we all do well.\n\nYou got it man, you got it.\n\nI agree. I’m proud.\n\nLook, remember we were told we couldn’t get anything done. We couldn't get anything done in the Congress. Well with your support, we passed the most significant climate law in the history of mankind.\n\nFor $370 billion dollars, cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, launching a climate corps, similar to AmeriCorps or Peace Corps creating tens of thousands of jobs for young people in the future who are going to make sure this continues.\n\nCreating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy for American workers including the IBW installing 500,000, 500,000 charging stations all across America.\n\nAnd in the process, reducing carbon emissions, and we’re seeing it, we’re seeing to it that the first beneficiaries environmental issues are those fence lines communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution. Louisiana and Delaware, Route nine, all the factories, all those chemical factories are right next to the poorest neighborhoods. They’re the ones we’re going to bring back.\n\nAnd how, how can we be the greatest nation in the world without the best education system in the world?\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican friends, that not only they can't think they can’t read very well. Seriously, think about it.\n\nLook at their Project 2025. Want to do away with the Department of Education.\n\nWell during the pandemic, Kamala helped states and cities get back their get back their schools back open, and we gave public school teachers a raise, we created apprenticeships with businesses in the communities, putting students on path, to a good paying job, whether or not they go to college.\n\nAnd by the way, we’re making college a hell of a lot more affordable. Increasing Pell grants by $900. Over $15 billion dollars for HBCUs, minority service, including Hispanic institutions and tribal colleges.\n\nWe kept our commitment to provide more student relief than ever by lifting the burden of helping millions of families so they could get married, start a family, buy a home and begin to build family wealth and contribute to the community, and grow our economy.\n\nIt's not costing us, it’s creating more wealth.\n\nWe fundamentally transformed how our economy grows. From the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down.\n\nYou know, my dad used to say there wasn’t a whole hell of a lot to drop down on my kitchen table at the end of the month. I come from basic middle-class family: Three-bedroom house, four kids, a grandpop living with us, decent neighborhood, but never a penny to spare. And look, that top-down notion, it never worked. Lota Democrats didn’t think it worked, thought it worked, but it doesn’t.\n\nAnd when we did all that, what we’ve done, everybody could do well. Everybody. Donald Trump calls America a failing nation.\n\n[Crowd boos]\n\nNo, I’m serious. Think about this. Think about this.\n\nHe publicly, he says to the whole world.\n\nI’m going to say something outrageous, I know more foreign leaders by their first names than and know them well than anybody alive just because I’m so damn old.\n\nAnd I’m not joking.\n\nThink of the message he sends around the world, when he talks about America being a failing nation. He says we’re losing. He’s the loser. He’s dead wrong. Many of you are very successful people who travel the world.\n\nName me a country in the world that doesn’t think we’re the leading nation in the world.\n\nWithout America, not a joke, think about it, I’m being literal, who could lead the world other than the United States of America? Well guess what? America’s winning and the world’s better off for it.\n\nAmerica is more prosperous, and Americans are safer today than under Donald Trump.\n\nTrump continues to lie about crime in America, like everything else.\n\nGuess what? On his watch, the murder rate went up 30%, the biggest increase in history. Meanwhile, we made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety, ever. Now, the murder rate is falling faster than any time in history.\n\nViolent crime has dropped to the lowest level in more than 50 years. And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the oval office instead of a convicted felon.\n\nFolks, distinguished senator from the Senate from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.\n\nAnd what makes me ashamed when I travel the world, which I do, more children in America are killed by a gunshot than any other cause in the United States. More die from a bullet than cancer, accidents, than anything else in the United States of America. My god. That’s why Kamala and I are proud, we beat the NRA and we passed the first major bipartisan gun-safety law in 30 years.\n\nI'm serious. That comes from here. And now it’s time to ban assault weapons again.\n\n[Crowd cheers]\n\nAnd demand universal background checks. It’s hard, I never thought I’d stand before a crowd of Democrats and refer to a president as a liar so many times. No, I’m not trying to be funny. It’s sad.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you. Trump killed the strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States. That we negotiated with the Senate Republicans, took four weeks.\n\nOnce it passed, and everybody acknowledged most expansive border change in history, he called senators to say, “Don’t support the bipartisan bill.” He said, “It would help me politically and hurt him politically.” My god. No, I’m serious. Think about it. Not a joke.\n\nNot trying to be funny, but it's sad that Trump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you: Trump killed the largest, strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States that we negotiated with Senate Republicans in just four weeks. Once it passed and acknowledged the border change in American history, he called Senators and said, \"Don’t support the bipartisan Senate bill.\" He said it would help me politically and hurt him politically. My God. Seriously, think about it—it’s not a joke. Even ask the press who don’t like me, and they’ll tell you that’s true.\n\nTypically Trump, once again putting himself first and America last. Then I had to take executive action. As a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office. And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they are \"poisoning the blood of America\" or \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting Dreamers and more.\n\nAnd here’s what else I believe in: protecting your freedom — your freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love, and your freedom to choose. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that you heard earlier tonight — the U.S. Supreme Court majority wrote the following: \"Women are not without electoral or political power.\" No kidding. MAGA Republicans found out the power of women in 2022, and Donald Trump is going to find out the power of women in 2024. Watch.\n\nAnd Trump’s MAGA Republican right-wingers seek to erase history. We Democrats continue to write history and make more history. I’m proud. I’m proud to have kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a symbol for every young woman in America that you can do anything. I’m proud I kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and that taps into the full talent of our nation. The most diverse Cabinet in history, including the first Black woman of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President — and who will soon serve as the 47th President of the United States. She is good.\n\nLook... thank you, Kamala (chanting). Folks, I’ve long said we have many obligations as a nation, but I got in trouble years ago for saying I make no apologies. We have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home — and when they don’t. That’s why I’m so proud to have written and signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever helping veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials like burn pits and Agent Orange.\n\nI was around during the Vietnam War. It’s hard — no one was able to prove that their illness was a consequence of Agent Orange, and no one was able to prove initially that because they lived near burn pits, like my son did in Iraq for a year, that it was the cause of their illness. But because of the PACT Act, a surviving spouse with two children is now eligible for a stipend of about $3,000 a month, and those children who lost a parent are eligible for tuition benefits to go to college and get job training. It’s already helping over 1 million veterans and their families so far. Well, I love them, and I’m so proud of my son’s service. We get it.\n\nGuess who doesn’t get it and doesn’t respect our veterans? We know from his own chief of staff, four-star General John Kelly, that Trump, when in Europe, would not go to the gravesites in France of the brave service members who gave their lives for this country. He called them \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" Who in the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? Those are not the words of a person worthy of being Commander-in-Chief — period. Not then, not now, not ever. I mean that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Just as no Commander-in-Chief should ever bow down to a dictator the way Trump bows down to Putin.\n\nI never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris never will. We will never bow down. When Trump left office, Europe and NATO were in tatters. Not a joke. The \"America First\" doctrine changed our whole image in the world. Well, I spent — they gave the hours, about 190 hours total — my counterparts, heads of state in Europe, to strengthen NATO. We did. We united Europe like it hadn’t been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO. Ten days before he died, Henry Kissinger called and said, \"Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at Russia with dread.\"\n\nWell, guess what? Putin thought he'd take Kyiv in three days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free! When I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. They haven't. No one's saying that now!\n\nWe'll keep working to bring hostages home, end the war in Gaza, and bring peace and security to the Middle East. As you know, I wrote a peace treaty for Gaza. A few days ago, I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to that goal than we've been since October 7th.\n\nWe're working around the clock, my Secretary of State and I, to prevent a wider war, reunite hostages with their families, and surge humanitarian aid, health services, and food assistance into Gaza now. To end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people, and finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire in this war.\n\nThose protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides. Just as we worked around the clock to bring home wrongfully detained Americans and others from Russia, in one of the most complicated swaps in history, but they're home. Kamala and I are going to keep working to bring all Americans wrongfully detained around the world home. I mean it.\n\nFolks, I've got five months left in my presidency. I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done. It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. I love the job, but I love my country more.\n\nAll those people who said I should step down, that's not true. We love our country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. In 2024, we need you to vote. We need you to keep the Senate. We need you to win back the House of Representatives. We need you to beat Donald Trump.\n\nKamala and Tim, President and Vice President of the United States of America. Look, they'll continue to lead America forward, creating more jobs, standing up for workers, growing the economy, lowering the costs to American families so they just have a little more breathing room. We've made incredible progress with more work to do.\n\nKamala and Tim will continue to take on corporate greed and bring down the cost of insulin to $35 a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. They'll cap prescription drug costs at a total of $2,000, not just for seniors, but for everyone. And folks, that's going to save Americans tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFolks, they'll make housing more affordable, building 3 million new homes, providing $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, more than the $10,000 we approved. Donald Trump wants new taxes on imported goods, food, gas, clothing, and more. You know what that would cost the average family, according to the experts? $3,900 a year in taxes. No, that's just a fact. Kamala and Tim will make the child care tax credit permanent, lifting millions of children out of poverty and helping millions of families get ahead.\n\nAnd you know what Trump did? He created the largest debt any president has in four years with his $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. Well, Trump has a new plan. He wants to provide a $5 billion tax cut for corporations that are very wealthy. Read it. It would put us further in debt. And folks, you know we have 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? 8.2%. If we just increase their taxes, as we proposed, to 25%, which isn't even the highest tax rate, it would raise $500 billion new dollars over 10 years. And they'd still be very wealthy. Look, Kamala and Tim are going to make them pay their fair share.\n\nThey'll protect Social Security and Medicare. Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Kamala and Tim will protect your freedom. They'll protect your right to vote. They'll protect your civil rights. And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh, he will. You know Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can to stop him. And that's why you have to elect senators and representatives who will restore Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe ancient Greeks taught us that character is destiny. Character is destiny. For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug are people of character. It's been our honor to serve alongside them. And we know that Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character. Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made in my whole career.\n\nNow that we've gotten to know each other, we've become close friends. She's tough. She's experienced. And she has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best presidents, she was also vice president. But she'll be a president our children can look up to. She'll be a president respected by world leaders because she already is. She'll be a president we can all be proud of. And she will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\n\nThis will be the first presidential election since January 6th. On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country. And that threat, this is not hyperbole, that threat is still very much alive. Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. Think about that. He's promising a bloodbath if he loses, in his words. And that he'll be a dictator on day one, in his own words. By the way, this sucker means it. No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Anybody else said that in the past, you'd think he was crazy, you'd think it was an exaggeration, but he means it. We can't let that happen.\n\nFolks, all of us carry a special obligation: Independents, Republicans, Democrats. We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024. The vote each of us casts this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail. It's that simple. It's that serious. The power is literally in your hands. History is in your hands. Not hyperbole. It's in your hands. America's future is in your hands.\n\nLet me close with this. Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter and modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, grow up to sit behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. That's because America is, and always has been, a nation of possibilities. Possibilities. We must never lose that. Never.\n\nKamala and Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities. Not just for a few of us, but for all of us. Join me in dedicating your whole heart to this effort. And with all my heart, I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz camp have ever seen.\n\nEach of us has our own American story. For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us. It captures the best of who we are as a nation. The song is called \"American Anthem.\" There's one verse that stands out, and I can't sing worth a damn, so I'm not going to try. I'll just quote it: \"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart, when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.\"\n\nI've made a lot of mistakes in my career. But I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation. And I've been blessed a million times in return for the support of the American people. I really have been too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet, and now I'm too old to stay as president. But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nI can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, giving my word as a Biden: I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States Senator. I mean it.\n\nFolks, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America! And there's nothing we cannot do when we do it together.\n\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/election-2024-live-updates-house-control/76094069007/", "title": "Election 2024 recap: Dozens of House races still not decided", "text": "All eyes were on vote counts in pivotal U.S. House races Thursday as both political parties hoped to seize control of the lower chamber for 2025. It's a last chance at power for Democrats after Donald Trump claimed the White House early Wednesday while Republicans gained a majority in the Senate.\n\nIt will take 218 seats to rule the House, and although neither party has reached the threshold, the numbers appear to favor the GOP. The Associated Press count put Democrats in 197 seats while Republicans had claimed 209. Dozens of races remained too close to call Thursday afternoon.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats locked down two seats. Rep. Val Hoyle, a first-term congresswoman seeking reelection in western Oregon, defeated Republican Monique DeSpain, an Air Force veteran. Hoyle succeeded longtime Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio in 2022. And in New York state, Laura Gillen ended the reelection bid of Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry defended his seat. Elsewhere in the commonwealth, GOP state Rep. Ryan MacKenzie defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep.

Keep up with live coverage from across the USA TODAY Network.\n\nDonald Trump says he'll have lunch with Joe Biden soon\n\nDonald Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he and President Joe Biden have agreed to have lunch together \"very shortly\" as the former president prepares to return to the White House.\n\nBiden in a speech on Thursday pledged his administration's full support for a smooth transition of power.\n\n\"In a democracy the will of the people always prevails,\" said Biden, addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden. \"Yesterday I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory. And I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky, Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump names Susie Wiles as White House Chief of Staff\n\nAs expected, Donald Trump has asked 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles to be the new White House Chief of Staff.\n\n“Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nTrump described Wiles as \"tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected ... It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history.\"\n\nWiles is the daughter of former pro football player and NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRacist texts about plantations, KKK reported nationwide after and before election: Reports\n\nMultiple people in different states have reported receiving racially motivated texts a day before or after the 2024 election, with messages ranging from threats of the Ku Klux Klan to directives to \"pick cotton at the nearest plantation,\" according to multiple reports and local law enforcement officials.\n\nResidents in at least Georgia, Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina spoke to local newspapers or TV stations about the anonymous text messages they received either before or after Election Day. A woman, who Fox 2 in Detroit identified as Renee, shared the text message she received around 9:50 p.m. on Wednesday with the TV station.\n\n\"Good afternoon Renee! You have been chosen to pick cotton at your nearest plantation,\" the text message read, per Fox 2. \"Be ready at 10am with all of your personal items & possessions because you will never see them again. We will pick you up in a white bus. You will be checked for drugs & other substances! Once you make it here you will be brought to your designed area. You are in group 10B\".\n\nUSA TODAY contacted the FBI about the text messages on Thursday but did not immediately receive a response.\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse\n\nRepublican Dave McCormick ousts incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania Senate race\n\nGOP businessman Dave McCormick has ousted Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, toppling a three-term incumbent he’d relentlessly attacked as ineffectual and weak.\n\nHe prevailed by chipping away at his opponent's significant advantages as someone who has campaigned across the commonwealth for decades and whose name has been prominent in Pennsylvania politics for generations.\n\nThe race drew national attention for its potential to flip a seat from blue to red in the Senate, where Democrats have enjoyed a slim majority.\n\n– Bethany Rodgers\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell says he won’t resign if Trump asks him to step down\n\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday he won’t step down if Donald Trump asks him to resign.\n\n“No,” Powell said when posed that question at his first press conference since Trump’s victory this week over Kamala Harris.\n\nPressed whether he believes he would be legally obligated to step down, Powell responded, “No.” He later clarified that he believes that he would not be obligated to leave under federal law.\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell to his first four-year term in 2017, has regularly criticized Powell’s performance as the head of the nation’s central banking system, with the power to lower and raise interest rates. The Fed lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point Thursday, its second straight rate cut amid easing inflation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reappointed Powell to a second four-year term in 2021.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump pledges to follow through on mass deportations – and doesn't say what it might cost\n\nDonald Trump in an interview with NBC News pledged to follow though with mass deportations of migrants who crossed the border illegally – and denied concerns about the cost of his plan.\n\n\"It’s not a question of a price tag ... we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC, claiming that too many criminals and drug lords are in the country illegally. The president-elect has not elaborated on the details of how such a massive undertaking might work.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance has estimated Trump's actions could result in 1 million people being removed from the country each year, a pace the nonpartisan American Immigration Council estimated would cost about $88 billion annually. To deport all the people in the U.S. without authorization would take about a decade and cost nearly a trillion dollars, the council said.\n\nIn his chat with NBC, Trump said immigration played a major role in his election win. Trump also confirmed that he had \"nice\" and \"very respectful\" calls with Harris and Biden.\n\nHarris \"talked about (the) transition, and she said she’d like it to be smooth as can be,\" Trump said. \"Which I agree with, of course.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden stands by late departure from 2024 race, White House says\n\nJoe Biden stands by his decision to drop out of the race and the timing of his departure, the White House said Thursday, amid criticism from some Democrats that he should have done so earlier.\n\n“He was very proud of when he made that decision to hand over the torch, pass the torch to the vice president,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “He believed it was the right decision to make at that time. He believed that she was ready.”\n\nSome Democrats have criticized Biden for waiting until July 21 before to drop out of the election. Exiting a year earlier would have allowed for an open competitive primary for Democrats to field a nominee.\n\nAsked whether Biden believes he would won had he stayed in the race, Jean-Pierre reiterated the president believes he “made the right decision.”\n\nJean-Pierre would not not say whether Biden accepts any blame for Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to Trump.\n\n“He’s going to respect the will of the people,” she said.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nWhite House blames ‘global headwinds’ after Harris election loss\n\nThe White House blamed “global headwinds” facing incumbent political leaders worldwide as an underlying factor in Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed Thursday to global supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled an increase in inflation in the United States and around the world over the last couple years.\n\n\"What we saw two nights ago was not unusual to what we have seen from the incumbents around the world on the global stage,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak lost reelection this year, French President Emmanuel Macron suffered parliamentary losses, and the parties of prime ministers of Japan and South Korea lost majorities in their respective legislative bodies, among several other setbacks for incumbents.\n\nBiden committed to a peaceful transfer of power in a Rose Garden speech Thursday but has not addressed reporters following Trump’s resounding election victory, which saw Biden’s party lose considerable support among Latino men and working-class voters.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of postmortem analysis of what happened in the coming days, in the coming weeks, even in the coming months,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And so, I'm going to leave those questions to the election experts. That is certainly not my role today.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump to donors: What should I do on day one?\n\nThe Trump campaign has sent a new text message to donors, but it is asking for advice rather than money.\n\n\"I have one more question to ask you before I take back the White House,\" Trump said in the message. \"WHAT SHOULD BE MY PRIORITY ON DAY ONE OF MY PRESIDENCY?\"\n\nCheckoff options include: \"Build The Wall,\" \"Stop Skyrocketing Crime,\" \"Save The Economy,\" \"Fix Health Care,\" \"Protection The Second Amendment,\" and \"Other.\" During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to be a \"dictator\" on day one when it came to border security and energy production.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump's win could spell the end of Biden's higher education policies\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping election victory likely signals the undoing of much of President Joe Biden’s efforts to reform higher education in the U.S.\n\nIn his years at the helm of the federal government, Biden approved billions of dollars in student loan forgiveness, cracked down on colleges that rip students off and worked to codify new protections for LGBTQ+ students. Those efforts – some of which sparked controversies and brought setbacks – are among the key Democratic priorities that Trump's win threatens.\n\nThe rhetoric of the former president on the campaign trail, and his actions while in office, offer ample evidence of his goals. He spent much of his first term dismantling higher education regulations set by former President Barack Obama, who was unusually hawkish on the issue of college oversight.\n\nTuesday's election results shined a spotlight on the partisan divide between Americans with college degrees and those without them.\n\nThough it’s unclear what the president-elect will accomplish with another four years in the White House, he will likely capitalize on that mandate from noncollege-educated voters to chart a far different path from Biden for America’s universities, and, by extension, for the millions of people who attend college in hopes of securing the best future for themselves and their families.\n\n– Zachary Schermele\n\nLGBTQ+ hotlines experience influx in crisis calls amid 2024 presidential election\n\nCrisis services for the LGBTQ+ community have seen a sharp uptick in usage during election week, according to a national LGBTQ+ organization.\n\nSince around midnight on Tuesday, The Trevor Project's classic crisis services, which include a lifeline, chat and text, have experienced an approximately 125% increase in contact compared to normal days, The Trevor Project CEO Jaymes Black said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThis influx follows a 200% increase in election-related conversations to The Trevor Project's classic crisis services reported Nov. 3-4. Key words like \"election\" and \"rights\" were used to determine this figure, according to a news release.\n\nIncreased rates of outreach to The Trevor Project come after the LGBTQ+ community was commonly thrust into discourse on the presidential campaign trail and as the community feels anxious about future legislation.\n\n– Greta Cross\n\nBiden congratulates Trump, pledges smooth transition\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged his administration's full support Thursday for a smooth transition of power, two days after Vice President Kamala Harris's run to replace him was ended by Trump's triumph.\n\n\"In a democracy the will of the people always prevails,\" said Biden, addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden. \"Yesterday I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory. And I assured him that I would direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That is what the American people deserve.\"\n\nBiden's unifying tone was a sharp contrast to Trump's furious response to defeat four years ago, when Trump alleged baseless claims of fraud in an unrelenting but ultimately failed effort to overturn Biden's victory.\n\nBiden also lauded Harris, saying his \"partner and public servant\" ran an inspiring campaign. Harris, who conceded a day earlier, had claimed the Democratic nomination after Biden dropped out of the race in July amid concerns about his mental acuity.\n\n\"Setbacks are unavoidable but giving up is unforgiveable. We all get knocked down,\" Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"\n\nAlso Thursday, Trump's campaign said Biden had invited him to meet at the White House at an unspecified time. The White House said last week that Biden would attend his successor’s inauguration in January regardless of who that successor was.\n\nAll quiet on the Trump front\n\nLittle has been heard from Trump, who hasn't even posted on Truth Social since his victory speech early Wednesday. Trump is reportedly spending a lot of time on the phone, including calls with world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAnother probable reason for the silence: Team Trump is moving from a political campaign to a government transition. During the campaign, Trump said he didn't want to talk about the transition because it would be bad luck to do so before Election Day. Now the transition talk is likely dominating his time.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nTop House Democrat congratulates Trump on victory\n\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., released a statement Thursday congratulating Trump on his victory.\n\n“I am proud that the Democratic Party does not believe in election denial.

George Linardos, judge advocate, Ancient City Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America\n\nMemorial Day, an American holiday, is observed on the last Monday of May, honoring men and women who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\nOriginally known as Decoration Day, it began after the Civil War and became an official federal holiday in 1971. Many Americans observe Memorial Day by visiting cemeteries or memorials, holding family gatherings and participating in parades.\n\nEarly Observances of Memorial Day\n\nThe Civil War, which ended in the spring of 1865, claimed more lives than any conflict in U.S. history and required the establishment of the country’s first national cemeteries. By the late 1860s, Americans in various towns and cities had begun holding springtime tributes to these countless fallen soldiers, decorating their graves with flowers and reciting prayers.\n\nEach year on Memorial Day a national moment of remembrance takes place at 3 p.m. local time. It is unclear where exactly this tradition originated. Numerous different communities may have independently initiated the memorial gatherings. And some records show that one of the earliest Memorial Day commemorations was organized by a group of freed slaves in Charleston, South Carolina, less than a month after the Confederacy surrendered in 1865.\n\nFor almost as long as there’s been a holiday, there’s been a rivalry about who celebrated it first.\n\nBoalsburg, Pennsylvania, bases its claim on an 1864 gathering of women to mourn those recently killed at Gettysburg. In Carbondale, Illinois, locals claim that they were first, thanks to an 1866 parade led in part by John Logan, who two years later would lead the charge for an official holiday.\n\nThere are two dueling Columbus challengers (one in Mississippi, the other in Georgia) who have battled it out for Memorial Day supremacy for decades.\n\nOnly one town has received the official seal of approval from the U.S. government. 100 years after the town of Waterloo, New York, first celebrated the day on May 5, 1866, by closing its businesses and taking to the streets for the first of many community-wide celebrations, President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation declaring the tiny upstate village the “official” birthplace of Memorial Day.\n\nOn May 5, 1868, General John A. Logan, leader of an organization for Northern Civil War veterans, called for a nationwide day of remembrance later that month. The date of Decoration Day, as he called it, was chosen because it wasn’t the anniversary of any particular battle.\n\nOn the first Decoration Day, Gen. James Garfield made a speech at Arlington National Cemetery, and 5,000 participants decorated the graves of the 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers buried there.\n\nMany Northern states held similar commemorative events and reprised the tradition in subsequent years. By 1890 each one had made Decoration Day an official state holiday.\n\nSouthern states, on the other hand, continued to honor their dead on separate days until after World War I. Southern commemorations were rarely held on one standard day, with observations differing by state and spread out across much of the spring and early summer.\n\nIt’s a tradition that continues today.\n\nNine southern states officially recognize a Confederate Memorial Day, with events held on Confederate President Jefferson Davis’ birthday, the day on which General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson was killed, or to commemorate other symbolic events.\n\nMemorial Day\n\nMemorial Day, as Decoration Day gradually came to be known, originally honored only those lost while fighting in the Civil War. But during World War I the United States found itself embroiled in another major conflict, and the holiday evolved to commemorate American military personnel who died in all wars, including World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nFor decades, Memorial Day continued to be observed on May 30, the date Logan had selected for the first Decoration Day.\n\nBut in 1968 Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as the last Monday in May in order to create a three-day weekend for federal employees; the change went into effect in 1971. The same law also declared Memorial Day a federal holiday.\n\nMemorial Day traditions\n\nCities and towns across the United States host Memorial Day parades each year, often incorporating military personnel and members of veterans’ organizations. Some of the largest parades take place in Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C.\n\nAmericans also observe Memorial Day by visiting cemeteries and memorials. Some people wear a red poppy in remembrance of those fallen in war, a tradition that began with a World War I poem, “In Flanders Field” by John McCrae.\n\nMany people take weekend trips or throw parties and barbecues on the holiday, perhaps because Memorial Day weekend unofficially marks the beginning of summer.\n\nVeterans groups, concerned that more Americans associate the holiday with first long weekend of the summer and not its intended purpose to honor the nation’s war dead, continue to lobby for a return to the May 30 observances.\n\nFor more than 20 years, their cause was championed by decorated World War II veteran and Hawaiian Sen. Daniel Inouye, who until his 2012 death reintroduced legislation in support of the change at the start of every Congressional term.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/14/no-kings-anti-trump-protests-live-updates/84131727007/", "title": "'No Kings' protests: SUV charges protester; rallies largely peaceful", "text": "This story has been updated to include new estimates of protest crowd size.\n\nDemonstrators filled the streets of U.S. cities and towns in coordinated \"No Kings\" events, billed as a \"national day of peaceful protest,\" in the largest outpouring of opposition to Trump's policies since he returned to power in January.\n\nThe mostly calm marches, organized under the theme that no individual is above the law, coincided with the day President Donald Trump hosted a military parade on the streets of the nation's capital.\n\nAt least one demonstration, about 70 miles from Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia, was met with violence when a man intentionally drove an SUV through a crowd of departing protesters, striking at least one person, police said.

He’d be appalled to see what’s happening now. We’re seeing authoritarianism creep in. We’ve seen this before and it doesn’t end well.”\n\nThe rally drew a cross-section of the community − students, veterans, retirees, families and first-time demonstrators, many of whom cited the same issues of militarization, mass deportations and erosion of democratic norms.Bill Bostancic, 99, stood beneath a handmade sign that read “Democracy Takes Work.”“I’ve seen a lot in my lifetime; sometimes too much,” he said. “But I’ve never seen anything like this. If you don’t work at democracy, it slips away.”\n\nLA’s 'No Kings' rally route comes to a peaceful close\n\nAfter a roughly 2-mile protest route, thousands made their way back toward the steps of Los Angeles' City Hall and Grand Park to hydrate, gather and simply stand in solidarity against Trump's mass deportation efforts in the city.\n\nAcross the street from Grand Park — where many people stayed put, recharging and getting some shade in the 80-degree, sunny weather — organizers kept the energy going in front of City Hall steps. A lively crowd, hundreds strong, was standing in the streets when a fitting call and response went up.\n\n\"Whose streets?\" \"Our streets!\"\n\nIsabella and Mark Garcia were among those sardined in the street.

Anticipation rose and rain fell as demonstrators flooded past the perimeter of LOVE Park, waiting for the official start of the march.\n\nThe front lines of the protest made it to the Museum of Art just shy of 1 p.m. with cheers and a chant of “U.S.A.” Helicopters continued overhead, joining the sounds of the march and music coming from numerous speakers attached to the stages, platforms and risers on the museum’s lawn.\n\nThe event began with a performance from local band Trash Boy, before Bishop William J. Barber gave an impassioned speech to the crowd.\n\nHundreds of attendees could be seen leaving Saturday’s rally early, heading down Benjamin Franklin Parkway just after 2 p.m. as speakers continued.\n\nThe rain that began earlier in the day seemed to dampen the mood for some, but not all. Kevin Reilly and Eric Reisman from the Ambler area said they’re happy with how the protest went.\n\n“It was peaceful,” Reisman said. “A smash success.”\n\nReilly’s son’s girlfriend is moving here from India, he said, growing emotional. “She’s really afraid.

Tim Walz called the incident a “politically motivated assassination.”\n\n\"Governor Walz has recommended that we cancel No Kings events across the state of Minnesota because the individual who assassinated a Democratic lawmaker is still at large,\" organizers said in a statement on their website. \"For the safety of all involved, we are cancelling all Minnesota events not already underway.\"\n\nAuthorities found papers with \"No Kings\" written on them in the back seat of the suspect's vehicle, Col. Christina Bogojevic with the Department of Public Safety said.\n\nThere was no evidence of a specific threat to the \"No Kings\" rallies; however, Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said authorities were sharing the information about the papers found so the public remains informed.\n\n'All of you are immigrants': Los Angeles 'No Kings' Rally kicks off\n\nAt City Hall in Los Angeles, sheriff's deputies fanned out at the top of the steps as people began to gather in advance of one of several protests planned across the city.\n\nReggae music, the sound of helicopters overheard and the smell of freshly cooked hot dogs being sold by vendors for $10 a piece greeted arrivals.\n\nAs the crowd quickly swelled to about 1,000 people, hundreds of others gathered around a speaker: Shannon Rivers on a bullhorn. Rivers is a member of the Akimel O'odam (River People) Nation and is an Indigenous Peoples human rights activist.\n\nOther members of the Native American group played drums and some held signs that read, \"No one is illegal on stolen land.\" Los Angeles is the ancestral land of the Tongva People.\n\n\"Stop talking about immigrants,\" Rivers said. \"All of you are immigrants. Everyone one of you. We've accepted you into our territory — sometimes reluctantly, but we've done it. We are here today, we are standing in solidarity.\"\n\nMany among those gathered near City Hall have brought signs with messages including: \"The Only Minority Destroying America Are Billionaires,\" \"L.A. Heat Melts I.C.E.\" and \"United We Stand Against Hate.\"\n\nAnd then there was the sign Victor Ceron carried to the barricade midway up the steps at City Hall and held it high so the sheriff’s deputies fanned out across the top could see it.\n\nIt read: \"Brown Won’t Back Down.\"\n\nCeron, who said he is a 39-year-old, first-generation Mexican American, said he wants the world to see the sign so people know, “We are a resilient people.”\n\nHe said it was his first protest, and he came alone. “But I’m thinking of my parents and my son. He’s the future,” added Ceron, who said he was born and raised in Los Angeles.\n\n– Pamela Avila and Josh Peter\n\nProtests ramp up across California\n\nProtesters are showing up for the planned 9 a.m. Saturday protest at Redding City Hall in Shasta County in Northern California to say, \"We don’t fall for the fear-mongering, we want ICE out of California, and we won’t let our elected officials be attacked,\" said Redding resident Brooke McGowen, who attended similar past protests.\n\nHundreds of people also gathered in the morning for the \"No Kings\" rally in Cathedral City in Southern California's Coachella Valley on Saturday. They lined the street near the Cathedral City Civic Center.\n\nProtesters carried an array of signs that said things like “We Don’t Need A Nepo-Baby King,” “Get the Faux King Out of Our White House,” and “A Woman’s Place is in the Resistance.\" They were chanting “Trump Must Go!”\n\nCoachella Valley residents will also march and cruise from Coachella to Rancho Mirage on Saturday.\n\n– Ani Gasparyan and Jennifer Cortez, Palm Springs Desert Sun and Jessica Skropanic, Redding Record Searchlight\n\nThousands march in 'No Kings' protest in Oklahoma City\n\n“No hate, no fear. Immigrants are welcome here,” marchers chanted in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nCars driving by honked in support, drawing cheers from the marchers. Thunder clapped loudly as the rain became steadier.\n\nJames Neal, 50, of Enid, said he came to Oklahoma City to protest the “rise of authoritarianism in the country and defend the constitution.” A U.S. Navy veteran, he wore a shirt that said, “Not on my Watch.”\n\n– Ray Rivera, The Oklahoman\n\n'No Kings' float joins Columbus Pride march\n\nA “No Kings” march took place June 13 in downtown Columbus, Ohio and Indivisible Central Ohio brought the same themes into its float at the Stonewall Columbus Pride Festival and March on Saturday.\n\nProtestors with the group gathered around a white parade float styled after the White House. “No kings in the White House,” read a banner across it.\n\nPeople carried signs stating, “No kings, no dictators, no billionaires, no bullies”; “We the people means everyone”; and other slogans.\n\nMia Lewis, organizer for Indivisible Central Ohio and associate director of Common Cause, said her group was there to protest because the rights of LGBTQ+ people are under attack by the Trump administration, along with the rights of immigrants, women and refugees.\n\n“We the people do not accept a president who is trying to overthrow our democracy,” Lewis said. “We do not accept that Donald Trump is trying to be a king. … So many things he is doing run counter to our democracy.”\n\n– Bailey Gallion, Cole Behrens, Nathaniel Shuda, Eleanor Kennedy and Nathan Hart, Columbus Dispatch\n\nHundreds gather in Delaware for as 'No Kings' protest\n\nMore than a thousand people marched in Wilmington, Delaware, on the morning of June 14 as part of the \"No Kings\" day gathering.\n\nDemonstrators began organizing before 9 a.m., when the first speakers addressed the crowd. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester was one of the initial speakers, followed by Gov. Matt Meyer. Meyer served as grand marshal as speakers wrapped up and the \"parade\" got underway around 9:20 a.m.\n\nThe governor stirred the crowd by quoting Simon Wiesenthal, an Austrian Holocaust survivor, Nazi hunter and writer:\n\n\"For evil to flourish, for evil to flourish, it only takes one thing for evil to flourish, for evil to flourish,\" Meyer quoted. \"It only requires that good women and men be silenced for evil to flourish; it only requires that good women and men be silent.\"\n\n–Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra, Delaware News Journal\n\n'No Kings' march toward Mar-a-Lago begins\n\nAt exactly 10 a.m., attendees, young and old, migrated from the shade of Phipps Park’s ficus trees to begin their march toward Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach estate. Some chanted into megaphones and others seemed content to nod along.\n\nDaniela Childers, a 31-year-old therapist from West Palm Beach, stood alone among the crowd of demonstrators gathered at the park ahead of the march. She said she’s a generally anxious person who had abstained from protests before, but decided she could no longer watch from the sidelines.\n\n“I’m here at my first protest to basically show dissent to the current administration that I disagree with completely,” she said.\n\n– Hannah Phillips and Valentina Palm, Palm Beach Post\n\nWhere are 'No Kings' protests planned? See the map\n\nThe largest protest effort is expected in Philadelphia. Major protests are also scheduled in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, New York, Phoenix and Los Angeles, while sympathetic protests have cropped up in other countries.\n\nPhiladelphia's 'No Kings' protest set to be largest\n\nThe largest \"No Kings\" protest on June 14 is expected to take place in Philadelphia as a nod to the country's history and to avoid accusations that protesters are opposing the Army parade in the nation's capital, organizers have said.\n\n\"We made that choice to not feed into any narrative that Trump might want that we're counter-protesting him directly or give him the opportunity to crack down on protesters,\" Levin said.\n\nThe Philadelphia protest begins at LOVE Park at the corner of Arch Street & North 15th Street at noon. At 12:30 p.m., the crowd plans to march down the Ben Franklin Parkway to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where several people will speak. It is expected to end at about 3 p.m.\n\nThe Association of the United States Army is also hosting its own celebration for the 250th anniversary of the Army in Philadelphia over three days that started Friday, for which the city closed parts of several roads and altered bus routes.\n\nSherri King woke up at 6 a.m. to head to the Philadelphia protest from her home in Elkton, Maryland.\n\n“I just think it’s important because I’m an American citizen and we have to live by the constitution, and Trump is not obeying the constitution from what I see,” King said while finishing her protest sign in LOVE Park.\n\n“We don’t need no kings in America. We have a democracy,” King said.\n\nSome protests could see bad weather\n\nMuch of the central and eastern parts of the country are expected to see showers and some storms on Saturday, with the chance for severe thunderstorms affecting protests in parts of the northern High Plains states of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Nebraska.\n\nForecasters said flash flooding is a concern in Virginia and North Carolina on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, parts of the West are expecting a hot, dry heat with temperatures up to 110 in the Desert Southwest.

Nationwide more than 500,000 people have RSVP'd to attend one of 1,000 rallies marches or protests organized by a handful of grassroots groups.\n\n\"What April 5 is really about is saying, 'Hey folks, let's all come together in one day and show the power of our voices and ensure our voices are heard about what we're seeing coming out of this administration and to push back on these harms,\" MoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting said.\n\nHunter Dunn, spokesman for one of the groups, called 50501 for 50 states, 50 capitols, one day, said organizers want to bring protests to the people who want to participate, rather than expecting everyone to converge on a handful of large cities.\n\n\"We want to make that space to have those massive protests, but we also want to make sure that you can walk outside your door and start resisting if that's what you need to do. If that's all you can do, we have a place for you,” Dunn said.\n\nHosting organizations include longstanding groups like Indivisible, Women’s March, MoveOn, Working Families Power, and Public Citizen and grassroots groups like 50501 that have formed since Election Day.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. event, expected to be the largest, starts at noon at the Washington Monument. Organizers said they expect it to be much bigger than the People’s March that occurred the weekend before Trump's second inauguration. The protests will be livestreamed here.\n\nThe office of the first lady cited the planned protests Thursday as the reason it moved the White House's annual spring garden tour to Sunday.

Some protests have focused specifically on supporting federal employees, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, Palestinian self-determination or Ukraine, and others have demonstrated against Trump’s agenda generally.\n\nIn February alone, more than 2,085 protests took place nationwide, according to the Crowd Counting Consortium, a joint project of Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut. That's an increase from 937 protests in February 2017, the first full month of the first Trump administration.\n\nMany of the protests in the early months of Trump's first term were much larger than the nation has seen so far in 2025, and that has resulted in less frequent media coverage.\n\nEpting said the majority of protests or people showing up at their member of Congress' town halls have been regular people organizing in their community because they're upset and they don't like what they're seeing and what's happening.\n\n“When you see those things happening, you know there's a movement bubbling up,\" she said. \"We know we're stronger in numbers. Let's take make sure we're all taking action together in one day so that we can tell one concerted story in opposition to the cuts to these critical services.\"\n\nThe volume is the point\n\nRachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of Women’s March, said she's got an eye on the sheer number of protests scheduled, especially in small towns.\n\n“I love hearing about 200 people in Fargo, North Dakota, there were 700 people in Amarillo for a recent march,\" she said. Adding that it takes real political courage \"to stand up in a small town, in a red city, in a red state, in a red region, and to say, 'No. We're here, and we're going to stand up and fight for what's right here in our community.'”\n\nDifferent groups have different goals for the actions, which include marches and protests, she said. Some want to show Democrats that they have the political strength to stand up to Trump or to change Democratic leadership, some want to show Trump and Republicans the size of the opposition they face.\n\n“We're looking for people to come out there support the causes that they that are most passionate to them … and bringing all those causes together in solidarity, so that we can show our government, and we can show the world the American people are not being represented by the government, and show them that in 2026 and 2028 we are going to take our democracy back,” Dunn told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 2017 Women’s March, , which drew millions of women to protests around the country after Trump's first election, was headlined by prominent female politicians and celebrities, but the line-up for Saturday’s march is more focused on hearing from leaders of the organizations, with a few popular politicians thrown in.\n\n\"I think that it's really important for folks to hear from people who understand and live the same problems and really live in the world with them,\" Carmona said. “It's important to understand what people are there for. I don't think people are there to reify other people's power anymore. I think they're looking for their own leadership, and they want to understand how to exercise that.

Walking down the square's gently sloping granite stair steps, they entered a space that's been sacred to U.S. labor organizing.\n\nOn the first Monday in September 1882, the first Labor Day parade was held at Union Square − which gets its name from being the meeting point of major thoroughfares. That first parade was such a success it caused more people across the U.S. to pay attention to workers' rights, historians say, and in 1894, President Grover Cleveland made Labor Day a national holiday.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any place that’s been more significant to labor organizing in the United States than Union Square,\" said Andrew Berman, executive director of Village Preservation, which works to protect the history of neighborhoods surrounding Union Square.\n\nMore so than now, the Manhattan communities around Union Square were populated by working class immigrants, said Mary Anne Trasciatti, director of the Labor Studies program at Hofstra University on Long Island. It's also significant the first Labor Day parade was in New York City, a major player in global business, she said. The day of the first parade in 1882, it was like the workers \"owned the streets,\" she said.\n\n\"New York is a city of money, it's a city in which financial interests dominate, it's the head of finance for the world,\" Trasciatti told USA TODAY. \"To have a day where working class people are filling the streets together, that's really a powerful statement.\"\n\nWhere is Union Square?\n\nUnion Square is dozens of blocks south of Central Park, but the plaza known for workers' rights is also quite centrally located, sitting just north of what's considered lower Manhattan. Of the 12 numbered avenues running north-south through Manhattan, Union Square falls between 5th Avenue and 4th Avenue, which unites with another major street, Broadway, running diagonally out of the square's southeast and northwest corners. The park is bordered by 14th Street to the south and 17th Street to the north.\n\n\"Union Square was such a crossroads, in between east and west, uptown and downtown,\" said Lara Vapnek, a history professor at St. John's University in Queens. \"There's also all these transport connections, and it's this open space that has room for workers to gather.\"\n\nOn a recent Friday morning, Nadia Arnett sat on a stair step facing 14th Street, enjoying a breakfast pastry. She said it's always been important for workers to get the pay they deserve, especially Black Americans, who for hundreds of years were enslaved, without any income.\n\n\"That's the point of Labor Day in this country, you're supposed to get paid for your work,\" Arnett, 46, told USA TODAY.\n\nNot far away, Johnny Marrero sat in repose while playing music from a wireless speaker. Marrero, 63, said he was a porter who worked overnight cleaning Manhattan restaurants his whole life before getting injured and undergoing arm and abdominal surgeries. Now, he said, he's unable to work. At Union Square, he's able to focus on the positive, he said.\n\n\"I like seeing people live and move about, I play positive music so hopefully people that walk by will feel it,\" Marrero said. \"I'm just focusing on being grateful, which it's taken me my whole life to realize,\" he said, adding he's celebrating Labor Day at a barbeque with friends.\n\nA large open space, Union Square has paved walkways and some green space, while the southern portion is dominated by a massive brick plaza. There are few places to sit in the large bottom portion of the park, except on a handful of stair steps.\n\nOn Friday, as commuters hurried on their way to the N, Q and L subways lines, other New Yorkers ruffled through pharmacy shopping bags, while some begged for money or collected aluminum cans to exchange for cash at recycling centers. More than 100 people gathered in the space, but it wasn't crowded because of the square's expansiveness.\n\nThat same architecture allowed about 10,000 marchers and more than 20,000 spectators to gather during the first Labor Day parade, said Kimberly Phillips-Fein, a history professor at Columbia University.\n\n\"You can just get a lot more people into Union Square,\" Phillips-Fein said. \"The bottom half of Union Square, it's an open public space that just melts right into the streets in a distinctive way.\"\n\n1800s Union Square was working class\n\nIn 1882, there were more places for working class people to gather around Union Square, like in automat restaurants, a precursor to fast food, where a customer could put coins into a slot to purchase a meal, said Joshua Freeman, an emeritus history professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center.\n\n\"The idea that you'd find your colleagues by going to a cafeteria off of Union Square is very quaint now because you can just reach them on Facebook or something,\" Freeman told USA TODAY. \"We don't quite have physical equivalents to these kinds of centers that we once did.\"\n\nThere were also cheap cinemas and affordable department stores for the working class along 14th Street, which was referred to as the \"Poor Man's Fifth Avenue,\" Berman said.\n\nUnion Square's role as a major center working class hub lent itself to worker solidarity. Different labor unions came together to advocate for important rights like an 8-hour workday, an end to child labor and equal pay for women, said Vapnek.\n\n\"People don't necessarily realize there were basically no labor laws in the 1880s,\" Vapnek said. \"There was no legislation limiting the number of hours that people could work, so it's really up to workers to do it.\"\n\nFor long after the first Labor Day parade, Union Square and its surrounding neighborhoods remained \"the center of leftist and progressive movements and labor organizing in New York City,\" which was \"probably the most impactful in the country,\" said Berman, noting the Communist Party of America was headquartered off of Union Square on 13th Street for much of the 20th century before moving to 23rd Street.\n\nThroughout the entire 20th century and much of the 21st, Union Square continued to be a site of mass protests and organizing, Phillips-Fein said, pointing to New York's main 9/11 memorial, demonstrations opposing wars in the Middle East, and Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\nWhat was the first Labor Day parade like?\n\nBecause the first Labor Day parade was held before the national holiday was enacted, the approximately 10,000 workers walked off the job to participate, Freeman said.\n\n\"You've got to remember, it was not on a weekend. So for workers to not go to work, it was a risky thing,\" Freeman said.\n\nHeld in early September, the workers marching that day were making a statement together in warm, end-of-summer weather, and they had brass bands filling the music with air, said Trasciatti. Thousands of unionized men representing different trades like carpentry and construction were organized behind banners representing their labor unions, she said.\n\n\"Places like Union Square where working people gathered, and can still gather, to hear speakers and to march, that's where you feel solidarity,\" Trasciatti said. \"It's where these abstract words like solidarity are directly experienced.\"\n\nThe worker unity and pride on display influenced the way the day was marked later in the U.S., Freeman said.\n\n“It was considered such a big success that it established the idea that it should be a workers’ holiday,\" Freeman said.\n\nNYC Labor Day parade 2024\n\nIn recent history, the New York City Labor Day Parade marches down 5th Avenue without stopping at Union Square. But the Central Labor Council, which was called the Central Labor Union in 1882, is still the main organizer of the event, said Trasciatti, who will be joining with the Triangle Fire Memorial, a group created to raise awareness about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, in which 146 garment workers, mostly young women, died in Manhattan after factory owners locked fire escape doors.\n\nThis year, the New York City Labor Day Parade will be held on Saturday, Sept. 7 and the theme is \"All workers, many voices, one fight.\"\n\n\"In many ways it's a very American theme, like 'E pluribus unum,' which means, 'out of many, one,\" Trasciatti said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/john-carlisle/2025/05/27/hamtramck-michigan-wiki-history-immigration/78509953007/", "title": "How Hamtramck, a small town within Detroit, became America's first ...", "text": "By John Carlisle. Visuals by Ryan Garza\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nAI-assisted summary Columnist John Carlisle and photojournalist Ryan Garza spent a year exploring the cultural evolution of Hamtramck.\n\nHamtramck, a town of about 2 square miles, sits like an island in the middle of Detroit.\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the man reached up and pulled away a scarlet cloth, revealing unto the people a sign.\n\nIt was a cold day, late in winter. Maybe a hundred people — almost all of them men — had gathered on a grassy street corner lot in Hamtramck, a city of 2 square miles that sits like an island in the middle of Detroit. Among them were local businessmen, elected officials, religious leaders and a couple of stray hipsters watching tentatively from the back of the crowd as one dignitary after another took their turn at the microphone.\n\nThey were here to make history by changing it.\n\nThe nation’s first and only all-Muslim City Council had just voted to rename Holbrook Avenue — one of Hamtramck’s main arteries — Palestine Avenue, in reaction to the Israel-Hamas war, then in its fourth month. The road was originally named after Dewitt Holbrook, a 19th-Century lawyer who owned a farm not far from this very spot. The name had stuck for about 125 years. Until this day.\n\nThis rechristening was an apt symbol of the dramatic changes that have recently taken place here. For a century, Hamtramck was known as “Little Poland” for being so uniformly Polish and Catholic that Pope John Paul II himself once made a stop here back in 1987. Even as late as 1970, Poles still were almost 90% of the population, enough to sustain dozens of Polish grocers, bakeries, churches and social clubs.\n\nBut by 1990, according to city officials and historical experts, the number of Polish residents had dropped to 45% as many of them moved to the sprawling suburbs. By 2000, it was maybe 25%. Now, it’s pegged at barely 10% of the roughly 28,000 people who live here, officials say.\n\nTwo square miles: The evolution of Hamtramck\n\nIn their place came waves of Bangladeshi and Yemeni immigrants who swiftly made this America’s first majority Muslim city. The Poles were reduced to an asterisk, strangers in a suddenly strange land where women now walked the streets robed from head to toe in black niqabs, where the signs on the storefronts were now written in scripts foreign to them, where schools replaced Easter vacation with time off at the end of Ramadan, and where the sound of the Islamic call to prayer now competed with the tones of church bells.\n\nA city that once had more bars per capita than any other place in the country was now dominated by a culture that forbids alcohol. What was a hot spot of artists and musicians known for a liberal acceptance of eccentricities and differences now drew international attention when the Muslim city council voted to ban the gay pride flag from city properties. And what had been a quiet, working-class town suddenly became internationally famous as an example of what sudden demographic change looks like.\n\nHamtramck has the highest percentage of immigrants anywhere in Michigan, the biggest concentration of Bangladeshi immigrants in the state and the second-highest percentage of Arab residents after Dearborn. According to Census data, more than 40% of the city is foreign-born and almost 70% of its residents are Muslim, including the mayor, the police chief and the entire city council, whose members all are men. Signs at City Hall are presented in English, Arabic and Bengali. “The World in Two Square Miles” the city’s slogan declares.\n\nThere’s a constant churn of immigrants arriving and leaving, so a precise ethnic breakdown of Hamtramck is difficult to peg, particularly since Census data doesn't distinguish ethnic breakdowns. Best estimates put the city’s Yemeni population at more than 30% and growing, the Bangladeshis at about 25% and holding steady, Black people at scarcely 10% and shrinking, and Polish people at even less. A scattering of others makes up the rest, including Bosnians, Albanians and a surge of Ukrainians now flooding into the same city their ancestors flocked to more than a century ago, when they likewise were fleeing the Russians.\n\nAll over town there are signs of a new culture erasing the old.\n\nThe long-standing Family Donut Shop has become the Taj Al-Yemen restaurant, which keeps a token selection of doughnuts at the front counter under glass, like a culinary enclave within the Middle Eastern eatery.\n\nKrakus Polish Restaurant is now Sylhet Café, a Bengali eatery that grows its ingredients in a garden on the former Buick auto dealership lot next door.\n\nStan’s Grocery, which sold Polish staples such as kishka, paczki and pierogi, went out of business and was soon reborn as Royal Mart, a Bangladeshi grocer offering paratha, samosas and sliced satkora fruit.\n\nAnd now, the very name of a main street was being changed to reflect not just the culture of the newcomers, but also the politics they brought with them.\n\nCouncilman Khalil Refai — who immigrated from Yemen as a child, whose election two years before solidified the Muslim majority on the council and who sponsored the measure to change the name of this road — climbed a ladder and ceremoniously removed the cloth that covered the new sign, which was installed atop the old one.\n\nThe crowd below him applauded at the sight of the new name. It wasn’t an official change on maps, only an honorary designation. But the message was clear.\n\nThings are now different here.\n\n“There is power to renaming things,” declared Imam Imran Salha of the Islamic Center of Detroit as he stood at the podium, pointing up to the sign. “What significance is there to ‘Holbrook’? There’s nothing special about ‘Holbrook.’ ”\n\nGreg Kowalski turned the steering wheel and rounded the corner at the stoplight.\n\n“This is Holbrook Avenue,” said the 74-year-old executive director of the Hamtramck Historical Museum. He was giving a driving tour of his hometown, one of his many functions as its unofficial historian. “It was at the center of the village. It’s only a few blocks away from St. Florian church, and that was a real centerpiece of Hamtramck. And Holbrook is where the pope spoke when he came here, in the parking lot right there. So it’s always been the center of a lot of activities. It’s very significant.”\n\nKowalski was born in Hamtramck, spent his life here, wrote 11 books about his hometown; and when he dies, he wants his ashes scattered on the railroad tracks at the edge of town for their role in bringing so many immigrants here a century ago. Hamtramck, he often says, was built by immigration more than almost any other place in America. And this city became his passion.\n\n“I learned everything I could, like what kind of trees there are. I learned the sewers — behind us there’s a 1910 sewer, down the street there’s a 1909 sewer. I learned the alleys — when were they put in, when were they repaved. I made it my point to learn every single thing about Hamtramck.”\n\nAnd one thing he learned is that this isn’t the first time newcomers to town have put new names on streets like Holbrook. “When the Poles came here, they started renaming things, too,” he said. “You can imagine the very same criticism you are hearing today was being leveled back then.”\n\nIt was founded as a township in 1798 and named after Jean Francoise Hamtramck, a French-Canadian immigrant who served in the American army, became a Revolutionary War hero and who’s now buried in a public park after the city disinterred him in 1962 from Detroit and brought his remains here, granting him the lone gravesite in town.\n\nHamtramck once sprawled from the northern suburbs to the Detroit River, but fast-growing Detroit began annexing huge chunks of it until only a small core village, surrounded by Detroit on all sides, was all that remained. Local leaders, determined to resist, held an election during the 1920s in which residents voted to become a city, making it nearly impossible by state law for Detroit to finish the job.\n\nThe area was rural farmland populated by German immigrants until the Dodge brothers opened a massive auto factory on the south side of town in 1910 and offered thousands of jobs to anyone who would move there. Somehow the word reached Poland first, and, within a decade, Hamtramck’s population exploded from 3,500 people to 48,000, most of them Poles. They were the first wave of immigrants to displace a previous group in town. They wouldn’t be the last.\n\nFrom the start, the city was an outlier.\n\nIt refused to be swallowed by its larger, more powerful neighbor, even as several other townships and villages in the region were unable to resist.\n\nIt didn’t just ignore Prohibition, it openly defied it. “There were more places to drink here during Prohibition than after,” Kowalski said. At one point there were 200 bars here. In a mere 2 square miles.\n\nAnd its schools, government and neighborhoods were integrated decades before those of the surrounding communities. The Polish immigrants in the region were initially treated so terribly, Kowalski said, that once they took power, they welcomed everyone else to town — Ukrainians, Albanians, Bosnians and especially Black people.\n\n“We were treated the second worst,” Kowalski said. “The only people considered below us were the Black people. So when they came to Hamtramck, they weren’t treated like they were in other places. That’s why Hamtramck was so welcoming.” The city elected the first Black leaders of the region, hired the first Black police officers and detectives, employed the first Black city workers and teachers.\n\n“When I grew up, our street — I think every street — was mixed,” said Vera Burk, 97, who still lives in the house her father built when he moved from the South seeking work along with other Black families in the early 1920s. “It was Polish, Blacks, and my good friend across the street was Ukrainian, and all of us on this street was like family. Everybody got along ‘cause that’s the way we were raised here. If they don’t bother you, don’t bother them.”\n\nOh, you should have seen it back then, the old-timers say. A thriving shopping district. A downtown that glowed at night. Clean-swept alleys. Cathedral churches. Friendly neighbors. And the massive auto plant whose jobs made it all possible.\n\nThen the neighbors grew old and died, their kids moved to newer suburbs, and, by the ‘70s and ‘80s, the city was in decline. The Dodge Main plant closed in 1980, the American Axle plant followed in 2009, and there went thousands of local jobs.\n\nIt became a gritty destination for artists and musicians seeking cheap housing and a safe alternative to a then crime-plagued Detroit. For years, it’s been the site of the Blowout, a weekend festival featuring hundreds of local garage bands playing in dozens of the city’s bars. It became the home of the Detroit City FC soccer team, which draws huge crowds to town on game days. It remains the site of Paczki Day, the local, Polish version of Fat Tuesday on the day before Lent, featuring a doughnut-fueled bar crawl that’s become a local tradition. And it still hosts the annual Hamtramck Labor Day Festival, a massive, three-day concert, carnival and food extravaganza that draws tens of thousands of visitors.\n\nBut the city also declined into economic disaster, with ballooning pension obligations and a large annual budget deficit, which twice prompted the state to appoint an emergency financial manager to run things. For years, its elections came under the watchful eye of the U.S. Department of Justice after accusations of voter intimidation against recent immigrants. The school district was the target of a number of lawsuits by former employees. And more than 40% of the city currently lives in poverty, according to Census data.\n\nStill, Hamtramck was better than Bangladesh for the Bengalis who began arriving here in the 1980s and resurrected the city’s worst neighborhoods on the eastern border with Detroit. It was far better than their impoverished homeland for the Yemenis who joined them in droves and boosted the city’s population by more than a quarter in just a decade. And it’s been a lifesaver for the recent wave of Ukrainians and Afghans fleeing their battle-ravaged homelands. Add a smattering of immigrants from dozens of other nationalities who now live here in crowded contrast, and Hamtramck now essentially is — for better or worse — the world in two square miles.\n\n“The dynamics here are really amazing,” Kowalski said. He turned his car down Conant, unofficially renamed Bangladesh Avenue long ago for its profusion of Bengali storefronts. “Look at the people walking. You’ll see turbans, you’ll see babushkas, you’ll see hijabs, everything. This town is exploding, the population is rising, we’re getting everybody here. And let me tell you, it’s wonderful to see. And 99% of the people I encounter are really nice, good, solid people.”\n\nYet not everyone thinks the changes are so great.\n\nFrom the outset, some residents worried that the new Muslim majority would try to impose their strict religious and cultural beliefs on city government as they gained power. And elected officials sometimes gave fuel to those fears.\n\nFirst came the approval in 2004 of the Islamic call to prayer five times a day, which blares out from a number of mosques in town, sometimes without regard to volume restrictions. That brought contentious debates, but residents ultimately sanctioned the council's approval in a close vote.\n\nThen came a successful voter drive in 2008, led by a Muslim mayoral candidate, to overturn the city’s human rights ordinance, which he said would lead to trans pedophilia and bestiality.\n\nThat was later followed by a city council vote in 2023 to permit halal animal slaughter on residential property, and suddenly people said they were seeing stray sheep and ducks running through neighborhoods as if on the lam. That vote drew an uproar from animal rights organizations and their supporters.\n\nThat was followed by a gay pride flag ban passed by the city council that same year, which brought condemnation from local political leaders, national LGBTQ+ organizations and unflattering coverage by international news crews.\n\nThrow in the sight of women shrouded in public; of separate Islamic spaces for men and women; of insular communities where English isn’t spoken; and some long-time residents grumbled that the newcomers weren’t making efforts to assimilate, to adapt to their surroundings. To become \"American.\"\n\nRefai admits that his countrymen sometimes cling hard to their traditions. “Yemenis are more into their culture and their religion than people who come from other countries,” said the 39-year-old first-term councilman. “People that visit Hamtramck from other states like Texas come here and they see how they dress here, how is the vibe here, they say, ‘How is this America? It’s like back home, but upgraded.’ ”\n\nMayor Amer Ghalib, a Yemeni immigrant who became the city’s first Muslim mayor three years ago, argues that the newcomers have a right to their cultural choices like any other American citizens.\n\n“It’s how they like to dress, especially in a community that has a lot of Yemenis,” said the 45-year-old, sitting in his city office. A Yemeni ceremonial dagger sat to the side; behind him stood an American flag. “A lot of people that I know, they don’t want their women to be exposed to us or to see them. That’s how it is back home. So wherever they go, they let them cover. It’s a cultural thing. And just like you want us to respect whatever lifestyle you have, you have to respect others and the way they dress.”\n\nBut some longtime residents bristle when those cultural traditions clash with modern Western social norms, especially when it comes to the role of women. Catrina Stackpoole, a progressive former city council member who’s suing the city over the council’s pride flag ban, hopes those restrictive customs will fade as the children of immigrants become more assimilated.\n\n“I have total faith in the next generation of young people, and I know the young Muslim kids are going to break out of this conservative bullshit,” the 71-year-old said. “It’ll only be a matter of time. I already see Yemeni kids playing air guitar in the middle of the Hamtramck festival. The Bengali girls are taking American clothes to the high school and changing at school. It was the same thing I did. I was a hippie and my mom and dad would not let me wear bell-bottoms, so I took the bell-bottoms to school and I put them on there. And the Bengali girls are taking their traditional dress clothes off and putting on jeans and a T-shirt.”\n\nKowalski has heard people criticize the newcomers for being slow to adapt. They used to do that about the Poles a century ago, he said. The first generation usually sticks to its ways. But then, as now, he believes, their kids are the ones who will inevitably bring about that change.\n\n“The children are the real bridge to breaking through cultural lines,” he said. “They go to school together, you’ll see them on the streets playing together, you’ll see mixed groups of kids playing together, and that’s really the most important thing because they carry that home. They’re the future. They have one foot in each world — the old country and the new country — and they understand they’re walking a very careful line, because they’re glued to the old country and the old traditions whether they want to be or not. And yet, they’re changing.”\n\nHamtramck might be the most conflicted small town in the country. By all accounts, it’s also one of the most civil.\n\n“People are friendly here, even those who we disagree with,” Ghalib said. “I’ve never seen any violent actions from anyone. We can disagree on stuff, but let’s be peaceful.”\n\nAs immigrants first began flooding the town a century ago to work in the auto plant, tens of thousands of two-story duplexes were hastily built, barely 8 feet apart, on 30-foot lots to cram all the newcomers into the city’s 2 square miles. It makes Hamtramck the most densely populated city in Michigan to this day. And it forces people to develop an intimate tolerance of others.\n\n“Hamtramck has always been a very special, very welcoming place,” said Emily Jane Wood, 43, a local artist known for her distinct paintings of city street life. “I feel like living so closely on top of each other, that with that intense physical space there’s kind of an inverse mental space. You try to give people a wide berth.”\n\n“In general daily communication, people are very pleasant, very warm,” said Zlatan Sadikovic, 65, the owner of Oloman Café, who came here from Bosnia three decades ago. “I don’t speak their language, they don’t speak my language. But I wave, they wave and smile. It’s just like a small village type of living. Everybody lives really in harmony. There’s no, like, tension of any kind.”\n\nUnlike many other cities that are dense with immigrants, Hamtramck isn’t split into strict enclaves. Although the Bengalis loosely dominate the northeast side of the city and many of the Yemenis are clustered in the south, most of the neighborhoods are an improbable jumble of streets where no two neighbors are alike.\n\n“The street where we live, we got white, Black, Yemeni, Bengali; everybody living very peacefully,” said resident Anwar Hassan, 46, the owner of Remas Restaurant, which serves dishes from Yemen, his homeland. “We go to the neighbors, the non-Muslims, and we give them Ramadan dishes. Even, sometimes during holidays, we will give gifts to the kids, like at Christmas. Everybody respects each other at Christmas, at New Year’s. We celebrate, not religiously, but they still celebrate the vibe, the fireworks, the joy. People are being off for a few days and everybody has a good time.”\n\nHe sat in a booth in his restaurant, looking out of the window. An American flag flew high on a pole along the street. Walking beneath it were Yemeni women dressed in black niqabs, a long garment worn by observant Muslim women covering everything but their eyes. Then a pair of white guys in hipster wear. Here came Bengali women swathed in pastel fabrics. Here were kids walking home from school in blended groups. It was the city in distillation, presented on parade. The groups to which they belonged often sniped on social media and at public meetings. But here, on the street as individuals, all of them politely gave each other space when they passed. And a few even smiled to one another as they went by.\n\n“In the public arena, people will tear each other apart,” said Charles Sercombe, the last remaining reporter at the town’s last newspaper, the Hamtramck Review. “But in the neighborhoods, everyone usually gets along. It’s a matter of survival. You hear everything — the arguments, the lovemaking, because they’re living on top of each other. You get along with your Bangladeshi neighbor, with your Yemeni neighbors; there’s no clash there. Usually your neighbors are really fascinating to get to know. It’s like an oasis, and that’s what makes the city so charming. Why can’t it be like this everywhere, you know?”\n\nJohn Carlisle writes about Michigan.

It also came on the same day that two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot - with one killed alongside her husband - in a pair of politically-motivated attacks from a gunman still on the loose. Both lawmakers were members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nBack in Washington, it was not immediately clear how many people attended the event at the National Mall, which was the first military parade in the nation’s capital since the end of the Gulf War in 1991. But it appeared to be vastly fewer than the 200,000 who had been expected, perhaps a result of the threat of rain looming in the evening forecast.\n\nThe parade, which was projected to cost $40 million in taxpayer dollars, started 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. A 21-gun salute and a performance of “Hail to the Chief” welcomed the president and first lady before the parade began with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, depicting the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n\nOn stage, Trump was also joined by Vice President JD Vance, members of his Cabinet including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Marjorie Taylore Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nMassive fireworks display caps military parade\n\nA massive fireworks display over the National Mall concluded Trump’s military parade as the president and first lady watched from their stage.\n\nSpeakers hailing the virtues of U.S. soldiers played over loudspeakers as the fireworks blasted from near the Washington Monument – mimicking the city’s Fourth of July celebration that will comes in less than one month.\n\nThe soundtrack for the fireworks also included several American anthems including “America the Beautiful.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump hails ‘fiercest and bravest fighting force’ at military parade\n\nTrump hailed the U.S. Army as the “fiercest and bravest fighting force ever to stride the face of the earth” and commended soldiers who have fought and died for the country in patriotic-themed remarks after the parade concluded.\n\n“The Army keeps us free to make us strong. And tonight, you have all American very proud,” Trump said in a seven-minute speech. “Every other country celebrates their victories. It’s about time America did, too.”\n\nTrump traced U.S. military operations from the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, and from World War I and II into the modern times.\n\n“Our soldiers never give up, never surrender and never give up. They fight, fight, fight,” he said, echoing what became one of his slogans after he escaped an assassination attempt in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump said there is “no earthly force more powerful than” an Army solider, before pointing to the sacrifices of the army. “Our soldiers have poured their blood out by the bucket load.”\n\n“Thanks to their extraordinary service and devotion, 250 years later, America stands tall, America stands proud, and America stands free,” he said. “We're the hottest country in the world right now. Our country will soon be greater and stronger than ever before.”\n\nVice President JD Vance noted June 14 is also his wedding anniversary during his remarks introducing Trump. After finishing his speech, Trump and Melania Trump were handed a folded American flag by an officer before singer Lee Greenwood performed “God Bless the USA.” A fireworks display in front of the Washington Monument then erupted.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I love you, honey’: VP Vance celebrates wedding anniversary at parade\n\nNot only did the military parade fall on Trump’s birthday. It also coincided with Vice President JD Vance’s 11th wedding anniversary with second lady Usha Vance.\n\n“Happy birthday, Mr. President,” Vance said as he introduced Trump before the president’s remarks. “But I would get in trouble if I didn’t mention that it’s also my wedding anniversary. And so, to my lovely wife: I love you, honey.”\n\nDirecting his comment to the U.S. soldiers, Vance said the country is proud of them.\n\n“The way that we honor and respect you is, No. 1: We never ask you to go to war unless you absolutely have to,” Vance said. “And No. 2, when we do ask you to go to war, we give you the weapons and the support needed to kick the hell out of the enemy and come back home safely.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nDC workers prepare for cleanup\n\nAs parade crowds begin to disperse, D.C. government workers are already preparing to pick up the mess. Bright orange street sweepers and trash trucks sat waiting on 14th Street NW.\n\nEric Blalock, one of the sweeper operators, said the litter from thousands of parade attendees will be cleaned up by 5 am.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\n‘Have a great life’: Trump presides over Army reenlistment ceremony\n\nAs the parade portion of the festivities concluded, Trump presided over a reenlistment ceremony for hundreds of military members recommitting themselves to service in the U.S. Army.\n\nTrump read their oaths aloud, and the soldiers repeated his words.\n\n“Welcome to the United States Army and have a great life,” Trump said after the ceremony concluded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nHowitzer cannons, Abrams tanks make their way to Trump’s stage\n\nMore than an hour into the parade, the U.S. Army began to show off some of its modern equipment including portable howitzer cannons and M1 Abrams Tanks.\n\nBoth were used extensively in the Gulf War.\n\nMetallica’s “Enter Sandman” played over the loudspeakers as the machinery made its way in front of Trump’s stage.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWhy did people attend the military parade?\n\nParade attendees came out for a variety of reasons — some said they were there for Trump, some to support the military, and others said they just wanted to see the spectacle.\n\nJoe Cook, a 33-year-old self described American history buff, traveled from Baltimore to see what he called a “moving museum” of old military aircraft’s and vehicles.\n\nHe didn’t care that the parade fell on Trump’s birthday and hoped, if anything, it would make the display more spectacular.\n\n“You know him, he lathers everything in gold,” Cook said.\n\n- Karissa Waddick\n\nClassic rock anthems blare over military parade\n\nClassic rock anthems provided the soundtrack of the military parade as the event shifted to modern tanks and equipment used during the war on terror.\n\nAmong the hits blaring on the speakers included Heart’s “Barracuda,” ACDC’s “Thunderstruck,” Van Hallen’s “Jump” and Led Zeppelin’s “Good Times Bad Times.” Members of Led Zeppelin, ironically, are from Great Britain.\n\nSome of the soldiers peaking out of their tanks pumped their fists to the music.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTanks roll by president as Gulf War, war on terror recognized\n\nSoldiers dressed in Gulf War-era uniforms marched by the president in a display that also included military tanks instrumental in the war to liberate Kuwait.\n\nThe tanks were part of the Desert Storm operation led by President George H.W. Bush in 1991.\n\nSoldiers from the global war on terror following the 9/11 terrorist attacks - which included military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan - were showcased next. The parade included a tank from that period of warfare.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCryptocurrency company Coinbase announced as a parade sponsor\n\nA narrator for the parade announced the cryptocurrency exchange company Coinbase as a sponsor of the parade, which has included soldiers from all military eras honoring the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army\n\nTrump has developed a cozy relationship with the crypto industry - and his latest financial disclosure form released June 13 showed its also made him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nIn May, Trump hosted about 220 investors who plowed a combined $148 million into his crypto venture. The dinner was a reward for making the leaderboard in a contest to be among the top purchasers of the $TRUMP meme coin, a type of cryptocurrency.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nSoldiers from World War I and II march by Trump\n\nTrump watched and saluted as military members depicting soldiers from World War I and later World War II made their way past his stage.\n\nDressed in uniforms from those eras, some waved at the president and his guests as they marched by.\n\nAmong the troops showcased were the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, whose troops played an instrumental role in the Normandy landings during World War II, and the 101st Airborne Division based in Fort Campbell Kentucky.\n\nMore than 6,000 army soldiers are expected to march in the parade.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nWeather update: Light rain\n\nLight rain started to fall on the parade as soldiers in World War I-uniform marched past Trump.\n\nA B-25 bomber flew over the mall ahead of the World War II contingent.\n\nArmy spokesman Steve Warren said the weather, so far, wasn’t a problem.\n\n“There are more than 1,000 paratroopers here today. When it rains, most paratroopers look up at the sky and say ‘is that all you got?’”\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nFife and drum corps, Golden Knights perform for Trump\n\nThe first military members to perform in front of Trump’s stage was the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, a group that depicts the uniforms and instruments used by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n\nNext, several parachutes from the Golden Knights Parachute team jumped from planes with their equipment.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCrowd sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to Trump as military parade begins\n\nTwo military tanks are positioned in front of the stage where Trump, Cabinet members and other top allies are watching. The White House is in the backdrop.\n\nSome in the crowd started singing happy birthday to the president after Trump arrived on stage with first lady Melania Trump.\n\nA short video ahead of the parade chronicled the history of the U.S. Army beginning with its role in the Revolutionary Army that gave the United States its freedom.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nParade-goers unworried about early start\n\nThousands of people still zig-zagged Constitution Avenue waiting in line to get into the parade viewing area as the event began.\n\nElijah Donello, 20, said he has waited for more than an hour and isn’t worried about the parade starting early. “We’ll be in position by the time it gets here,” he said.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump arrives for the parade earlier than scheduled\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrived at his viewing stand to watch the parade at 5:43 p.m. ET, about a half hour earlier than originally scheduled as evening rain and thunderstorms loom in the forecast.\n\nTrump’s appearance suggests the parade will get underway earlier than the original 6:30 p.m. ET start time, perhaps to avoid the chance of lightning that could disrupt the event.\n\nTrump will watch the parade next to some of his Cabinet members, Republican lawmakers and other top allies.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nTrump Cabinet members, allies assemble to watch parade with president\n\nMuch of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, Republican lawmakers and other top Trump allies have assembled for the president’s military parade that will mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army on Trump’s 79th birthday.\n\nThose situated in a viewing stand where Trump will watch the parade include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins and White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought.\n\nAlso watching from the stand are Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylore Greene of Georgia, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, Maria Salazar of Florida, Rich McCormick of Georgia, singer Lee Greenwood (performer of “God Bless the USA,” a Trump favorite) and Dana White House, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\n- Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nProtesters and Trump supporters bicker along parade line\n\nAnti-Trump protesters milled, for the most part quietly, along the perimeter of the parade line, though at times they clashed with the presidents supporters.\n\nOne man asked the protesters how much they were being paid.\n\nPaul Williams, 58, yelled back “freedom is free.”\n\nA school teacher from Silver Spring, Maryland, Williams said military parades in the U.S. aren’t “unprecedented” but he is worried about the “atmosphere” of this one, and how much it could cost the federal government.\n\n“I think it's just inappropriate to be celebrating,” he said.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nArmy spokesman on weather forecast: 'This parade will happen'\n\nThe Army’s daylong festival on the National Mall, celebrating its 250th anniversary, came off without a hitch, Army spokesman Steve Warren said.\n\nThe weather, though muggy, cooperated for events like fitness challenges.\n\n“The festival has been a great success,\" Warren said \"People from all walks of life spent the day connecting with soldiers and learning about America’s Army. The parade will be icing on the Army’s birthday cake.\"\n\nPerhaps.\n\nRain and possible thunderstorms crept toward Washington from the west late Saturday afternoon.\n\n“The Army doesn’t have any concerns about the weather,\" Warren said. \"This parade will happen.\"\n\nIf the weather turns nasty, the Army could modify or cancel flyovers by aircraft.\n\n\"But the parade is a go,\" Warren said.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nParade goers line up for blocks\n\nThe line to get into the parade extends multiple city blocks, stretching around the Smithsonian Museum of American History, and then looping back into the street.\n\nVendors are wheeling carts along the road, selling hats, T-shirts and Spongebob Squarepants Popsicles.\n\nThose waiting say the line has moved quickly. Standing near the front, waving a red fan, Chelsea Monk, 34, said she had only waited about five minutes.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWhite House protesters disperse\n\nThe demonstrators outside the White House are dispersing after more than an hour of protesting. Hundreds are headed home, to the metro, and back to their hotels.\n\nLeo Pargo, one of the event’s organizers, said they have no plans to protest the parade beginning at 6:30 p.m.\n\n—Rachel Barber\n\nProtest signs outside the White House\n\nThough the demonstration outside the White House is not officially a “No Kings” protest, several attendees have written the slogan on their signs.\n\nOther signs include “Due process is for everyone,” “Immigrants make America great,” and “Those who ban history want to repeat it.”\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nRefuse Fascism’ demonstration begins in D.C.\n\nThere weren’t any ‘No Kings’ protests originally scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C. during Trump’s military parade but reports early Saturday afternoon show a small demonstration beginning to form.\n\nA group called “Refuse Fascism” started assembling in Logan Circle with about 500 people reportedly marching to Lafayette Park just in front of the White House.\n\n“Fascist America – We say no! Now’s the time for Trump to go,” the crowd chanted, according to the NBC affiliate in Washington.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMAGA merch for sale\n\nAbout a block from the festival, local vendors are selling “Make America Great Again” red baseball caps and white cowboy hats.\n\nTrump shirts are for sale including one that depicts the president in front of the White House and reads “daddy’s home.”\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nThe sun is out in Washington\n\nAlthough potential showers and thunderstorms are expected Saturday evening, it’s a sunny and humid 82 degrees in Washington as of 2:30 p.m.\n\nTrash cans at the National Mall are overflowing with water cups as attendees heat up and apply sunscreen.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\nWho sponsored the festivities?\n\nSigns around the festival list several companies as sponsors of the event.\n\nAmong them are Walmart, Lockheed Martin, and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon Technologies.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nMusic on the main stage\n\nCountry music artist Noah Hicks took the main stage to perform several songs, including his yet to be released single “Small Town Does.”\n\nNearby, families play Connect Four, cornhole and flag football on the grass.\n\n- Rachel Barber\n\nLast military parade in D.C. was 1991\n\nSupporters say it’s a much-needed showcase of American pride celebrating the Army, while critics slam it as a president's ego trip.\n\nBut Saturday’s military parade isn’t the first in the nation’s capital. That last one was the National Victory Celebration, which took place June 8, 1991, two months after the end of Operation Desert Storm.\n\n“By God, we’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all,” President George H.W. Bush said in March 1991, after the U.S.-led coalition kicked the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in a war that lasted about 100 hours.\n\nSome back then called the parade -- which cost about $12 million before inflation -- \"a waste of time, effort and money,\" but mostly it was a patriotic celebration that turned out roughly 800,000 people that didn't feature nationwide protests.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump: A ‘rainy day’ brings good luck\n\nThe president isn’t letting a poor forecast dampen his mood as he celebrates his 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th.\n\n“OUR GREAT MILITARY PARADE IS ON, RAIN OR SHINE,” Trump said in a Saturday morning post on Truth Social, his social media platform. “REMEMBER, A RAINY DAY PARADE BRINGS GOOD LUCK. I’LL SEE YOU ALL IN D.C.”\n\nRain and thunderstorms might damper the massive military showcase as much eastern half of the country are experiencing showers through the weekend. Remember the event is standing room only, according to the Secret Service.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Mother Nature has crashed a Trump event. If you recall, in January his second inauguration had to be moved to inside the U.S. Capitol due to intense cold.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nFitness competition underway\n\nDripping in sweat, U.S. Army Maj. Andres Nanez is proud he and his team finished the fitness competition on the National lawn in 10 minutes and seven seconds.\n\nThe timed test of endurance features a rope climb, Echo Bike ride, a three-person dead lift of more than 500 pounds, burpees and more, as spectators cheer on participants.\n\nNanez left the Fort Bragg base in North Carolina to attend the Saturday’s festivities with his fellow soldiers and family.\n\n“Representing the U.S. Army is what brought us all together and to compete at the biggest stage,” Nanez said. “Definitely enjoying this moment.”\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n‘God saved Trump so he can save America’\n\nDecked in a red, white, and blue suit embellished with the iconic image of President Donald Trump holding his fist in the air after an assassination attempt in Butler, Penn., Tien Tran drew attention from the crowds at the national Mall Saturday morning.\n\n“I’ve been wearing this since after the assassination attempt. I’ve been to rallies and to the inauguration,” Tran said. “God saved Trump so he could save America and he will save the world.”\n\nHe’s in town for one day celebrate the military and Trump’s birthday, which he says he celebrates every year in Orange County, Calif.\n\nHe sides with Trump in his ongoing arguments between his state’s governor over deployment of the National Guard after protests following ICE raids, saying Gavin Newsom has “failed” Californians.\n\n“They protest because either they are paid to do so or because they don’t love this country,” he alleged. “I’m a legal immigrant and I love this country and I don’t want to see it being destroyed.”\n\n—Rachel Barber\n\nDon’t forget, it’s Flag Day, too\n\nIt isn’t just the president and the Army’s birthdays.\n\nJune 14 also is when Old Glory, America's symbol of freedom with its 50 stars and 13 stripes, is celebrated.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\n‘It's pretty cool’: Army’s past on display with historic uniforms\n\nOnlookers will see hundreds of military vehicles and thousands of soldiers on Saturday that will be grouped together for each major era of the Army’s history.\n\nAs USA TODAY previously reported, of the roughly 7,000 soldiers flocking to D.C. from bases around the world, about 1,000 will be dressed up in the historical uniforms from Revolutionary War, Civil War, both world wars and other major conflicts.\n\nThe costumes were rented from the Motion Picture Costume Company – a Los Angeles-based contractor, and were used at a June 11 performance known as the Twilight Tattoo, which is open to the public weekly from May through July.\n\n\"It's pretty cool,\" Private Jonathan Cole, who wore a Gulf War-era camouflage uniform ahead of Saturday's parade, told USA TODAY.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey, Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nArmy recruitment up 10% ahead of Trump parade\n\nPart of Saturday’s parade is making a patriotic appeal to future soldiers after years of the Army struggling to meet its recruitment goals.\n\nU.S. military officials announced the branch met its annual recruiting target of 61,000 in the first week of June, which was a full four months ahead of the scheduled. That is roughly 10% higher than the 55,000 recruits the Army reported having last year.\n\n\"This achievement represents a significant turning point for the Army and indicates a renewed sense of patriotism and purpose among America's youth,” the Army said in a June 3 statement.\n\nSecretary of the Army Dan Driscoll attributed the rise to the “decisive leadership” of Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, but others have spotlighted the Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which was established in August 2022.\n\nFormer Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the Associated Press, for instance, that the program established under Biden might be responsible for as much as a third of this year's recruiting totals.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWho does and doesn’t like the Army, Trump b-day parade\n\nAs mentioned before, Americas might not like the cost of Saturday’s parade but a plurality do like the idea of holding one.\n\nA new AP-NORC poll found 40% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s decision versus 29% who disapprove.\n\nAs you may have expected, Democrats and liberal-leaning Americans aren’t too excited about it. Just 20% approve of the president’s decision while 50% disapprove, according to the survey.\n\nBut it’s a hit among Republicans and conservative-minded adults, with a whopping 67% giving Trump a thumbs up compared to only 11% who object.\n\nAmong independents, slightly more favor the parade than object with 27% approving and 19% disapproving. The remaining 54% said neither.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAmerican metal on full display\n\nWhatever you might think of Saturday’s parade, there’s no question D.C. streets will feel the weight.\n\nThe Army has made special preparations to minimize damage to the roadways as tons of vehicles and artillery will be coming through the nation’s capitol, such as:\n\nThe M1A2/Abrams tank : Arguably, the most impressive and fearsome weapon in the parade, or pretty much anywhere at 70 tons, the tank entered Army service 45 years ago and first saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. It carries a 120mm cannon, robust armor and has a top speed of 45 mph.\n\n: Arguably, the most impressive and fearsome weapon in the parade, or pretty much anywhere at 70 tons, the tank entered Army service 45 years ago and first saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

Bailey\n\nTrump, the oldest president, turns 79 today\n\nSaturday's parade might may also draw attention to Trump being the oldest commander-in-chief in U.S. history.\n\nBorn June 14, 1946, when Harry Truman was president, he set the record for oldest person to take office at 78 years and 7 months, ahead of Joe Biden, who was 78 years and 2 months when he took office in January 2021.\n\nThe age of American elected officials has been a topic of concern lately, mostly due to questions raised around Biden's acuity that hounded him for most of his term. Democrats have tried to do the same to Trump, such as when he mixed up the Japanese car company Nissan and the Japanese steel company Nippon last month.\n\n\"He is not the same person that I dealt with just four years ago, and he's incapable of even a train of thought,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said of Trump in a recent interview.\n\nBut that narrative hasn't stuck to Trump, who is known to ramble in public speeches but comes off as more vigorous to the public than Biden did.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nStorm clouds hang over parade\n\nWashington's weather forecast for the day of the parade shows a high of 83 degrees, with showers beginning in the late morning and possible thunderstorms after 2 p.m. local time.\n\nAfter 6 p.m., when the parade will kick off, forecasters predict a 75% chance of precipitation and some chance of thunder.\n\nThe Army said on June 13 that the weather is \"being closely monitored and taken into consideration, but at this point nothing has changed.\"\n\n'No Kings' protests pop up everywhere but DC\n\nMore than 1,800 \"No Kings\" protests against the parade, Trump, and what protesters call his authoritarian policies, are scheduled in cities and towns throughout the world – but not Washington.\n\nTrump first said on June 10 that protests would be met with \"very big force.\" The White House backtracked days later, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump \"of course\" supports peaceful protests.\n\nOther demonstrators have kept their plans in Washington on the day of the parade, with some fearing a crackdown like the response to protests against widescale deportations in Los Angeles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2025/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/special/2021/04/05/native-american-festivals-oklahoma-might-back-after-covid-hiatus/4649413001/", "title": "Sidelined by COVID-19, Native American festivals may be back this ...", "text": "Dino Lalli\n\nFor The Oklahoman\n\nThere always has been an enormous connection between Native Americans and the rhythms of their environment, to the land and to on another, as well as to their customs and traditions. Their oral traditions are a lifeline, of sorts, from generation to generation.\n\nDiverse is a word often used to describe the rich Native American heritage in Oklahoma. One of the many ways to experience that diversity is by visiting and enjoying Native American events and powwows held each year throughout the state. These events celebrate the culture of the state’s American Indian tribes, and the pride in having those festivals is extraordinary.\n\n“Tribal festivals allow us to come together at least once a year to celebrate who we are and where we come from as First American communities,” said Shoshana Wasserman, deputy director of the First Americans Museum and member of Thlopthlocco Tribal Town and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. “It may be the only time for some to return home, hear our languages and reconnect with cultural and traditional practices.”\n\nFirst Americans Museum will present its inaugural Art Market in 2022. The art market will take place in the museum’s outdoor Festival Plaza, which is the size of three football fields.\n\n“We look forward to bringing together premiere First American artists in Oklahoma and from across Indian Country,” Wasserman said. “Part of FAM’s mission has always been to cultivate a thriving art marketplace in Oklahoma.”\n\nLast year, COVID-19 caused several events throughout the state to be canceled. Some festivals also were postponed, but 2021 is more hopeful. Still, caution is strongly encouraged for anyone wishing to attend any event, and before you go, check for the latest attendance guidelines.\n\nHere are some festivals that, if pandemic conditions improve, are expected this year:\n\nThe first weekend in April, there is the UCO Spring Pow Wow, with one of the specific events being the Gourd Dance.\n\nThe 35th annual Red Earth Festival will take place June 12-13 at the Event Center at the Grand Casino Hotel and Resort close to downtown Oklahoma City. Dancers from many tribes participate in the Saturday parade and the powwow takes place on Saturday and Sunday, when dancers from around the world perform.\n\nAbout mid-June, the Muscogee Creek Nation Festival is held at the Claude Cox Omniplex in Okmulgee. This free festival celebrates the living culture of the Muscogee (Creek) people.\n\nThe Sac & Fox Nation Pow Wow has been occurring for more than 50 years. A 5K, singing, dance and drum competitions are just a few events that will be taking place for four days around the second weekend in July at the Jim Thorpe Memorial Park in Stroud.\n\nThe Oklahoma Indian Nation Pow-Wow will be in early August at the Concho Powwow Grounds. The Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes host this free event.\n\nPowwow of Champions also will take place mid-August at the Mabee Center in Tulsa. This powwow is hosted by the Intertribal Indian Club of Tulsa and will be featuring dancers from tribes across the country, as well as an arts and crafts market, during this event.\n\nThe Ponca Tribal Powwow and Celebration at White Eagle Park in Ponca City certainly has a rich history. It began in 1879 and was one of the first intertribal powwows held in Oklahoma. This year, it's planned for late August.\n\nCherokee National Holiday celebrations will be going on at various locations in Tahlequah over Labor Day weekend as thousands come to town to celebrate the tribe’s culture and heritage. The Choctaw Nation Labor Day Festival, hosted for more than 60 years, also takes place about Labor Day weekend. Among the activities at this festival are an intertribal powwow, princess pageant and fine art market feature work from Choctaw artists.\n\nOn the last Friday and Saturday in September is the Standing Bear Pow Wow in Ponca City. This is a free event hosted by Oklahoma’s six north-central tribes — the Kaw, Osage, Otoe-Missouria, Pawnee, Ponca and Tonkawa. Intertribal dancing and a variety of vendors selling food, arts and crafts will be there.\n\nThe Chickasaw Annual Meeting and Festival is a nine-day event in late September and early October at various locations in Ada, Tishomingo and Sulphur. Celebrating Chickasaw culture, heritage and tradition are a big part of the festival, along with activities that include a traditional meal, an art show and market and cultural demonstrations.\n\nAgain, regardless of the event you plan on attending, check before you go to make sure the festival or powwow has not been canceled, postponed or times changed.\n\nYou can find a list of Native American festivals and powwows at the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation website, Travelok.com, and in the Oklahoma Indian Country Guide, which is also available at Tourism Informational Centers and the state tourism website.\n\nDino Lalli is the producer, co-host and one of the reporters for the weekly television travel show \"Discover Oklahoma.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2016/10/01/rochelle-riley-lessons-3-days-charlotte/91111632/", "title": "Rochelle Riley: Lessons from 3 days in Charlotte", "text": "Rochelle Riley\n\nDetroit Free Press Columnist\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Last Saturday afternoon, I should have been standing on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., hearing the nation’s first black president extol the virtue, no, the necessity of a museum devoted to African-American history and contributions to our country.\n\nInstead, I was boarding a plane bound for the New South. A white gentleman waiting in line beside me, upon learning that I am a journalist headed to Charlotte to cover the aftermath of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting, said, “I wish we were sitting next to each other. Perhaps you could educate me.”\n\nThat moment holds the answer to the problem with race relations in this country.\n\nAmerica doesn’t teach its students that African Americans had to fight for the right to vote, the right to choose a neighborhood, the right to choose a school. For centuries, there has been an unwillingness to accept that blacks and whites both helped build this country, that blacks and whites are equal citizens, but without equal rights.\n\nThe fact that inferiority must exist for a superior class to rise — has led to economic, educational, health and justice disparities as well as a disdain and fear that could be contributing to the rising spate of police killings of black men.\n\nIt didn't have to be this way.\n\nIt appears more fate than happenstance that tens of thousands of people marched into the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture on the same day that hundreds marched all over Charlotte, a city that has prided itself on its perceived tolerance. But for its black residents, the Scott shooting has torn off a mask. Now this city of nearly 800,000 bears the same mark as Ferguson, Baton Rouge, St. Paul, Tulsa and other cities where death has amplified conversations about race.\n\nPeople outside the Queen City are seeing the real Charlotte.\n\nS-h-h-h. It’s not as pretty as you thought.\n\nBut this column isn’t just about the economic and racial disparities that exist in Charlotte, that exist in nearly every city in America.\n\nThis column is about the misconceptions that come from ignorance. The nation's eyes were on Charlotte and another killing of a black man by police even as the museum celebrated our history in Washington. One can't help but wonder: Would it be so easy to see all black men as criminals if America had embraced the rest of the story, the history now reflected in 36,000 artifacts in the 400,000-square foot museum that sits 402 miles northeast of here?\n\nFive weeks before the presidential election, the police shootings have made race an inescapable issue for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And the most recent comes as both campaigns face the challenge of wooing millennial as well as black voters at the heart of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nWill Charlotte, the symbol of the New South, a place one activist says reeks of “paralyzing politeness,” be the city that finally wakes America up?\n\nI spent three days studying the heartbreaking aftermath of Keith Lamont Scott's death and watched residents grapple with that question.\n\nSATURDAY: PAST\n\nI arrive at the Hyatt House Uptown just blocks from the Epicentre, the massive entertainment and food complex whose name is spoken with pride by some residents and resentment by others. Some black residents contend that the Epicentre is not for them. Within a week of the Scott shooting, three women reportedly file a complaint against a club they contend denied them entry. I can't help but wonder what the bouncer's attitude might have been had he known of the black female NASA mathematicians who helped launch astronaut John Glenn into outer space.\n\nThe Hyatt’s street windows are boarded over with plywood, having lost their glass to angry violence nights after officers shot and killed Scott as he stood outside his SUV while his wife pleaded for his life.\n\nIt is 3 p.m., and, as if on cue, two police cars block traffic so a crowd that seems to appear from nowhere can surge forth. They shout for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department to release video of the Scott shooting, something the chief seems loathe to do in a state that next month will ban such releases.\n\nThe demonstration happens quickly.\n\nThe patrol cars move as if synchronized, just in time for the marchers to pass. Then, the regular street hustle begins anew. For blocks, it is now hard to tell the family reunions from the protests, matching T-shirts, loud voices. A wedding spills out of a church, laughter rising through the trees. It appears to be a typical weekend, save the presence of camouflaged soldiers and cops on most corners, some chatting, some standing, all waiting for the next demonstration, all, like residents, waiting for the release of the videotape showing the killing of Keith Scott.\n\nWhen the last stragglers clear the block, so do the police. It is as if nothing happened.\n\nNine miles from downtown, others await the release of video at the crime scene.\n\nOrange chalk marks still outline what happened in the front parking lot at The Village at College Downs, a town home complex about a half-mile from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. A tent covers the space on the left side. Under it is a growing pile of flowers, stuffed animals and candles serving as reminders that a man died there just days before.\n\nAccording to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police chief — and news reports — Keith Lamont Scott, a 43-year-old father of seven, was sitting in his car, holding a joint and a gun, waiting to pick up one of his children from the school bus, out in the open, as police serving a warrant on someone else saw him, left to suit up, and came back to surround him. They made him get out of his car, yelled at him to drop a gun and then shot him to death as his wife begged for his life. It all happened in the parking space that is now a memorial in this complex of working-class parents, students and neighbors, many of whom don’t believe for a second that what the police say is true.\n\nA gaggle of women stands guard at the monument, not to register guests, but to watch as cars parade past. Some people stop and chat. All ask the same questions protesters have across the city:\n\nWhy didn’t the police use a Taser on Scott rather than scream at him for precious seconds?\n\nWhy did they not heed his wife’s concern that he had brain injury and would not hurt them?\n\nWhy shoot to kill a man backing away from some officers, his back to others?\n\nWhy didn’t they ask for Rakeyia Scott’s help to de-escalate the situation?\n\nWhy shoot to kill a man whose hands were at his sides?\n\nIt is 5:30 p.m., and Flo Sessoms stands 20 feet from the memorial tent and 402 miles from the new black museum in Washington, arriving after watching President Obama offer hope that visitors to the newest Smithsonian museum who didn't get it before will finally \"understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson and Charlotte.\"\n\nFlo Sessoms doesn’t live here; she doesn’t maintain this memorial. A woman with a short gray Afro who lives nearby comes out and tosses dead flowers and arranges new ones every few hours. But Sessoms, a 62-year-old mother of three, a Charlotte native who taught thousands of sixth-graders in the city school district until 1997 when she left the classroom to work in administration, lives only 3 miles away. She says she had to come.\n\n“I wanted to just be in the space, to feel where his wife was standing when she saw her husband killed,” Sessoms says. “To hear her beg for them not to shoot her husband …\n\n“I was just thinking about how, during slavery time, wives were snatched away from their husbands and husbands were snatched away from their wives, right there in front of them. They didn’t have to shoot that man . . . and she was just begging for her husband’s life.\"\n\nSuddenly, Sessoms begins to fill in the history of her Charlotte, alternating between pride and pain, tolerance and loss.\n\nShe tells me the story of Brooklyn, the familiar, old name for Charlotte's Second Ward. Brooklyn was home to the worst slums in Charlotte. But Brooklyn also was home to most of the city's black businesses, churches and homeowners, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Landmark Commission. Between 1960 and 1967, officials displaced 1,007 families and 216 businesses, according to commission reports. The families and their neighborhood were replaced by the current government plaza and office development and 75,000-seat Bank of America stadium.\n\n\"Not a single new residential unit was built to replace the 1,480 structures demolished,\" according to the commission report on the displacement.\n\n“They told the people who lived there that one day they’d be able to come back to their homes,” says Sessoms, who was in middle school when it happened. “These were shotgun houses, slums. My family was one of the last families to move … .\n\n“Where the stadium sits, Panthers stadium? That was Brooklyn.”\n\nSessoms laments that the “babies,” as she calls them, who turned out in droves and shut down Interstate 277, probably didn’t even know they were standing on historic ground, space that once held the hospital where most black residents older than 54 were born.\n\nEven the dulcet tones of a Southern accent cannot hide the resentment in Sessoms' voice. She also reminds me of Charlotte’s last police shooting that drew national attention. Three Septembers ago, former Florida A&M University football player Jonathan Ferrell was hurt in a car accident and banged on a stranger’s door for help. The stranger called 911; officers shot Ferrell to death as he approached them for aid. The city settled his family's lawsuit for $2.25 million and paid the officer, Randall Kirk, $100,000 when he resigned.\n\nThere were no major protests in the days immediately after Ferrell's death, she says.\n\n“I was embarrassed by that.\"\n\nDemonstrations did come the next year when a jury couldn’t reach a verdict in the Kerrick trial, and a judge declared a mistrial.Two people were arrested.\n\nCharlotte moved on.\n\nBut that was then, before Michael Brown and Eric Garner and Freddie Gray and Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and Terence Crutcher. It was before Black Lives Matter. It was before racists found a presidential election that allowed them to take off their invisible hoods.\n\nNow, Charlotte is no longer the Charlotte where the anger simmers beneath. And people are driving past a tent over a parking space because they feel compelled to do so.\n\n“I wouldn’t say there are two Charlottes, or maybe so,” Sessoms says. “I do know that those babies that were wreaking havoc, they’re the same children — I’m a retired educator — they’re the same babies who didn’t feel like they were successful in school or they could be successful. They can get attention now. … They’re the same babies who have been disenfranchised. They don’t have jobs because if they had a job, they wouldn’t have been out doing that.”\n\nSuddenly, Marie Peppers drives up and guides her 10-year-old son Jordan and two of his friends to the tent. Each lays a rose on the ground. She didn’t know Scott,\n\n“I felt an obligation to come and to pay respects because I have a 28-year-old son,\" she says. \"I have three boys and a grandson, so it hurts me.\n\n“I don’t know what to say to them,” she says of her sons. “Anyone who is authorized to shoot someone should have to wear body cameras.\"\n\nShe laments North Carolina’s new law that bans police from publicly releasing their video. But her tearful voice isn’t that of an angry activist. It is of a frightened mother who just wants the shootings to stop.\n\n“It breaks my heart,” she says. “This is so sad.”\n\nShe walks the boys back to the car and, like that, they are replaced by other strangers who walk over to drop a flower or stand, head bowed.\n\nFlo Sessoms and the women — they are all women — spend hours near the tent or sitting on the curb. Occasionally, there is a flicker of recognition between Sessoms and a new arrival.\n\n“Didn’t I teach you?” Sessoms asks one former student.\n\nSuddenly, Sessoms gets an alert on her phone. The video of the shooting is about to be released.\n\n“The videotape is out,\" she says, raising her phone.\n\nA woman screams from a balcony. She says the video shows that a white police officer, not the black officer the chief has identified, actually shot Scott.\n\nThe women in the parking lot gasp.\n\nSessoms and everyone else later learn the video is inconclusive.\n\nSUNDAY: PRESENT\n\nCars pull into the parking lot of the Trinity Episcopal School. It's the home of the Wildcats athletic teams, except on Sundays.\n\nThen it is home to St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church, whose congregation worships in the cafeteria. Today is its 133rd anniversary in existence and its 48th year of being homeless after the destruction of the Brooklyn neighborhood.,\n\nHere in Charlotte, this small congregation holds onto its history the way the museum in Washington is holding onto a national narrative that includes geniuses and builders, ministers who were the stalwarts of the civil rights movement and athletes who will never gain the glory they deserved.\n\nSessoms is late to church on this day because she’s picking up the post-service repast, a mix of chicken salad sandwiches, deviled eggs, fresh fruit, chicken wings and peach cobbler. It has been only 17 hours since the flurry of activity in the parking lot. The two tiny pieces of videotape the police release actually provide very little information to increase understanding.\n\nBut here at Trinity, on this Sunday morning, there is only prayer for peace and progress rather than discussions of the police shooting. A white Episcopal priest administers communion. There is nothing unusual about it. Most black congregations grew from white denominations, a fact that might surprise some of the same Americans stunned during the Democratic National Convention when first lady Michelle Obama talked about the slaves who built the White House.\n\nThe service is a beautiful reminder that life goes on, despite tragedy, despite discord. There is no more mention of the shooting until someone stands during announcements to alert the congregation to another protest.\n\nYes, Charlotte is a place where polite is almost a verb. Residents go along to get along here. But the Scott killing has given all of Charlotte a chance to raise issues they’ve long felt were being ignored. The protests are not just about police but demand better treatment of the gay and transgender community and demand more jobs and job training.\n\nThe two Charlottes have been the subject of much attention for years, and again after the shooting. Charlotte's poor residents are the least likely to climb out of poverty among poor residents in America’s 50 largest cities, according to a 2015 joint study by professors at Stanford, Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley. Moreover, 40% of black households in Charlotte live on an annual income of $30,000 or less, according to a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill poverty study. Nearly 35% of white households earn more than $100,000, and less than 10% live in poverty.\n\nChanging the narrative means understanding what is real in every neighborhood, community leaders advise. It means that Charlotte can no longer believe its own hype and must face the truth where its poor residents are concerned.\n\n“We have a city that has an incredible depth of poverty, but we don’t see it because there’s so much wealth,” says Rodney Sadler, an activist with the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice and an associate professor at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nSadler cites his colleague Robin Tanner’s description of the real Charlotte as a place beset by \"a paralyzing politeness.\"\n\n“We will not talk about the problems, and we are nice to a fault,” he says. “Instead of dealing with racial injustice over the years, what we have in Charlotte is a system that is nice to the poor. Instead of a system of justice, we have a well-developed system of charity. We will give homeless people a shelter to live in. We will give hungry people loaves and fishes for the day, food for the week. We will give you charities that you need to perpetuate your life.”\n\nBut that, he said, is not what Charlotte needs. It is not what America’s poor need.\n\n“Why is it that people are unemployed even if they have skills, that if they live in black and brown skin, people aren’t hiring them? So we do the nice charity things but we fail to do ... the things that are required to truly improve circumstances.\"\n\nUnder a national spotlight, what becomes clear is that Charlotte, the place where people learned for years to stay in their lanes, to not share the city’s family business, may not be the same.\n\n\"My great-grandmother, when I first came here, taught me something that she was trying to help me understand,” Joanne Stevenson Jenkins, a St. Michael parishioner and activist who works in a homeless shelter, says after the church service. “She said, ‘In the North, where you came from people don’t live close together, so you have separated communities black, white, Polish, Irish. She said here in the South, it’s black and white. And the rule is you can live as close as you can, as close as you want to each other, as long as you remember your place and you remember ‘Don’t get too big.’ And she was talking about black people.\n\n“People have gotten so used to living over stuff, suffering underneath but they live over it, and they live over it and they live over it,” she says. “And then something happens, and there’s no more room to suffer underneath. That’s what’s going on.”\n\nShe stands with Father Armand LaVallee, who shares duties with other priests to care for St. Michael. The New England native says the only way to solve America's race problem is intermarriage. That is what fixed it in his family, he says.\n\nCharlotte's present, not its past, is the problem, says Sadler who again cited the study showing the Queen City 50th among the top 50 cities when measuring the possibility of upward mobility for those with black or brown skin.\n\n“If you have black or brown skin and you’re poor, you’ll be poor your whole life,” he said. “Charlotte has a history of having a great economic divide and a significant racial divide ... .\"\n\nIn Charlotte, “we have the Crescent and the Wedge,” he says. The Crescent comprises the northern, western and eastern parts of the city. The Wedge, by and large, is home to wealthy white Charlotte.\n\nIn Charlotte, people want the Wedge dream, or the accoutrements that come with that level of living, he says.\n\n“We’re the third largest banking capital in the United States, and that offsets poverty of blacks,” Sadler says. “We look like a city doing reasonably well until you look on the ground.”\n\n\n\nThe Charlotte conversation happening now is happening on the ground. And on the ground, in the streets and among black people, we know the story of Madame C.J. Walker, the first black female millionaire. Black people know the stories of hundreds of African-American inventors and learn about more than George Washington Carver’s work with peanuts.\n\nWhat if the open casket of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered by racists for whistling at a white woman, had appeared on the front page of the New York Times in 1955 rather than only in the black press? Would his mother’s courageous decision to bear witness to that brutality have changed anything? Would white America have seen what happened to a black boy and been moved to change?\n\nThere are two required activities on Sunday: church and football. The protesters know this and have amassed outside Bank of America Stadium to ensure that the national media and thousands of football fans cannot miss them.\n\nFlo Sessoms, her grandson DeWayne McKinnon Jr., and the rest of her family do not get to the stadium until halftime, and the anxiety level is palpable.\n\n“My grandson . . . I could tell he’s feeling my energy,\" she says. \"During the game, there are usually so many people looking for tickets and tailgating, and it’s a festive atmosphere. But this time, the streets for a mile as we walked to the game were eerily silent.\"\n\nThey approach the stadium and walk through a wall of police officers, two rows deep \"and each time my grandson would see a group of police officers he would grab my hand,” she recalls.\n\nMONDAY: FUTURE\n\nThe weekend over, Charlotte prepares for the first City Council meeting since the Scott shooting. Of the dozens of people who pack the Charlotte-Mecklenberg Government Center, it is one of the smallest audience members who makes the biggest impression.\n\nNine-year-old Zianna Oliphant will not know for days that her tearful appearance will be shared on the Web more than 80,000 times.\n\n“I’ve come here today to talk about how I feel, and I feel like that we are treated differently than other people,” she says in a videotape that results in dozens of local and national interviews and a trip to Disney on Ice.\n\n“I don’t like how we’re treated. … We are black people, and we shouldn’t have to feel like this,\" she says. \"We shouldn’t have to protest because y’all are treating us wrong. We do this because we need to and have rights.\"\n\nAs her tears fall, she says, “It’s a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can’t even see them anymore. It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears, and we shouldn’t have tears.”\n\nAs the little girl faces Mayor Jennifer Roberts, do those watching her see a future mayor? Do they see her through the historical lens of Shirley Chisholm and Mary McLeod Bethune and Condoleezza Rice?\n\nHer mother, Precious Oliphant, a 29-year-old hairdresser, says that Zianna and her 11-year-old brother, Marquis, talk with her about these issues and the news but being at the council meeting is happenstance.\n\n\"My boyfriend and I were in the crowd of protesters and ... a woman told us about the meeting,\" she says. \"I wouldn't allow my kids to partake in the protesting because it was too dangerous. So I figured the meeting would be a perfect place for them to see what's going on.\"\n\nA council staffer passing around a sign-up sheet jokingly asked the kids whether they wanted to speak, Oliphant recalls. They said no, but Zianna changed her mind. Then she and her brother both both rose up.\n\nAnd the little girl who likes to bake and sing and who turns her bedroom into a classroom when her cousins come to visit — the future teacher, lawyer, doctor and community activist — stood before strangers and cried out for justice.\n\n\"My mom and I watch the news every morning and every night,\" she tells me days after her council appearance. \"I don't think people should be afraid of the police because they can stand up for themselves.\"\n\nPrecious Oliphant says America's racial tensions would be better not only if people of other colors knew black history but if black people knew more about their own.\n\n\"I encourage the children to do their own research, especially during Black History Month,\" she says. \"We pick one person every week, and on Sunday night, we all present projects as far as who we researched and what they're famous for and how they made an impact on the community. This is what I want to instill in my children.\"\n\nZianna's decision to stand up and make an impact is in line with their lessons, she says.\n\nThe day after the council meeting, Zianna's mother goes with her to school. She wants no repercussions for Zianna speaking her mind.\n\n\"School is the most important thing to me,\" she says. \"I wanted to make sure we were on the same page and that anyone who disagrees with her doesn't cause problems because, with all this attention, school is the place where I want her to be a normal kid.\"\n\nWe cannot let America forget that at the heart of the debate over police shootings, over poverty or the opportunity to get ahead, are children who just want normal lives. Instead, some of them are kids losing loved ones, being raised by parents afraid to lose them or being little girls forced to think about graveyards and death and tears.\n\nMayor Jennifer Roberts says in an interview that Charlotte will recover, that \"Charlotte has a strong reputation, and we are living that reputation.\"\n\nBut which reputation will survive? The one in which people know their place, and color is an obstacle that history has not erased? Or the one that Zianna described?\n\nOn Monday night, Flo Sessoms stays in. She skips the City Council meeting. She is done with the protests. She wants her Charlotte back, only better.\n\nShe watches the presidential debate and is not happy with Donald Trump's assertion that black and Latino people live in hell. Perhaps a trip to the national African-American museum might help him and many, many others understand that not all black people, not all Hispanic people, not all white people, are alike.\n\n“I live in a beautiful city. I live in a wonderful city. I live in a city like all other cities in this United States of America,\" she says. \"If there’s an African-American man in that city, he is at risk of being killed. He’s at a higher risk, and it doesn’t matter the city. And what happens next is based on how long the people there have felt oppressed and enough is enough.\n\n“That young man that was killed in this city three years ago, I think 10 or 12 bullets is what that police officer felt like he had to empty into that lady’s baby” she says. “People seem to forget and move on. Until the next one happens.”\n\nContact Rochelle Riley: rriley99@freepress.com.

She remembers riding on the Canton Savings and Loan's float in 1974 through the downtown maze of one-way streets. \"I was up front in this twirly thing, waving at everybody, and we would go across the bridge.\"\n\nIn a service and consumer society, Labor Day has become a long weekend, a last hurrah for summer picnics or beach outings, as labor unions have lost much of their power nationwide and many towns lost their manufacturing base.\n\nCanton saw its Evergreen Packaging paper mill survive but watched its downtown decay and the annual parade dwindle in attendance.\n\nNow town officials are betting that a revamped Labor Day weekend could help boost the economy of the Haywood County burg less than 10 miles from Asheville's city limits.\n\nRebranding itself as \"WNC's hometown,\" Canton could become the mountains' next boom town with affordable housing and commercial rents.\n\n\"We haven't been very good about telling our story,\" conceded Seth Hendler-Voss, the town manager.\n\nAfter last year's decreased turnout at the parade and festival, the Canton Board of Aldermen asked Hendler-Voss and town staff to come up with ideas to increase attendance. The new town manager saw the holiday as a possible key to a decadeslong puzzle of economic revitalization for the town of 4,400.\n\nFirst of all they had to move the festival back into the center from downtown instead of the recreation park about a quarter mile away.\n\nCanton has pumped up the free festival's bill with 20 different bands, including funk and rock to draw a more diverse crowd at Sorrell Park just down from the town hall. There will be seven food trucks on hand, thanks to the town's new ordinance.\n\nThe three days are free to the public, with a $65,000 budget. The town has contributed $10,000, but Champion Credit Union has picked up much of the bill as the chief sponsor.\n\nLabor Day itself will feature the traditional parade through town, bluegrass and clogging, a 200-vehicle classic car show, and free swimming at the town pool.\n\n\"We want to show that Canton knows how to throw a party,\" Hendler-Voss said.\n\nMountains' first mill town\n\nBut coming into downtown, there's no hiding Canton's unglamorous hard-working history.\n\nDriving in from the Canton exit off Interstate 40, visitors first see Evergreen Packaging's massive smokestacks billowing out white plumes of vapor that join the clouds in a late summer sky.\n\nOhio printer Peter Thomson founded the Champion Paper Co. His son-in-law Reuben B. Robertson founded the Champion Fibre Co. in 1906, to provide wood pulp for the Ohio paper mill.\n\nThe Canton pulp mill was the region's first massive industrial operation, paving the way for manufacturing to boom in the early 20th century across the mountains.\n\nChampion sponsored the first Labor Day parade in 1906 to salute its workers, and the tradition stuck in Canton.\n\nThe plant is now a subsidiary of Evergreen Packaging, now owned by a New Zealand holding company. From cardboard and milk-cartons, Evergreen has followed market demands, becoming the leading manufacturer of paper products like the grande cup of latte you order at a Starbucks anywhere on the East Coast.\n\nOrganized labor remains strong at the Canton mill with 600 union jobs out of a workforce of 1,200 with an average annual salary of $78,000.\n\nCanton natives like Chris May concede their town has had a bad reputation for industrial pollution that once fouled the Pigeon River flowing into Tennessee. The Champion smokestacks once belched a stench that could be smelled as far away as Asheville depending on which way the winds were blowing.\n\nThe company has spent millions in past decades to improve the Pigeon River and the air quality, but still remains a leading polluter in the region while meeting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. Evergreen will spend $50 million over the next five years to replace coal-fired boilers with natural gas boilers.\n\nLikewise, the town has spent much of the past decade rebuilding infrastructure damaged in the flooding of 2004 when remnants of two hurricanes swelled the Pigeon River and swamped the downtown.\n\nRecruiting businesses\n\nThe town is considering extending water and sewer down U.S. 19 toward Candler, perhaps coaxing more businesses and mixed-use development. \"That corridor is going to be the future of Canton,\" said Hendler-Voss.\n\nThe town board recently passed an ordinance for commercial property maintenance, set to go in effect late this month. Property owners in the historic downtown who let broken windows, rotting wood or unstable foundations go unrepaired could face fines of $50 to $500.\n\nCleaning up eyesores downtown could persuade new investors to make a bet in Canton's future, officials believe.\n\nCanton wasn't the first place Steve Kaufman considered when looking to expand space for RNM Engineering, a 50-year-old Waynesville firm specializing in mechanical engineering.\n\nKaufman looked in Asheville where most of the firm's clients are located, but commercial space was prohibitively priced. It was even hard to find a place in Waynesville.\n\nKaufman and the engineering firm were able to buy the 1919 Brannon Building in downtown Canton and renovate the wood floors, keeping much of the distinctive stamped tin ceilings and original bead-board on the second and third floors. \"It's got great bones.\"\n\nThe town of Canton sweetened the pot with $10,000 in grants for restoring the facade and part of the interior.\n\n\"Now instead of a 40-minute drive from Waynesville, we have a 20-minute drive from Canton into Asheville,\" Kaufman said.\n\nKaufman was surprised at the reception his business has received coming to town. \"I wasn't expecting this local support.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Canton native May has been putting his money into older buildings in the downtown, renovating and leasing them to new businesses.\n\nThis week, he was putting the final touches on Kobe Express, a Japanese restaurant opening up a new location. It's the fourth for Kobe, which has restaurants in Waynesville, Sylva and Cherokee. The sushi eatery will be only the third new restaurant opened in downtown Canton.\n\nWith breweries popping up everywhere around Asheville and beyond, May and others believe it's only a matter of time before craft beer is manufactured in Canton.\n\n\"We're not here to make Canton the next Asheville,\" May said. \"But compare the cost of living here versus Buncombe County with its shortage of affordable housing and its traffic congestion, and I believe that goods and services and people will want to come here.\"\n\nWorking families could get better prices and more for their money in Canton's close-knit neighborhoods or out in the surrounding countryside in the Bethel area. \"What would cost you $300,000 in Buncombe, you could get for $200,000 or $180,000 here,\" May said.\n\n\"And Canton is only 9.8 miles from the Asheville city limits,\" May said.\n\nCanton is no longer afraid to bill itself as a bedroom community, reliant on its neighbors. While Evergreen has good, high-paying jobs that serve many in Haywood, Canton is home to many commuters.\n\n\"We see a line of headlights headed out of Canton each morning around 6:30 a.m.,\" said Jason Burrell, the assistant town manager and clerk who heads economic development.\n\n\"When they come back from working in Asheville, we don't want them to have to change clothes and turn around to go back to Asheville to eat or for a date night,\" Burrell said. \"We want them to be able to come downtown and eat or have a beer, or play with the kids in the park.\"\n\nHendler-Voss, 37, has been on the job only a little more than a year. With a background as a landscape architect, Hendler-Voss had worked previously in the City of Asheville parks department for nine years. He wanted to take his talents in \"place-making\" to manage a small town like Canton.\n\nCanton is a close-knit community where the police chief Bryan Whitener, on the force for 18 years, walks the sidewalk up and down and greets neighbors. But the small town feel aside, Canton has never been known as a scenic destination.\n\nOn some tourism maps, Canton has simply disappeared between Asheville and Waynesville, Hendler-Voss laments.\n\nBut visitors are flocking to the former industrial section of Asheville's River Arts District where abandoned warehouses have been readapted.\n\n\"We have a town where we are still making things,\" Hendler-Voss said. That working class vibe could work to Canton's advantage.\n\nHe's been getting encouragement from many of the town's older residents.\n\nOut walking Main Street, he runs into Chief Whitener who's out patrolling his jurisdiction and talking to friends.\n\nEdie Burnette stopped her car and rolled down her window to chat with her town manager and her police chief. Like many residents, she's looking forward to celebrating Labor Day with her neighbors and what could come to Canton in the near future.\n\n\"There's an energy in town,\" Burnette said. \"I think this is a new beginning.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nCanton will hold its 109th annual Labor Day Festival sponsored by Champion Credit Union Saturday through Monday. All events are free to the public.\n\nThe WNC Country Roots and Rock Experience will be held 3-10 p.m. Saturday in Sorrells Street Park.\n\nBands include Porch 40, Joe Lasher Jr., Soldier's Heart, Aaron Burdet and Josh Noren\n\nSunday 1-10 p.m. Papertown Bluegrass Jam in Sorrells Street Park will feature Balsam Range, the Snyder family, Mangas, Colorado, Locust Honey String Band, Danielle Bishop and Stuart Brothers.\n\nMonday, the 109th Labor Day parade will be held 10 a.m.-noon downtown.\n\nThe Canton Heritage Homecoming with bluegrass and clogging will be held 12-10 p.m. at Rec Park.\n\nThe vintage car show will be held 12-4 p.m. at Canton Middle School.\n\nFor information, click on cantonlaborday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/california/2025/06/12/what-to-bring-to-a-protest-no-kings-protest-june-14/84157143007/", "title": "Going to a No Kings protest on the day of Trump's military parade ...", "text": "Organizers say demonstrations are for people to unite and reject \"authoritarian politics\" in the U.S.\n\nNo Kings Nationwide Day of Defiance is on June 14, the same day the U.S. Army celebrates its 250th anniversary with a military parade in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile protests may vary, organizers say a core principle behind the events is \"a commitment to nonviolent action.\"\n\nNo Kings protests are taking place across California. Experts advise that when going to a protest, people should bring water, face masks, medication and more.\n\nJust over a week after protests erupted in Los Angeles, comes a day of planned demonstrations across California and the United States, where attendees will reject “authoritarian politics” in the nation.\n\nKnown as the “No Kings Nationwide Day of Defiance,” the demonstrations serve to divert attention from a military parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, June 14, which organizers say President Donald Trump is using to celebrate himself. The parade, which celebrates the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, coincides with the president’s 79th birthday.\n\n“This is bigger than politics,” organizers said in a news release. “They’ve defied our courts, deported citizens, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, slashed essential services, and handed billions to their allies. Enough is enough.”\n\nWhat can I expect at a No Kings protest?\n\nBecause local organizers are involved in setting up No Kings events, each demonstration can look a bit different.

An offline-accessible map can help. During the protest, remain aware of your surroundings and what's happening around you.\n\nWhile the First Amendment protects your right to say your opinions, keep in mind that making “true threats” or saying things that incite imminent violence or law-breaking can get you into trouble, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California.\n\nAlso, counter-protestors are allowed to show up and voice their contrasting opinions, although they shouldn’t be allowed to physically disrupt the event, according to the ACLU of Southern California.\n\nWhile demonstrators are urged to act lawfully at No Kings protests, tensions can escalate or bad actors can be present, heightening the possibility of arrests. People are urged to remember that if they are arrested, they have the right to remain silent, although they should not refuse to tell the police their name and address, according to both the ACLU of NorCal and SoCal.\n\nWhat should I bring to a protest?\n\nExperts at Physicians for Human Rights suggest bringing the following:\n\nBackpack or string bag: You won't want anything bulky and you'll want your hands free.

According to Dumas, the resin is “very good for your health, especially good for your stomach.” You can drink Lefkes’ Mastiha Fresh for its purported health benefits, but many drink it for its cool refreshing flavors delivered by a generous amount of Bombay Sapphire rum mixed with fresh lemon juice, homemade honey syrup and a thin slice of fresh cucumber. $12\n\nGo: 495 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs; 201-408-4444, http://lefkesnj.com/\n\nYacht Juice, Icarus Brewing Co., Lakewood\n\nLakewood's Icarus Brewing Co. has quickly become known across the state for its juice bombs, that thick and hazy India Pale Ale that's ragingly popular across the North East.\n\nAn imperial India Pale Ale introduced in Summer 2017, Yacht Juice is brewed with Citra, Columbus and Mosaic hops, clicking in at 8 percent ABV.\n\nThis juicy-yet-mellow ale is an incredibly inviting summer sipper.

Heck, it’s usually served in a copper mug to take on the cold temperature of all that heady liquid mixture. Faubourg, the swanky French brasserie that recently opened in Montclair, decided to make a Mule that’s even more summery and tropical that the classic, using passion fruit puree. It’s served in a highball glass -- a great cocktail to drink on Faubourg’s spacious patio on a hot summer evening.\n\nGo: 544 Bloomfield Ave., Montclair; 973-542-7700; faubourgmontclair.com/\n\nHarvest Peach Bourbon, Harvest Seasonal Grill & Wine Bar, Moorestown\n\nIt feels downright virtuous dining at this Moorestown restaurant and wine bar, with its focus on health fare.

McHugh\n\nNewport Life\n\nNewport shares an inextricable bond with American cocktail culture. In 1673, the White Horse Tavern opened at the corner of Farewell and Marlborough streets (where it still stands), offering our Colonial forebearers fermented beverages that were probably a safer option than the water that was available at the time.\n\nBy the late 1800s, intoxicants with a little more creativity were making their way onto menus coast to coast. As habitual overindulgence became part of the national conversation and the temperance movement gripped the country, Rhode Island was one of only two states that rejected the Eighteenth Amendment ushering in Prohibition. (The other was Connecticut.) In the 13 years that followed, Narragansett Bay became a haven for “rum runner” boats that bootleggers used to stock America’s speakeasies.\n\nToday, our corner of the coast is filled to the brim with classic and inventive cocktail and mocktail menus. We’ve highlighted some not-to-miss concoctions, just in time for your summer consumption.\n\nBest reason to download ‘Happy Days are Here Again’\n\nSince springtime, Jeff and Geremie Callaghan, proprietors of Fluke Newport, have been researching the 1920s, when post-influenza America experienced an economic and cultural revival. The aim was to fashion a thoughtful “Roaring Twenties” cocktail menu.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\n“Gin was a huge feature in cocktails in the ’20s, because it was bathtub gin,” explains Jeff Callaghan. The restaurant’s Ocean Drive, he says, is the perfect transition between their signature cocktail menu and the new one they’re introducing, since the drink is based on the South Side, a cocktail best known for being gangster Al Capone’s favorite when he trafficked gin on Chicago’s South Side during Prohibition.\n\n“We call it Newport’s ‘South Side,’ a.k.a. Ocean Drive,” says Callaghan. Served in a tall, sleek glass with ice, the Ocean Drive is made by muddling fresh cucumber, mint and lime juice and combining it with Bimini gin, handcrafted in Maine using botanicals including hops, grapefruit zest and coriander seed.\n\n“It is completely refreshing and satisfying,” adds Callaghan. The Ocean Drive can be enjoyed anywhere at Fluke, but may we suggest the top floor with its long bar, natural hues and harbor view. Callaghan has just one warning about the cocktail: “You have to be careful not to have four of them,” he says with a chuckle.\n\nFluke Newport • 849-7778 • flukenewport.com\n\nNext best thing to a Caribbean getaway\n\nNewport’s maritime history combined with its robust regatta schedule makes our coastal community a hub for competitive sailors, and while these sailors know a lot about racing yachts, they also know a lot about rum.\n\nLifelong sailor Robert Flaxman and his wife, Leslie, bought The Reef in Newport at the beginning of 2020 — just about the worst time to jump into the hospitality industry. They used the downtime of the pandemic to completely rebuild the waterfront bar and restaurant and create new food and beverage menus, reopening this spring with an island vibe that includes Newport’s only palm tree grove.\n\n“Our cocktail menu this summer is trying to encompass a lot of different flavors from different ports around the world,” says Justin Ferland, The Reef’s director of operations. “We’re making drinks that are light, refreshing and patio-driven.”\n\nBest beaches this summer: A guide to the best Newport County beaches for swimming, sunbathing, walking\n\nThe must-have? The Caribbean Passion. It starts with Mount Gay Eclipse Rum, made by the oldest continuously operating commercial rum producer in the world. (Eclipse is aged up to two years in former bourbon barrels.) Balancing the savory is the sweet: the cocktail features equal parts passionfruit, orange and guava juices finished with about a quarter ounce of Coco López, a cream of coconut. An orange slice garnish provides the final fruity touch. “It’s not one of our boozier cocktails, so to speak,” Ferland concedes. “But it’s something that brings everyone right to the Caribbean; right into vacation mode.”\n\nThe Reef • 324-5852 • www.thereefnewport.com\n\nBest reason to channel your inner Jimi Hendrix\n\nWant some live music with that cocktail?: Here's where you can hear live music all summer long in Newport\n\nA carnival-style illuminated sign that reads \"FUN\" glows outside Stoneacre Garden, with an arrow pointing to the entry. It’s not just a sign, it’s a promise. With its whimsical circus-colored canopy shading the back patio and refreshing Narragansett Bay breeze wafting throughout the restaurant, the setting puts you instantly at ease.\n\nAnd the Purple Haze will take that state of mind to the next level. Served in a dramatic stemmed coupe, the purple concoction is topped with an egg white froth and garnished with an edible purple flower. It’s the kind of drink that instantly turns heads.\n\n“I really wanted to introduce umeshu, which is a Japanese plum wine, to one of our drinks on the menu,” says head bartender Simion Rusu. The base of the cocktail is mezcal, an agave spirit made in Mexico, which is juxtaposed with the fresh flavors of hibiscus and rhubarb. “It’s a very easy drink to enjoy,” says Rusu. “It’s super pleasant and refreshing, even though it has the twist of a sour cocktail.”\n\nStoneacre Garden • 619-8400 • stoneacregarden.com\n\nBest history lesson in a glass\n\nWhen cocoa supplies were low following World War II, an Italian pastry maker created a sweet paste made from sugar, hazelnuts and whatever cocoa he could find. The result? Nutella. So when Joe Murphy and business partners Michael “Sully” Sullivan and wife Reada Evans opened the Gulf Stream Bar and Grille at Portsmouth's East Passage Yachting Center, he saw an opportunity to marry the restaurant’s tropical vibe with one of his favorite indulgences.\n\n“I’ve always love Nutella and was looking for a way to incorporate it into a drink,” says Murphy. The Mudslide, invented at the Wreck Bar in the Rum Point Club on Grand Cayman Island in the 1950s, was an obvious cocktail choice. Yet Murphy sought to make a “remix” of the frozen classic and the Nutella Mudslide was born.\n\n“I was able to take the Nutella and make it into a syrup, render it down a little bit, and make it so it clings to the glass and into the drink,” explains Murphy. “Then you’re adding your vanilla vodka and your coffee liqueur and your Bailey’s to give it that nice little subtle twist.”\n\nIn summer, the Gulf Stream Bar and Grille can hardly keep up with demand for these frosty refreshers, and it’s not hard to see why. Chocolatey Nutella cascading down the inside of a pint glass, hints of cocoa in the Bailey’s Irish Cream and a boozy layer of vanilla vodka make for a delectable treat as you watch the boats bob in the marina. Murphy says that of the frozen drinks they offer, Nutella Mudslide is their best seller — and it’s not going anywhere. “It is the one drink that’s been there from the start and will never come off the menu.”\n\nGulf Stream Bar and Grille • 293-0930 • gulfstreambar.com\n\nBest excuse not to cross the Newport/Middletown Border\n\nYou don’t have to look hard to find a local who defiantly declares they “won’t set foot downtown until after Labor Day.” While we can’t endorse such a practice, Diego’s Barrio Cantina’s It’s Always Sunny in Middletown makes a good case for staying put. Muddled strawberry, cucumber and mint harmonize with Prairie gin’s burst of sage, juniper and other subtle herbs and spices.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! The bitter Italian aperitif Aperol, which for a century has gotten its signature orange hue from rhubarb and other ingredients, is added to the cocktail shaker along with fresh lemon juice. After a vigorous shaking, the punchy potion is poured over ice and served. *Best enjoyed on the cantina’s back deck overlooking Easton’s Pond.

Colorful, creative and zero proof, mocktails are as alluring as their spirits-infused counterparts. But these buzz-free bevvies let you sip all day and remain ready to play.\n\n“The visual perception of a mocktail is almost as important as its taste, because the person that’s drinking the mocktail wants to be included,” explains Kevin Ludy, restaurant manager and beverage coordinator at OceanCliff’s Safari Room Restaurant in Newport.\n\nBut the spoils of summer, including fresh fruit, berries and herbs, he says, make creating craft mocktails a delight. To please the palates of teetotalers, Ludy invented the Aesop, named for the Greek storyteller credited with Aesop’s Fables. Double-brewed hibiscus tea is combined with double-brewed rooibos tea, a South African herbal tea, then mixed with fresh-squeezed lemon juice and shaken vigorously.\n\n“And then I top it off with ginger beer, which gives a little bit of spice and a little bit of salty,” Ludy says. Despite what the name may suggest, ginger beer is a fermented but nonalcoholic beverage. The mocktail is also caffeine-free, so it’s a favorite of couples who are expecting. Garnished with a lemon wedge and served in a frozen pint glass, the Aesop is especially refreshing when enjoyed in an Adirondack chair on the Safari Room’s sprawling lawn overlooking Narragansett Bay.\n\nSafari Room Restaurant • 849-4873 • newportexperience.com/dine", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/good-news/2024/06/27/frozen-lemonade-is-a-rhode-island-specialty-dels-palagis-mr-lemon/73672303007/", "title": "Frozen lemonade is a Rhode Island specialty: Del's, Palagis, Mr ...", "text": "Hot, humid, sweltering. It's so hot, you think you're going to melt, or maybe you already melted.\n\nBut then you hear the jingle, you spot the stand, you see the green umbrella, and Rhode Island's favorite tart treat is in sight: frozen lemonade.\n\nRhode Island's love affair with frozen lemonade is old – older than anyone alive in the state – with Del's Lemonade dating back to the winter of 1840 in Naples, Italy, and the Palagis tracing its roots back to horse-drawn carriages selling sweet frozen treats.\n\nOne former rival to Del's, Mr. Nick's in North Providence, which has since closed, came directly from Italy, as owner Nick Africo emigrated to the United States from Sicily when he was 16, telling The Providence Journal-Bulletin that he \"grew up on the stuff.\" In Italy, it is known as \"granita di limone,\" or, literally, \"crushed ice of lemon.\"\n\nIt's not the state drink, but in summer it may as well be\n\nFrozen lemonade is not the state drink, losing out to coffee milk in what was dubbed the Great State House Drink Battle of 1993, a fight that made its way to the front page of The Wall Street Journal, but in summer, it may as well be. In 1982,The Providence Journal-Bulletin estimated an average of six cups of frozen lemonade were consumed per Rhode Islander per year.\n\nAnd how do you consume frozen lemonade?\n\nWith Del's, using a straw is pure sacrilege. Del's research and development head, Demetri Kazantzis, puts it this way: grasp the paper cup with the palm of your hand, which will warm the drink slightly, making it easier to drink. Part of it is the frozen feeling, lips hitting ice crystals, especially on a hot summer day.\n\nDel's Lemonade\n\nThe story of Del's Lemonade starts in 1840 in Naples, Italy, where lemons overwintered in a cave and were then mixed with sugar and snow to be sold at the local market.\n\nWhile the Del's recipe dates back to the 19th century, it was brought over the Atlantic at the turn of the 20th century, where Angelo DeLucia worked to build a machine that would produce consistent frozen lemonade.\n\nBy 1948, Del's Frozen Lemonade had its name and was the only thing being sold at its Cranston stand. DeLucia also designed the first mobile units that extended the company's reach.\n\nSince then, the company has grown, expanding its reach across the country with franchise locations in five states, creating a powdered drink mix and lots of collaborations, like Narragansett Beer's shandy, Warwick Ice Cream's lemon ice cream and Li'l Dinghy Drinks' canned cocktail, the Lemon Drop.\n\nWhere: Del's has 23 permanent locations in Rhode Island, with more carts and stands across the state, including at the state-run Scarborough Beach in Narragansett.\n\nPalagi Brothers Ice Cream and Palagis Ice Cream\n\nThe story of the Palagis and their ice cream trucks started, like Del's Lemonade, in Italy. Two brothers, Antonio and Pietro, emigrated to Pawtucket. Each started his own ice cream businesses, using horse and wagon to cart their wares, before upgrading to a Model A Ford, then a Ford Woody Wagon, and a fleet of modern ice cream trucks in the 1980s.\n\nFrozen lemonade entered the picture when machines came on the market to keep everything frozen and mixed.\n\nThe parallel but family-owned businesses continued until 1998, when one of the two, Palagis Ice Cream, was sold to Alejandro Arteaga, while the other Palagi ice cream company, Palagi Brothers Ice Cream, is operated by Adam and Robert Palagi.\n\nPalagis Ice Cream has a physical shack at 55 Bacon St. in Pawtucket and runs ice cream trucks, which also sell frozen lemonade. Palagi Brothers Ice Cream just runs trucks. Much of the business has transitioned from designated routes to serving events.\n\nWhere: Palagis Ice Cream has a stand at 55 Bacon St. in Pawtucket. Both companies run trucks throughout the state. Trucks can be requested to serve events and gatherings.\n\nMr. Lemon\n\nIn 1974, Eileen Rao and her husband, Joseph Rao Sr., founded Mr. Lemon in a small storefront on Hawkins Street in Providence.\n\nShe died in December 2023, at age 94; her husband had died in 1986. When the business opened, she and her husband had no experience with making frozen lemonade and \"toiled endlessly perfecting their product by trial and error,\" her obituary stated. Rao's three children – Janice, Colleen and Joseph Jr. – have handled the day-to-day work of running the store in recent years; their mother remained closely involved until her death.\n\nThe cash-only stand is known for offering a rotating variety of unique flavors such as tutti frutti, lemon meringue, vanilla, root beer and Creamsicle, alongside the classic lemon.\n\nThe family-owned frozen lemonade shack cut down its hours to weekends only, noon to 7 p.m., in 2023.\n\nWhere:32 Hawkins St., Providence\n\nNew England Frozen Lemonade\n\nNew England Frozen Lemonade was started by Tony Lombardi, one of Del's Lemonade's first drivers, before he bought a slush maker and truck, rented a storefront and went out on his own in the 1960s.

Many communities call Arizona home, including more than 20 different Native American tribes, immigrants from around the world and out-of-state transplants chasing the sun. All together, they have shaped Arizona's vibrant blend of Southwestern cuisine.\n\nIn larger cities, you will find a wonderland of international restaurants serving everything from Peruvian ceviche to Jamaican braised oxtail and Korean corn dogs. Phoenix is also peppered with regional chain restaurants from around the country, such as a famed Chicago chicken shack and outposts of a beloved New York City food cart. Chefs at fine dining restaurants are exploring new ways to celebrate local ingredients and are earning national acclaim in the process.\n\nAmid all of these exciting dining options, there are a few dishes that remain quintessentially Arizonan, for residents and visitors alike. From Navajo fry bread to prickly pear margaritas, chimichangas to Sonoran hot dogs, these 10 dishes are essential Arizona eats.\n\nBurritos\n\nArizona burritos are a meaty treasure. Unlike the Mission-style burritos you’ll find in a place like Chipotle or at many burrito shops in California, ours keep it simple with just a scoop of meat, like carne asada, carnitas or spiced pork adobada, and perhaps a little cheese or guacamole wrapped in a fresh flour tortilla. You won't find rice, sour cream, lettuce or other ingredients packed in, because Arizona burritos kick-it old school, reflecting the ones brought from the northern Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua in the 1900s by migrant farmworkers who needed a protein-packed, filling meal to get them through a hard day of work. Try one from any of our 24-hour Mexican joints, like Filiberto’s or its counterparts, Riliberto’s, Aliberto's or Los Betos. Just make sure you're hungry. And don't forget to order a side of hot salsa.\n\n— Andi Berlin\n\nEat more burritos: 3 must-try burritos at Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix\n\nChimichangas\n\nGood things happen when you take a burrito and deep fry it. A crispy-fried tortilla surrounding chopped or shredded meat is a central part of the menu at most sit-down Mexican restaurants in the state. The chimichanga's contested origin story just feeds into the lore of the dish. It’s true that it may have been invented in Mexico, where it’s about the size of an egg roll or a flat square that’s topped with mayonnaise and chopped tomatoes, but several Arizona restaurants also lay claim to its creation, including Phoenix-based Macayo’s and the historic El Charro Café in Tucson. As the story goes at El Charro, founder Monica Flin accidentally dropped a burrito into the fryer one day and began to mutter a famous Mexican curse word. No matter where it came from, the Arizona chimichanga is now a local staple, especially when it’s smothered in red or green chile sauce.\n\n— Andi Berlin\n\nSonoran hot dogs\n\nThe Sonoran dog is Arizona’s answer to New York and Chicago dogs. Wrapped in bacon and the bun stuffed with pinto beans, onions, tomato, mayo, mustard and jalapeño salsa, the Sonoran dog is a fusion of American pork products with vibrant Mexican flavors. Originally invented in Sonora’s capital of Hermosillo where they were sold at baseball games, the dogs made it up to Arizona in the ‘90s and were popularized by competing Tucson vendors El Güero Canelo and BK. In 2018, El Güero Canelo made history by receiving a coveted James Beard Award in the America’s Classics category, solidifying the hot dog’s iconic status. While the recipe can be tweaked with add-ons like Hot Cheetos and nacho cheese, the best Sonoran dogs tend to be traditional ones found at roadside carts in most Arizona cities. They’re even better when they come with a toasted yellow chile güero and a green bulb onion on the side.\n\n— Andi Berlin\n\nEegee's\n\nEegee's is a Tucson-based chain of sandwich shops known for its icy fruit drinks that go by the same name. The texture of an Eegee is a cross between a slushy and an Italian ice, but the flavors can get more creative with lemon, strawberry and piña colada options along with the ever-changing \"flavors of the month\" that have included the likes of mango tango, orange dream and galactic grape. The name is a combination of the initials of founders Edmund Irving and Robert Greenberg, who started selling their iced creations from a food truck in the early ’70s. Today, Eegee’s has dozens of locations across Tucson and Casa Grande, and recently opened a Valley location in Gilbert.\n\n— Andi Berlin\n\nI might get banned from Tucson, but I have to say it: I don't love Eegee's. Here's why\n\nTequila sunrise\n\nAlthough Mick Jagger popularized the tequila sunrise on the Rolling Stones’ 1972 tour, a fun fact that many may not realize is that the tequila sunrise cocktail was reportedly created right here in Phoenix many years earlier. According to the story, in the 1940s, bartender Gene Sulit worked at the Wright Bar inside the Arizona Biltmore Resort. When a customer asked for a refreshing tequila cocktail to beat the Arizona heat, Sulit mixed up a colorful cocktail with gradient colors, like a sunrise, hence the name. The original tequila sunrise had no orange juice or grenadine in sight; instead, the cocktail was made with black currant liqueur crème de cassis mixed with tequila, lime, ice and soda water. The classic is still available at the Arizona Biltmore resort bars and swimming pools where guests can sip a tequila sunrise poolside.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nHistory in a glass: The Arizona bar where the tequila sunrise was invented\n\nCheese crisps\n\nCheese crisps are widely acknowledged to have been created in Arizona. The bar snack consists of a flour tortilla sprinkled with shredded cheese and griddled until crispy. It can be served as is or spruced up with onions, chiles or other toppings before being sliced to share. One classic option includes strips of green chile spread out in a star pattern across the melty cheese. Their exact point of origin is disputed, but likely contenders include El Charro Café Mexican restaurant in Tucson and Macayo's Mexican Food in Phoenix. Teepee Mexican food, an old school Phoenix spot with a storied history of its own, offers three different versions.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nClassic Phoenix: The untold history of legendary Tee Pee Mexican Food\n\nPrickly Pear\n\nLittle stands at the airport are filled with bright boxes of prickly pear candy and bottles of luminescent pink syrup, as the sweet cactus fruit has become synonymous with desert vacations. And while the candies can be a treat, most locals forgo them in favor of prickly pear drinks from sour beers to fuchsia cocktails. Many restaurants serve hot pink prickly pear lemonade, a refreshing summer sipper, and for those looking to add a little agave to their Southwestern drink, prickly pear margaritas are a favorite at Mexican restaurants. Look for the golf ball sized purple fruits, called tunas, at farmers markets and grocery stores from late summer through early winter.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nNavajo Tacos\n\nA typical Navajo taco — also called Indian taco — swaps tortillas for fry bread, and is then layered with beans or bean chili and topped with ground beef, lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese. Though not exclusive to Diné people, these tacos are a staple at fundraisers, powwows and roadside stands for Arizona's Indigenous communities. One spot on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is even called The Stand. Fry bread itself is an iconic food — a golden-brown flat bread that's fluffy on the inside, and fried crisp on the outside. But it's also a food born from trauma and one with which some Indigenous people have a complicated relationship. In the mid-1800s, the U.S. forced Diné people from present-day Arizona to walk 300 miles into present-day eastern New Mexico, where they had to live on land where they couldn't grow their traditional crops. The government instead left them with flour, sugar, salt and lard, ingredients that would later be used to create fry bread.\n\n— Priscilla Totiyapungprasert\n\nMesquite flour\n\nMesquite pods were a food source for centuries for Indigenous people in the Southwest, who ground them into flour. The long, flat legumes grow on mesquite trees native to Arizona’s deserts. They’re ready to harvest when they ripen to yellow in the summer and can be milled into a sweet and nutty flour, used for everything from pancakes to pasta. While it's an uncommon pantry item nowadays, local chefs and bakers are finding new ways to use the mesquite flour. Perhaps most famous are the mesquite chocolate chip cookies from Scottsdale bakery Super Chunk Sweets & Treats, which have won local and national awards.\n\n— Priscilla Totiyapungprasert\n\nOriginal Chopped Salad\n\nSometimes described as the unofficial “state salad,” the Original Chopped Salad has a cult following among food enthusiasts in metro Phoenix. It consists of chopped arugula, smoked salmon, pearl couscous, pepitas, asiago cheese, dried sweet corn, marinated Roma tomatoes and buttermilk herb dressing. It was popularized at least 20 years ago at the now-defunct Old Town Scottsdale restaurant Cowboy Ciao, where it was known as the Stetson Chopped Salad. A 1984 article from The Arizona Republic mentions an even earlier iteration served at Steven, another now-closed Scottsdale restaurant. Chef Bernie Kantak updated the dish while working at Cowboy Ciao, and now the Original Chopped Salad (or variations of it) can be found on menus around the Valley.\n\n— Priscilla Totiyapungprasert\n\nReach reporter Andi Berlin at amberlin@azcentral.com or 602-444-8533.

As clear as the moonshine whose moniker it borrowed, this Dew tasted like today's 7Up or Sprite.\n\nYears later, when Mountain Dew began tasting like today's Mountain Dew, it was first called lemonade and sold in a clear bottle.\n\nTurning a Knoxville whiskey mixer into a soft drink to \"tickle yore innards\" took mixology magic, business savvy and a marketing campaign filled with gun-toting, jug-swigging barefoot Appalachian hillbillies.\n\nWhy do millions love Mountain Dew?\n\nToday Mountain Dew is marketed as a high-energy, high-performing beverage favored by, among others, extreme-sports athletes and race car drivers.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nBut whatever its image - from barefoot mountaineers to adventuresome snowboarders — Mountain Dew sells. Industry statistics show it's the third most popular “liquid refreshment brand\" behind Coca-Cola and its PepsiCo parent's Pepsi.\n\nA new exhibit at the Museum of East Tennessee History, 601 S. Gay St., traces Mountain Dew's regional roots and cultural connections. “It’ll Tickle Yore Innards!”: A (Hillbilly) History of Mountain Dew\" runs through Jan. 20.\n\n\"I think there is certainly something addictive to it, right?\" Adam Alfrey, the East Tennessee History Center's operations manager and senior curator, said about the drink's popularity. \"But I also think they (Mountain Dew owners) have been very smart to shift their marketing at the right times.\"\n\nHave bourbon, need mixer\n\nMountain Dew started because Knoxville brothers Barney and Ally (pronounced Ollie) Hartman needed the right mixer for their whiskey.\n\nThe Hartmans managed an Orange-Crush bottling plant in Augusta, Georgia, shortly after World War I. The sons of German immigrants, they enjoyed an after-work drink of Old Taylor Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey mixed with the highly carbonated lemon-lime soft drink Natural Setup. Natural Setup advertised itself as \"delicious, sparkling, healthful\" though its label included a pair of dice.\n\nWhen the Orange-Crush plant went bankrupt in 1932, the Hartmans moved to Knoxville to help operate a plant at 1921 Magnolia Ave. Smart businessmen who'd seen one plant fail, they diversified.\n\nThey sold beer the minute Prohibition ended in 1933 and began selling Pepsi in 1934. As beer and Pepsi sold well, they dropped Orange-Crush and became the Hartman Beverage Company.\n\nMore:The surprising moonshine history of Mountain Dew\n\nBut one of their favorites — Natural Setup — wasn't sold in Knoxville. In the 1940s, the Hartmans set out to make their own version, mostly to mix with liquor.\n\nThey asked Tip Corporation's master flavor mixer William Henry \"Billy\" Jones of Marion, Virginia to formulate the right concentrate for the non-alcoholic, carbonated beverage. The brothers occasionally bottled a few dozen cases of \"Personal Setup\" for themselves, employees and friends.\n\nThey weren't the first in Knoxville to make a carbonated dew. Twenty years before, Hungarian immigrant Max Licht briefly bottled \"Dew\" drinks in eight-ounce bottles shaped like barrels. Selling for a nickel, Licht's flavors included Grape Dew, Strawberry Dew and a \"sparkling white pure lemon\" Mountain Dew.\n\nThe Hartmans' Personal Setup was clear with a lemon-lime flavor like 7Up or today's Sprite. One employee joked it was as good as \"mountain dew\" because, when mixed with liquor, it tasted like a fine moonshine.\n\nAs time went by, it would be that joke of a name, not the drink's flavor, that would last.\n\nYahoo! Mountain Dew!\n\nTheir \"mountain dew\" was such a hit among friends and family, the Hartmans decided to go public. They debuted Mountain Dew, in deep green bottles, at a 1946 Gatlinburg bottling convention.\n\nThe bottles' paper labels depicted a barefoot, overalls-clad hillbilly holding a rifle in one hand and a jug of moonshine in the other. Drawn by Hartman neighbor and high schooler John Brichetto, the label implied the brothers “hand-brewed\" the dew in a clandestine still.\n\nMore:The deadly danger of \"dewshine\"\n\nMountain Dew's strategy rode the time's popular wave of Appalachian hillbilly marketing, Alfrey said. With taglines like \"Yahoo!\" and \"It'll tickle yore innards,\" the soft drink Mountain Dew built on the hillbilly image of the mid-20th century. Its hillbilly character \"Grandpappy\" was shown on later bottles shooting at a government revenuer running from an outhouse.\n\nImage great, contents blah\n\nThe Hartmans loved their lemon-lime Mountain Dew. The public didn't. \"It never really got off the ground,\" Alfrey said.\n\nIt'd take the Tri-City Beverage company - and a new taste - to make Mountain Dew a hit. The Johnson City firm loved the drink's green bottle and hillbilly imagery and got a franchise to make it. But their customers weren't any keener on that lemon-lime flavor than those in Knoxville.\n\nTri-City had Billy Jones — the man who created the Hartmans' \"Mountain Dew\" — make a lemonade-citrus soft drink in 1958. Loaded with caffeine and sugar, the drink was called Tri-City Lemonade.\n\nIn 1960, Tri-City manager Bill Bridgforth decided to bottle what was Tri-City in Mountain Dew's green hillbilly-labeled bottles. He renamed the drink the \"new\" Mountain Dew.\n\nGone was the Hartmans' original lemon-lime drink. Gone was Tri-City Lemonade.\n\nSales soared. \"Kids loved it,\" Alfrey said. Mountain Dew began to compete with the similarly flavored Sundrop and inspired the 1979 creation of Mello Yello.\n\n'Frankly hillbilly appeal'\n\nIn 1964, Pepsi bought Mountain Dew and the Tip Corporation. Pepsi officials loved what one executive called the beverage's \"frankly hillbilly appeal.\" For a few years, the company built on that image.\n\nA larger \"hillbilly\" cabin was built in New York's Waldorf-Astoria ballroom during Pepsi-Cola's 1964 bottling convention. There \"Daisy Mae\" offered samples of Mountain Dew's \"mountain elixir.\"\n\nAs the 1970s begin, Pepsi dropped hillbillies but kept their bare feet. It switched Mountain Dew marketing to a \"Get That Barefoot Feeling\" campaign aimed at urban teens. Over the decades, Mountain Dew has changed its logo and its market strategy into today's swirl logo.\n\nThe museum exhibit melts the history of corn whiskey \"mountain dew\" with the carbonated \"Mountain Dew.\" Artifacts include whiskey jugs from Knoxville saloons to an array of Mountain Dew bottles designed over the years to a promotional Granpappy doll. A loop of commercials illustrates how Mountain Dew's been sold through the decades. Among the spots - how to promote the drink with Pepsi's Doritos chips.\n\nThe Mountain Dew items in \"It'll Tickle Yore Innards\" were gifted the museum by Dick Bridgforth of Texas. Son of the late Bill Bridgforth, Bridgforth wrote the book \"Mountain Dew: The History.\"\n\n\"It'll Tickle Yore Innards\" is one of two Mountain Dew-dedicated East Tennessee displays this summer.

Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nRevel Public House, Palm Springs\n\nIn downtown Palm Springs, Alicante was beloved for its happy hour sangria and Spanish-style tapas. But the sister restaurant to Zin American Bistro has since been replaced with a new endeavor by owner Mindy Reed: Revel Public House.\n\nBilled as \"a Palm Springs gathering place,\" the pub offers burgers, pizza and skewers, plus beers on draft that include selections from its own Palm Springs Brewing Co., made exclusively in San Marcos.\n\nIf you're feeling eggy, you can grab breakfast – think omelettes and French toast. And those who have become accustomed to Reed's award-winning wine lists don't have to worry: There's more than 30 types of vino to complement over 15 bourbons, according to the restaurant's website.\n\nLa Quinta Brewing Co., Palm Springs\n\nLa Quinta Brewing Co. now has a taproom in Palm Springs – its third in the valley since opening in 2013. The taproom – with at least 20 varieties on tap – had a soft opening Friday at 300 N. Palm Canyon Drive, Suite 101, and offers seating inside and outside on a covered patio.\n\nDepending on the time of year, 10 to 14 of the taps serve what La Quinta Brewing makes and the rest are guest handles, featuring beer from all over the country, not just California, Lloyd said. The taprooms do not serve food, but staff encourages outside food to be brought in.\n\nThe microbrewery was founded in November 2013 by Scott Stokes, a home-brewing hobbyist and Coachella Valley native, who teamed with Lloyd and Ryan Pearson to create his dream business.\n\nThe beer is also served in more than 175 bars and restaurants in the Coachella Valley area. The company’s Poolside Blonde, Even Par 7.2 IPA and Koffi Porter are also available at retailers throughout the valley.\n\nPaul Bar, Palm Springs\n\nIf you've driven down Gene Autry Trail toward Interstate 10, you've probably passed by Sosa's Plaza without a second glance. The grungy strip mall on East Vista Chino in Palm Springs isn't exactly ... attractive. But a new sign just went up between the smoke shop and a cannabis dispensary. It reads \"Bar/Food,\" and has locals descending in droves.\n\nIt's partly the East Coast ambiance: plush beige bar stools, Asian artwork, walls painted in Manhattan blue, and an ornate mahogany bar with mirrored back. But it's more so the classic cocktails. There are no bells and whistles – just straight-forward Manhattans, Negronis, and vodka or gin martinis made right. Patrons are flocking for the boozy, frozen Sidecars, churned out by a margarita machine. Others are stopping in for the CosmoPaul, a non-sweet, dusty rose masterpiece served with a lemon twist.\n\nThe good news is you probably won't go broke at this new hot spot. Happy hour prices include $6 well drinks, $8 specialties and that $7 frozen Sidecar. (There's also wine and draft beer.) Plus, the food's affordable. There are big plates like a $12 burger with garlic bacon aioli as well as sides like $10 Jersey-style calamari, $6 French fries and an $8 grilled cheese made with bacon and Fontina cheese on sourdough. Try the $10 pulled pork sandwich – it's juicy in all the right places.\n\nPink Cabana, Indian Wells\n\nAs the name suggests, the exterior of the Pink Cabana is the same Desert Rose shade as the rest of The Sands Hotel & Spa. And when you walk inside the restaurant, the color palette continues on the ceiling, the napkins, the booth cushions and the cocktails – there's the Pink Lemonade and 50 Shades of Pink.\n\nThe décor, by Martyn Lawrence Bullard, designer to the stars, is a nod to the mid-century tennis and racquet clubs with old-school racquets mounted on the wall with vintage photos of people playing tennis. A green and white leaf-patterned wall paper and wicker-backed chairs provide a hint of tiki, while the low-back brass bar stools and brass bar shelves further push the retro aesthetic that is so popular in the desert.\n\nWith a background in modern French and Mediterranean, executive chef Jason Niederkorn was excited to incorporate both styles into the menu which includes everything from house-made naan with hummus and tagine of beef shortrib to fritto misto and moules frites. The cocktail program is ingredient driven with a handpicked wine list to enhance the food. There's classic cocktails like a mojito, an old fashioned and a colada, but all with unique ingredients and surprises. The Cabana Colada for example, has coconut in it, but they use real coconut cream in addition to a coconut soda so it’s a lot lighter and brighter.\n\nThe Marlin Bar, Palm Springs\n\nThe first thing you might wonder when walking up to the new Tommy Bahama Marlin Bar & Grill in downtown Palm Springs is if you’re in the right place.\n\nDon’t worry, you are.\n\nThe reason it doesn’t resemble what you might be used to in Palm Desert or some of their other locations, is because it’s their newest dining concept and the first location of its kind in California. It looks like Tommy Bahama’s cooler, younger brother — if restaurants had siblings. And that’s not meant as a blow to the location in Palm Desert. It’s just that the new restaurant and bar in Palm Springs, which opened Tuesday, is more casual and affordable.\n\nThere is some seating indoors, but most of the tables are outdoors underneath or near huge umbrellas with misters. So, even if it’s the middle of the summer, you shouldn’t feel like you’re sizzling. Try the Lobster Mac & Cheese! Also of note are its fun tropical drinks: the Baja Margarita, the Cucumber Smash, Bahia Sangria – which can be ordered as a pitcher – and the Blood Orange Margarita.\n\nWhich Wich, Palm Desert\n\nJon and George Kasira have brought the area’s first Which Wich sandwich franchise – best known for its bag ordering system and variety of “Yummy Side Up” Eggwiches – to Palm Desert.\n\nCustomers can choose from a menu of Which Wich “favorites” or build their own sandwiches from a long list of ingredients – meats, vegetables, toppings and condiments. Which Wich is best known for its variety of “Yummy Side Up” Eggwiches – “the sandwich that drools back” – including the Bánh Mì, a soy glazed pulled pork sandwich inspired by the flavors of Vietnam.\n\nThere is also the Cheeseburgerwich – tender sirloin, smoked thick-cut bacon, American cheese, tomatoes, caramelized onions, pickles, toasted sesame seeds, special sauce and sunny side up egg on toasted baguette. Menus also include vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. For dessert or other cravings, the menu also includes milkshakes, cookies and other sweets.\n\nKreem, Palm Springs\n\nPalm Springs got a whole lot cooler. Kreem opened on East Palm Canyon Drive to offer gourmet coffee and ice cream just in time for the warmer weather.\n\nExpect coffee floats and fresh almond milk at owner Bianca Simonian’s mid-mod parlor. The Los Angeles transplant uses top quality organic dairy to make all her ice cream in house, complementing brews from Portland-based Heart Coffee Roasters.\n\nYou can savor flavors like s'mores, lemon meringue pie and Cookies & Kreem, as well as vegan options including chocolate cookie, Almond Joi and vanilla bean. You can purchase the ice cream by the pint in addition to various sizes served in a cup or waffle cone. (Plus, special \"Canine Cones\" will be offered for pooches!)\n\nAt the coffee station, you can add ice cream-inspired accompaniments like vanilla bean sugar to offerings that include cold brews, cappuccinos, lattes, hot chocolate/steamers and, of course, coffee floats. If you’re in the mood for something a bit heartier, try an ice cream sandwich with locally baked cookies. And don't forget to top off your selection with fresh vanilla bean and rose water syrup, caramel or chocolate sauce.\n\nAC3, Palm Desert\n\nAC3 Restaurant + Bar, owned by well-known valley restaurateurs Tony Marchese and Andrew and Juliana Copley opened this winter adjacent to Hotel Paseo in Palm Desert. Marchese owns TRIO in Palm Springs while Andrew and Juliana Copley own Copley’s, also in Palm Springs.\n\nAC3’s dinner menu highlights include Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes with wasabi guacamole, sweet and sour sauce and tobiko; Berkshire Pork Schnitzel with dijonaise crushed potatoes, bacon brussels sprouts, herbed yogurt and cranberry; Striped Sea Bass with black lentils, tinker bell peppers, dinosaur kale, mushrooms and smoked citrus butter; and Citrus Icebox Cake with yuzu cream, graham crust and basil ice cream.\n\nThe restaurant’s contemporary interior was designed and decorated by Monique Lemon and Angela Paladino of Design One Eleven in Indian Wells. It features paintings by local artist Nicholas Kontaxis.\n\nWildest Greens, Palm Desert\n\nThis organic-based restaurant offers cold-pressed juices and organic coffees, teas, beer, wine and house-made kombuchas. The menu features raw, vegan, gluten-free, paleo and macrobiotic items. Customers can indulge in “guilt-free” versions of burgers, pizzas, soups, and desserts, along with salads.\n\nYou will be hard-pressed to find any white sugar or white flour in the pastries.\n\nOwner Denise DuBarry Hay said her family has long focused on eating mindfully, and felt that there weren’t many options in the Palm Desert area to meet that need. She said she often was driving to Palm Springs to find a spread of organic dining options.\n\nThe restaurant has a café featuring wine, beer and homemade kombucha on tap, plus a refrigerator stocked with bottles of juice and nut milks. There is an area featuring salads, sandwiches, pizzas and wraps, as well as a smoothie bar. The shop also offers tonics, cleansers and shooters aimed at detoxifying the body and stimulate fat-burning.\n\nWexler's, Palm Springs\n\nOK so it's not opening this summer, but October can't come soon enough! Wexler’s, a popular classic Jewish deli that originated in Los Angeles, is expected to open this fall at Arrive hotel in Palm Springs, replacing the restaurant now known as Reservoir which will remain open through the summer.\n\nFounded by chef Micah Wexler and business partner Michael Kassar, Wexler’s Deli first opened in April 2014 at downtown L.A.’s historic Grand Central Market. Wexler’s menu features traditional Jewish deli favorites, including corned beef, pastrami, lox and sturgeon – all cured and smoked in-house using old-school methods – as well as house-made condiments and freshly baked breads and bagels.\n\nAt Arrive, Wexler’s will be serving breakfast, lunch and dinner from menus created specifically for this hotel location. Classic Wexler’s Deli items will be offered as well, including The McArthur Park and the double-smoked pastrami lox.\n\nKristin Scharkey is the editor of DESERT magazine and community content editor at The Desert Sun.

Owner Gabriel Mason replaced the former barbecue truck in September to launch the new endeavor.\n\nHis Texas-styled menu is built around top-sellers like his pulled pork and prime brisket plates, along with loaded Texas nachos topped with sour cream, hot sauce and jalapenos. He also offers some unique items others may not have tried, such as his blueberry chipotle sauce. He said he is also looking to bring weekly specials along with the daily menu.\n\nRead the full story: Texan B's BBQ food truck setting up stationary location on Woodbine Road in Pace\n\nTaqueria Catra-MEX\n\n4306 N. Davis Highway\n\nPensacola chef Edgar Peralta set out to prove that flavors of Honduran and Mexican cooking are a perfect pairing through his new fusion food truck, Taqueria Catra-MEX, 4306 North Davis Highway.\n\nDishes that may seem unusual at first, such as the mojarra frita, or a fried whole tilapia with rice, beans, salad and valentina sauce, are commonplace to him. The $13.99 plate can also be ordered \"Honduran style,\" which would substitute the rice for the plantains.\n\nOne of the most popular Mexican plates is the carne asada, Peralta said, made with roast beef and accompanied by rice, refried beans salad, tortillas, roasted onion and a toreado jalapeno for $13.50. But trending items, such as the birria tacos, are a close second.\n\nRead the full story: Taqueria Catra-MEX dishing up not just tacos, but authentic Mexican and Honduran cuisine\n\nSlim Chickens\n\n8006 Navarre Parkway, Navarre\n\nFor all the Navarre residents craving home-fried chicken on the run, Arkansas-born restaurant Slim Chickens opened its newest location Halloween day on 8006 Navarre Parkway. The Southern-style chicken joint prides itself on its fresh, 24-hour buttermilk-brined tenders that merited the company's name in 2003, accompanied by Southern sides like fried okra and 17 different sauces.\n\nMediterranean Table\n\nMobile food truck\n\nPensacola food truck owner Ali Kara doubles as an emergency medical technician and the owner of a Mediterranean food truck, The Mediterranean Table, which debuted in October. The menu is concise, offering three core items — the Casbah sub, chakchouka and fries, and chicken burger — along with one rotating special. There is also the option to add a side of hummus or fries to the order.\n\nThe chakchouka ($10), a blend of peppers, onions and tomatoes simmered down and served over a bed of fries, is particularly special to his family, Ali said, since Israel and Algeria are the only countries known to serve the dish. The Casbah sub ($8), a nod to one of the oldest cities in Algeria, is known for its street-food style. It is made with fresh ground beef mixed with Mediterranean spices, grilled with onions, eggs and American cheese. Even the seemingly Americanized chicken burger ($7) has its own twist and is infused with Mediterranean spices and made with freshly ground chicken as it would be in Algeria, where few foods are sold pre-sliced or processed.\n\nRead the full story: The Mediterranean Table food truck brings taste of Algeria outside Pensacola City Hall\n\nThe Handlebar\n\n319 N. Tarragona St.\n\nDebuted in 1983, The Handlebar became a hub for inexperienced but charismatic aspiring musicians to take the stage for the very first time and for seasoned local artists to cement their legacies as local legends. Handlebar General Manager Robert Goodspeed said the team plans to keep it a place for the local people to learn how to perform, but also attract big-name artists.

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

Yeah, it's the middle of July. yeah, Notre Dame football starts preseason camp in six days. But it's always a good time to circle back around to the Notre Dame men's basketball program, where the Micah Shrewsberry Era is live. Area media got a sneak peek at the program this week, and we're here to talk everything Irish hoops. To leave a question or comment, make sure you include your name and hometown. With that, you know the drill ... let's light this chat candle.\n\nMark from Rochester: Tom, thanks for doing this as always. How will the style of play change with Micah at the helm? Curious on the big differences if some are known at this point. Thanks!Thomas Noie: Mark: We're all curious about that. Notre Dame was it was the last few years - the same guys were going to do the same things in the same ways. They were going to play slow, they weren't always going to rebound or defend and they were going to play it relatively safe to overcome some athletic deficiencies. Don't expect that blueprint to carry over with Micah Shrewsberry. He'll play more guys, regardless of position, play faster and demand that his guys dig in a little more on the defensive end (though we saw no defensive drills during Tuesday's media viewing window). Like in the past, expect Notre Dame to shoot A LOT of 3s. It's where the game is. It's not about pounding it down low with two bigs and hammering teams. It's wide-open, free flowing. In that regard, they should be fun to watch, even if the wins don't arrive as quickly as some want/expect.\n\nAdam - St. Louis: Tom: Give us your early impressions on the way Shrews is recruiting. He seems a little more active than the previous staff? Any thoughts on current commits?Thomas Noie: Adam: Active and aggressive, especially in the state of Indiana and the Midwest. In getting to know the staff, expect the Midwest to be a heavy emphasis. I was struck by a comment assistant coach Ryan \"Ghost\" Owens made when I visited with him. He said the staff would be committing recruiting malpractice if they didn't look for players in Indiana and the immediate surrounding states. Notre Dame has only one commitment for 2024 - guard Cole Certa from Bloomington, Illinois. Certa was solid during the summer evaluation period and will play his senior year at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. He's a player. I'd expect a few more to join him as Shrewsberry and his staff figure out who fits the Notre Dame recruit profile.\n\nJim from Evanston: What has been the biggest positive change Shrewsberry has made to the program so far?Thomas Noie: Jim: It's a relatively small sample size because we've not seen THAT much of practices or been around those guys (still time for that) but I'd say in watching Tuesday it would be Shrewsberry's ability to communicate what he wants done and the way he teaches. He's already rolled up his sleeves and gone to work on the practice floor. The demands are high, but it's what this program needed. He's raised the bar, whether in the weight room or on the practice floor. In the past, it was players who held other players accountable - they kind of coached themselves. Now, though, the accountability starts with the head coach. It's understood what the expectations are from Shrewsberry on down. Different guy, different approach. Refreshing in that regard.\n\nJ.J. Post: If no other Portal additions are made and Markus Burton does end up the lone true point guard on the roster - whether he earns the starting designation or not, what are reasonable expectations for his freshman season?Thomas Noie: J.J.: If the season started tonight, Markus Burton is the starting point guard. He's actually the only true point guard on the roster, though there are certainly others who could swing over and handle in case of emergency. I don't think the roster is going past 10 this season. You get the feeling that Shrewsberry and the staff have their guys and their going to move forward with this group the way it is. Reasonable expectations? Be a solid point guard. Burton averaged 30 ppg., as a senior at Penn High School last winter. He won't average half of that next season, and doesn't have to. If he can get to double figures, fine, but it's more important (for now) that he confidently gets this team into their offense, takes care of the ball, defends, make the occasional open shot and maybe above all, plays with a confidence that carries over to other players. Shrewsberry knows Burton will make mistakes. It's part of the process. But stay confident through it, and believe that he belongs.\n\nJ.J. Post: Shrewsberry has continually preached playing a system that will fit the players on the roster rather than have any one consistent hallmark, something reflected by his willingness to play his unique 'bootyball' scheme at Penn State. Given the roster as constructed at present, what are some key elements you suspect his 2023 system will possess?Thomas Noie: J.J.: Hard to say, because we haven't seen enough of how the pieces fit. Based on what we did see on Tuesday, this team is going to shoot a lot of 3s. Everybody from Matt Zona to Markus Burton will have the green light to take that shot if it's a good shot. So there's that. Expect this offense to feature a lot of moving and cutting and screening and reading and reacting to what the defense is doing. Not run specific, regimented sets. The bigs are Matt Zona, Kebba Njie and Carey Booth. I don't know that they have a true post-up/back-to-the-basket presence. Njie could eventually be that, but it will be tough to pound it into the post given the size and athleticism that awaits in the Atlantic Coast Conference. It will be intriguing to see how the offense evolves as league play unfolds. It might be a struggle given the lack of size and experience. Shrewesberry will figure it out.\n\nGuest: In the near term, what rising high school players for 2024 recruitment is ND pursuing in addition to its one commitment in Certa.Thomas Noie: There's a core five of Sir Mohammed, CG, 6-6, 200, Charlotte, North Carolina, Jackson McAndrew, PF, 6-8, 190 Wayzata, Minnesota, Garrett Sundra, PF, 6-10, 215, Fairfax, Virginia, Trent Perry, CG, 6-4, 215 Studio City, California and Travis Perry (no relation), PG, 6-2, 170, Eddyville, Kentucky. How many scholarships Notre Dame will eventually have for the 2024 recruiting class (which already includes Cole Certa) remains to be determined. Notre Dame's roster currently carries 10 scholarship players, and all 10 are eligible to return next season. If that happens - and that's a big IF - Notre Dame would have only three spots (two with Certa committed) for the 2024 class.\n\nMatt,: Tom, with the staff finally set Shrews can really lock into recruiting. How many do you see bringing in the 2024 class.Thomas Noie: Matt: Kind of/sort of answered the question above (or below). Notre Dame has 10 scholarship players on the roster for 2023-24 and all 10 have eligibility remaining in some way, shape or form. Seniors Tony Sanders and Matt Zona have the COVID year to go. With Cold Certa committed, Notre Dame would have only two scholarships available. That might change as this season unfolds.\n\nMatt,: how many do you see him bringing in the next 2 classes?Thomas Noie: Matt: That's the $64,000 question that has no answer. Nobody can say because of what the immediate eligibility transfer rule has done to college basketball. Your roster is your roster but it's never really set. Nobody might leave come spring. Two players might leave. Or four. Nobody really knows, which makes it hard to plan for in a recruiting sense. Notre Dame had what, two guys enter the portal since it became the portal before last spring, when five guys bailed. It's impossible to tell.\n\nBanks Asleson: What Impact will Markus Burton have as a freshman? Will he start?Thomas Noie: Banks: As of today, he's the starting (and only true) point guard on the roster. He's going to play and play a lot. Don't expect him to post Indiana Mr. Basketball numbers as a freshman. As long as he can coordinate everything and take care of the ball and defend, it will be a successful season. He'd benefit from playing behind a veteran guard, just so he can learn the game, get stronger and kind of see everything from a patient perspective. That's probably not going to happen. It's going to be right into the fire of the ACC for Burton. Is he ready? There's no choice. He has to be.\n\nJon: Now that Brey is gone will more players get a chance to play. what's the new coaches take on playing more then six deep!! I liked the energy Matt Zona brought when given the minuscule chances (minutes) in games and then when given more than the 2 minutes at the end of games Sanders, Campbell and he usually got. Zona really showed his long range touch and strength down low the final two or three games.Thomas Noie: Jon: Micah Shrewsberry likely will play more guys this season, but that will be more out of necessity of not having a core four of veterans to lean on, which is what he did at Penn State. FOur Lions all started at least 33 games and played at least 28.2 minutes per game last season, so it wasn't that far off from Notre Dame's penchant for leaning on a veteran group. What was different was how Shrewsberry utilized his bench, where eight players all logged at least 10-plus minutes and 11 played at least eight-plus minutes with eight different players each logging at least four starts. Markus Burton is going to play. A lot. Same for Julian Roper and Kebba Njie. Maybe Matt Zona. Maybe J.R. Koniecnzy. It will look different in many ways; it might look the same in others.\n\nLinas from Orange County, CA: Hey Tom! Happy Summer. Curious about your take on these visits by potential transfers like Paul Mulcahy (can't get anymore Irish than that last name:) and Joe Gerard. Any sense from them why they didn't choose Notre Dame? Is it something to do academics/credits, or the fact that most don't expect an NCAA tournament bid from this young team, or something else? Also, considering Notre Dame's stellar academic reputation why someone like Chris Ledlum from Harvard wouldn't consider the Irish? Thanks for keeping the Irish talk going through the summerThomas Noie: Linas: Usually when you have guys like that who have been around the college basketball block, they're looking for something specific. Like NIL money. Or the chance to win. Mulcahy played in the NCAA tournament at Rutgers, so there's that. Would've been nice to have him (Girard, not so much) but getting a veteran grad transfer at this point was a really hard sell. Notre Dame is not expected to be very successful this season. If you have one more year and you want to win and you want to play in the NCAA tournament, you're probably not going to do it at Notre Dame next season.\n\nJET from Evansville: Who will b our best player?Thomas Noie: JET: How's this for some insight ... I have no idea. None. I didn't see enough of the Irish earlier this week that one or two guys jumped out and said, hey, keep an eye on me. I'm ready. If I had to guess, I'd say Kebba Njie in that he's played a season for Shrewsberry, he knows the system, he looks the part and he's going to get a big chance. Everyone else was just kind of OK. Nothing good. Nothing bad.\n\nBrian from Mishawaka: Coach ... Given your ties to IU-South Bend, can we expect a pre-season/exhibition game with the Titans this year? Coach Cooper has taken his team to the NAIAs for the past several seasons and they've won the CCAC championship a few times as well. Lots of fans on both sides would love to see this match-up!Thomas Noie: Brian: I'm sure Micah Shrewsberry loves the idea, but maybe a year or two down the road. Given how Notre Dame is complete rebuild mode, it's more important in November to play a game against competition that's going to challenge them more than IUSB would. Those kind of exhibition games are good for about a half or a half of a half, and then you get nothing out of them. That said, Notre Dame does plan to play a secret (shhhhh....don't tell anyone) scrimmage against Xavier (somewhere between here and Cincinnati, probably Indy). It would be good to play another secret scrimmage. This Irish team needs seasoning more than area fans need to see a local matchup. Keep that IUSB game on the back burner, though. Good call.\n\nJP, San Diego: Tom, first time long time. There is a ton of reason for optimism around Micah and the program. Namely a lot of strength and conditioning videos/clips on social this summer. We are tired of having our upperclassmen bullied physically in conference play. How archaic was the previous setup (still Rolinski/shared S/C coach with hockey?) and how much of a difference do you expect to see on the court with a dedicated S/C staff now in place?Thomas Noie: JP: You probably can't find five former players who would have anything negative to say about former strength and conditioning coach Tony Rolinski. Players absolutely loved the guy. He was tough but fair and was a sounding board away from the court for so many. Back when they used to run through a year-end banquet (thank God those days are over) every single senior who spoke shouted out T-Ro for helping them get through the tough times. That Rolinski split his time between sports (hoops and hockey) speaks more toward Notre Dame living in the dark ages of strength and conditioning. Hope to soon sit with new strength and conditioning coach Greg Miskinis for a deeper dive into what needs to change from that standpoint. Seeing him at work Tuesday, he's going to be good.\n\nJP, San Diego: Both potentially great players. Who will have a bigger impact on the program when we look back in ten years— Markus Burton or Carey Booth?Thomas Noie: JP: Great question. When it doubt, though, go with the local guy, right? The guy you've seen play in person a ton. The guy you know. The guy whose chip on the shoulder is deep. Burton was doubted at Penn the way he's going to be doubted at Notre Dame. He delivered in high school and has to do it again. Booth could be a future pro given his bloodlines, but I've not seen enough of him to say for certain that he's a can't-miss kid. If both develop and then flourish, Burton might be around Notre Dame more than Booth.\n\nMark Oliver: Hi Tom, Hope your summer is going well. I like the Micah hire obviously and it seems he'll get the program back on track, but it will be weird following a team this year where they are mostly all transfers and you know much about anybody. I know it's the new normal, but what can you tell me to help get me excited come September so I can sink my teeth into the new season and connect this mixed bags of guys with the Irish program. Thanks.Thomas Noie: Mark: So, you're asking me to put on my carnival barker hat ... step right up ladies and gentlemen, step right up and come and see the Irish men's basketball team, which will feature two locak guys (maybe both in the starting lineup), and a freshmen class that might be better than average in a few years. There's also fan favorite Matt Zona, who will do more than just sit and watch at the end of the bench. And there's Kebba Njie, who knows what elite college basketball is all about. If you're coming out to watch this team this season, you're not coming out to watch them win or chase a possible NCAA tournament bid. You're coming out to say you were on the ground floor when this program gets back to being good.\n\nDennis Huyvaert: Hi Tom , I cannot wait to see how Marcus Burton performs this year. Do you think he can has as big an impact his first year as Blake Wesley had ?Thomas Noie: Dennis: Whoa.....nothing like raising the bar of expectations my man. That's a big ask/expectation. Wesley led the team in scoring (14.4 ppg.). He played in all 35 games and made 28 starts. he averaged 29.4 minutes per game and was a second team all-Atlantic Coast Conference guy and all-rookie selection. He had an NBA-type of body (scrawny as it was) from the jump. He was one of the few who believed he could be a one-and-done (and then he was). Burton's a different kind of player and will be on a team that's not going to go 15-5 in the ACC and come within two minutes of getting to the Sweet 16. Burton has a chance to be good, but not that good. At least not right away.\n\nSteve Duff: Love the summer hoops talk! What are realistic expectations for this team in your opinion? With nearly all new faces - how do you even project? I’m cautiously optimistic, but there are just so many unknowns. Also who are the difference makers /playmakers on the squad outside of Markus Burton? Thanks for doing this Tom and keep up the great work!Thomas Noie: Steve: Everything about this program continues to be a blank slate. There are too many unknowns and too few knows. Like, really none. If this team can double its league win total and go 6-14, that's a step, right? It's hard to see how the parts fit and who will be the difference-makers. Markus Burton has a chance because he offers something the roster doesn't have. Kebba Njie could be good. Julian Roper is going to play because Micah Shrewsberry loves his toughness. Can Matt Zona carry over what he did in limited minutes in the last game of the season last year? It's going to be intriguing, that's for sure.\n\nTim from Chicago: Hi Tom, how would you grade the performance of Goodwin, Laz and Wesley in the recent NBA summer league?Thomas Noie: Tim: Incomplete for Dane Goodwin (Sacramento) and Nate Laszewski (Indiana). Not enough minutes to evaluate. They were longshots as it was. That Laszewski didn't make a 3 (0-for-9) kind of sealed his future fate (Europe). As for Blake Wesley, he had a massive opportunity as the starting point guard for San Antonio. He put up some nice numbers (12.8 ppg., 6.0 rpg., 3.0 apg., 29.1 mpg) but there were three red flags - his shooting percentages of 31.0 percent from the field (ugh), 21.4 percent from 3 (ugh) and 63.2 percent from the foul line (ugh). They say it's a make or miss league, and that's so true. If Blake Wesley's not long for the league, there will be no secret as to why it didn't work.\n\nMike: Hi Tom, slightly holding out hope that JR has a similar breakout year like Abro did coming off his Redshift season. Any thoughts on where he fits this year?Thomas Noie: If my six observations from this week's sneak peek at the program (https://tinyurl.com/msw6nktr) had run seven deep, No. 7 would've been something about J.R. Koniecnzy. Specifically, this is a big prove-it year for him. He barely played as a freshman and sat out last season to preserve a year of eligibility. How has that benefitted him? Did his game get better? Did he get stronger? He has a chance to start this season. How will he chase that? Will he? Micah Shrewsberry said Konieczny still needs to slow down a little bit - not everything can be the same speed. He's also seen him get more confident with his shot - something that wasn't the case when the new coach arrived. Play time for J.R. is over. It's time to deliver, and show (and show early) that those last two years weren't wasted.\n\nGuest: Tom…..can Shrews possibly win 10 games this year and how long will it take for a tournament bid?Thomas Noie: We've seen that anything is possible in college basketball today. Is it likely? This program's probably not winning 10 ACC games. Last year was a disaster of all disasters and Notre Dame still won 11 overall. I'd go with the over on 10, but not that far over.\n\nTony: Tom, have you seen Tony or Matt workout? I have seen pictures and both seem to be bigger/slimmer, stronger. I hope they both contribute!Thomas Noie: Tony: I'd go with Matt Zona having more of a role than Tony Sanders. It wouldn't be a surprise if Zona started (at least, to start). Sanders might be behind Konieczny and Tae Davis as a wing. It's hard to go that deep on the depth chart. Both will have opportunity to show more and do more than previous seasons, so the chance is there.\n\nIllinois Fool: Who can we expect to play the Point since Micah seems to have missed out on getting a veteran transfer? How much time would you guess Burton will play?Thomas Noie: IF: Right now, the job's Markus Burton's and only Burton's as the only true point guard on the roster. Micah Shrewsberry seemed pretty set as far back as May in terms of moving forward with this group as is, so I wouldn't say he \"missed out\" on a veteran point guard. I don't know how much he really wanted one. Or saw one that fit his plans.\n\nMike from Mount Holly: Is my assumption that the offense will struggle more than the defense a correct one? And what should fans expect to see defensively? Does Coach already know what sort of defensive setup this first ND team will be able to hang it's hat on?Thomas Noie: Mike: Defense? What is this concept of which you speak? We saw 30 minutes of work earlier this week, and not one minute of that time was devoted to defense. It was all about offense and movement and cutting and swinging the ball and making shots. What is this team going to be defensively? No idea. I don't know and I don't know that Micah Shrewesberry knows. This group hasn't even played five-on-five yet this summer so to say for sure that this group can do this and this and this well on defense, that's not the case. Not yet. They'll get there, though.\n\nJJ - Ft. Wayne: If you had to field a starting five tomorrow who would they be and who would be your first two off the bench?Thomas Noie: PG - Markus Burton; SG - Julian Roper WF - J.R. Konieczny PF - Kebba Njie, Matt Zona. Top reserves: Carey Booth, Tae Davis. Possible changes? Flip Davis for Koniecnzy and Booth for Zona.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, About a week ago, Norlander of CBS did a great piece on the hiring of Shrew. In this quote, he talked about Jack S. and the hiring process. \"This was to be his 28th (and likely final) head-coaching hire. He began by calling three shoot-for-the-moon candidatess, who all said no.\" Can you fill in the blanks? Part 2. The article talks about nearing the end of the process. \"Notre Dame was effectively down to two candidates by this stage and had an encouraging signal from its No. 2 that it would be a yes if Shrewsberry was a no.\" DeVries, Langel or a 3rd party?Thomas Noie: Joe: Let's go with Monty Williams, Brad Stevens and Jay Wright for question No. 1 and either Gregg McDermott or Chris Holtmann for question No. 2. Word as that search wound down was that DeVries and Langel weren't really as involved as many figured, for whatever reason. This really was a one-candidate process from the start. It was Shrewsberry from the start, Shrewsberry in the middle and Shrewsberry at the end. It really was that simple.\n\nRyan mars pa: Tom how has Matt Zona looked at open practice and how does the team look so far in open practice in the Micah Shrewsberry era go IrishThomas Noie: Ryan: Matt Zona has a chance to be a main guy this year. This team has a long, long way to go. They may not get there this year or next, but they'll get there.\n\nRyan Hoover fan: Tom is this the most off season enthusiasm you have seen for nd hoops in awhile?Thomas Noie: You mean since, let's see .... last summer? The previous year, Notre Dame had set a school record for most league wins (15), came within two minutes of getting to the Sweet 16 for the first time in six seasons, returned three veteran guys and had a talented freshman class that featured a McDonald's All-American on campus. That group - not us dopes in the media - talked as late as October of winning the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championship and getting to an NCAA Final Four. There was plenty of enthusiasm for where last season could go, before it all historically fell apart to the point where the winningest coach in program history said, forget this, I'm out. There's enthusiasm, sure, but it's more about what this program can eventually become under Micah Shrewsberry, even though that might not be until four, five years down the basketball road.\n\nTom from Jersey shore: Tom thanks for the summer basketball chat. Do you know when the full schedule is being released or have you heard any other games besides Marquette, G-Town and South CarolinaThomas Noie: Tom: Get off the chat and get to the shore, my man....come on! I kid....it will be some time before the full schedule is released - it usually doesn't happen until around Labor Day. Notre Dame might be close to releasing its non-league slate soon, and we could hear the home-only and road-only and repeat opponents in the Atlantic Coast Conference will be, but dates won't be finalized for a few more months. As for non-league, Notre Dame is at Marquette and at South Carolina.\n\nNathan- South Bend: Do you see Tony Sanders playing at all this year? considering other than maybe a little his freshman year, I don't remember him playing much, if at all. we don't really know what he can doThomas Noie: Nathan: Everything - and everybody - is on the playing-time table. They have to be with so few experienced guys who've never gone through the grind of a season. Tony Sanders is right there with J.R. Konieczny and Matt Zona - guys who barely have played, but who now have a chance to hit the reset button and show the staff that they deserve a longer look.\n\nPaul R: I know this team is very young and inexperienced compared to last years group, but is it reasonable to believe they could win more conference games this year?Thomas Noie: Paul: At the very least, Notre Dame should be better than 3-17 in the league. Even if it's an average - or below average - team, it has to be better than 3-7 at home in league play as it was last year. And 0-10 on the road? Speaks to how this team just kind of collectively quit to go winless away from home. Even a bad team can scratch out at least one win somewhere away from home in league play. So yeah, better than 3-17 in the league this season, for sure.\n\nAidan: How do you see Carey Booth fitting in this year. As he has the highest ceiling on the team but also is very raw coming out of high-school. So does he get thrown in early and see how he plays or is he gonna be someone we see as maybe starting the season playing 10-15 minutes?\n\nThomas Noie: Aidan: Carey Booth is as intriguing a prospect/player as anyone on the roster. He's like a young deer, kind of wobbly legged trying to walk/run/play all at the same time. He needs reps. He needs weight. He needs experience, but has so much potential. He could be a guy who maybe doesn't start at the start and then by January, you're like, whoa, he's ready for a bigger role. He's just so young. Give him time. He'll make the most of it.\n\nIllinois Fool: What are the chances of Shrew adding another player this summer? If I remember correctly he said that as long as a player was on campus by the fall things could work out.Thomas Noie: IF: I'd say the prospect of that happening is rather slim. Never say never in college basketball when a prospect might just appear one day and everything fits and he's on campus for the start of the fall semester. Listening to Shrewsberry the other day, you get the feeling that he's OK moving forward with this current roster. He's said that he won't make a stop-gap/quick decision on a prospect just to plug a hole. Everything about a possible player has to fit - short-term and long-term. That's a tough ask/find as August nears.\n\nTodd from NC: Based on what you may be hearing, where do we stand in the Jackson McAndrews chase? (We have at least a 25 percent chance at landing him!!!)Thomas Noie: Todd: He's one of the main targets for Notre Dame in the 2024, so there's that. And that he has Notre Dame in his top four means there's mutual interest. But it's recruiting, so even when you think you know, you don't...😄\n\nIllinois Fool: Will the scheduling philosophy change much under the new regime?Thomas Noie: IF: Too early to tell. When I sat with Micah Shrewsberry in early May, he had too many other areas that required his attention that he admitted he hadn't thought much (really, at all) about future scheduling, philosophy, etc. He did open the door to the idea of doing some cool/different/unique scheduling stuff similar to what the Notre Dame women's program is doing in playing South Carolina in Paris. Notre Dame will replace Marquette with Georgetown next season, so he does kind of get keeping some sort of connection with its Big East/private school past. A future home-and-home with Butler and Purdue are possibilities given Shrewsberry's connections to both schools. Notre Dame also will get an annual game with an SEC school, as part of the SEC/ACC Challenge. No more annual Big Ten commitment, and a recruiting emphasis on the Midwest, will open the chance to possibly add a Big Ten school here and there.\n\nTom, Atlanta - I wish I could be more optimistic, Tom, but this could be ND’s worst season since Digger’s first year. Patience will be required.Thomas Noie: For those too young to remember, that would be 6-20 in 1971-72 under a young Digger Phelps. Patience is an absolute must. Plenty of it. This is going to be a long year in many ways. That's what happens when you return only three players and have to build it back in the manner that Notre Dame requires. Micah Shrewsberry couldn't just mine the transfer portal for a quick fix. That's not this school. Or program. This is going to take time. Give him it.\n\nMike C: Hey Tom, can you confirm the new S&C guy is strictly for Men's Hoops and he won't be splitting time like Rolinski did?Thomas Noie: Mike: Greg Miskinis is indeed men's basketball only in terms of strength and conditioning. No dual roles. It's all hoops. He was with Micah Shrewsberry last season at Penn State, so he'll know exactly what the head coach wants/needs/expects.\n\nBobby Singer: Tom let’s say we can and only take 2 more on the 24 class who are the most likely 2 and who are the 2 you would want the most realistically?Thomas Noie: Bobby: I respect the question, but don't know enough about any of the guys to say for sure they're next in line. Who are they as people? As players? What does this team lack? Doesn't lack? Too many unknowns right now, so throwing a dart at the board, let's go with Jackson McAndrew for size and Sir Mohammed for versatility. Might also be good to get a point guard, either in the Class of 2024 or out of the portal.\n\nJ.J. Post: It feels like minutes for J.R. Koniecnzy has been the white whale of Notre Dame MBB for the last two seasons. It was impossible to watch his dunks in pregame warmups and not wonder how he couldn't seem to find serious minutes on an Irish team that wasn't exactly firing on all cylinders last year. Is it known what the reason was for him being unable to get on the floor last year - redshirt protection? And is there a sense that on a young, full-rebuild team he could finally step into a sizable role?Thomas Noie: Uhhh.....white whale? In what ways? It didn't matter if he was ready or somewhat ready or nowhere close to being ready (this), there was zero chance that Koniecnzy was going to play as a true freshman with a perimeter that featured Prentiss Hubb, Dane Goodwin, Cormac Ryan and a guy by the name of Blake Wesley. No chance for J.R. It was only slightly better last season, but too few minutes for him to matter, which is why he sat out. Once you decide to sit to redshirt, you have to stay seated to redshirt. No reason to burn an entire year for what, a week or two of meaningful minutes. It was understood on the front end of Koniecnzy's recruitment that this would be a long-term process. Now it's time for him to show it on the back end. There's opportunity. There's a role for him. There's maybe a starting role for him. He has to show that those first two years were spent smartly, that he learned the game, that he got stronger and got better. It's up to him now to deliver. It's there for him.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Based on the tea leaves........Trent Perry-No Chance. Los Angeles kid destined for the PAC 12/Big 10 (since SoCal is recruiting him). Only Rex P. and Richie Branning (throwback reference of the day) would make that move. Travis Perry-I had to look him up since I don't believe ND has even offered him. Maybe a backup PG if the other PG falls thru. Jackson McAndrew-ND has a puncher's chance. Let's add Garrett Sundra here too, since they play the same position. Sundra looks to be Plan B. He's the kid Brey would get when the real recruit he wanted went elsewhere. For Shrew, that would be Kon Knueppel-Cole Certa. Lastly, Sir Mohammed. Close to 0%. He backed away from ND once before. If you said NO once, you can easily say it twice. With 10 current and probably not too much turnover (we will see), Shrew is likely looking at 2 or 3 guys. Certa, McAndrew/Sundra and MAYBE MAYBE one wild card who surfaces later.Thomas Noie: My tea leaves (coming from people who know way more than me) are a bit different, particularly when it comes to Mohammed. Get him and Certa and Sundra and McAndrew and call it a class. Let's go.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Can you provide insight on how the coaching and support staff has evolved under Shrew? How many now vs. Brey? Is the overall budget for staff significantly better? Is this indicative of Brey being asleep at the switch and Shrew is more plugged in? Has the ND admin. finally realized that to compete in today's free spending, free agent world of college sports, you better pony up or bow out? Your thoughts?Thomas Noie: When it came to his staff/support structure, Mike Brey often liked to tell the story of the night Notre Dame played Ohio State at Purcell Pavilion in December 2020. Brey walked out of the locker room just before tip, looked over at the Buckeye bench and saw that they had something like 15 staff members all in golf shirts. He remembers thinking, now THAT'S a basketball program, where you have enough emphasis/university support to throw enough money at however many assistants you need. In 2022 when Notre Dame played Texas Tech in the NCAA tournament, the Red Raider team picture on its web site featured 47 individuals - coaches, players, support staff, etc. Notre Dame will never be THAT serious about hoops, but the message was clear - it had to do better than three assistant coaches, an ops guy and a video guy. Brey pushed - begged?? - for years to extend the staff to help get his players more help. Notre Dame never budged.\n\nLast year, the Irish men's basketball program had a head coach, an associate head coach, two assistant coaches, a video coordinator and an ops/recruiting coordinator. Six people. This year's men's basketball program has a head coach, an associate head coach, two assistant coaches, an assistant to the head coach, two recruiting staffers and an ops guy. Eight total. Notre Dame finally got serious about its support staff. Kind of a right time, right guy thing for Shrewsberry,\n\nJohn: Is Knueppel a moon shot? Know there was mention of him visiting in August.Thomas Noie: That would mean Kon Knueppel would have to be the Brad Stevens or Jay Wright of the 2024 recruiting class to make him a moon shot, right? Wouldn't go down that road.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I hope you are right and I am wrong. Same thing I tell the missus. 😃Thomas Noie: Can anyone really be right in recruiting?😃\n\nGuest: Who are the next 3 Irish legends to go in the rafters? Chris Thomas, Matt Carroll, Connaughton/Grant combo spot ?Thomas Noie: It will be interesting to see how the Ring of Honor carries on as we move forward. It was totally a Mike Brey thing. He had the final say on what guy went up next and when. Next up? Think John Paxson, Pat Garrity and Chris Thomas. the Pat Connaughton/Jerian Grant (which should've already happened) might not occur until both are done playing.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Not now with free agency. The schools basically had total control over the athletes. Not any more. That's part one of the problem for ND. Part 2 is the academic standards. And Part 3 is the one that burns me the most. ND, or Stanford or Vandy finds a kid early. The kid explodes and here comes Duke, Kentucky.......Can't say as I blame the kid but it has to be frustrating as hell for schools to invest so much into a kid and then have the kid do a 180.Thomas Noie: Preach. All true, and all goes back to what one ND hoops hack wrote in NDI back in January about why this will be a really hard job for the new guy moving forward. We've already seen it - there's no quick portal fix and filling out the roster is a tedious process where fit is critical. There are roadblocks and landmines everywhere for this Notre Dame program, and we haven't even touched NIL. That's why when people shout from the shadows about what the previous head coach couldn't do, you give them the side eye and wonder, what color is the sky in your world? Mike Brey could've done better, but he also could've and maybe should've done a whole lot worse. You can bet there already have been a few times when Micah Shrewsberry and his staff have learned how Notre Dame works and what you can and can't do and have thought, man, this is going to be reallllly difficult. Welcome to Notre Dame.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I would never say \"ND Hoops hack\". I would say \"The definitive source for all things ND Men's BBL.\" That said, as plugged in as Shrew is/was to D1 BBL, to the NBA, and to Indiana state BBL, he knew what he was getting into. Which tells me that deep down, he thinks he is the right man for the job. Sounds good to me.Thomas Noie: That said about Micah, I'm sure there still have been a few \"Oh, OK...\" moments. Especially with the beat guy he's got to deal with every day for six months come October...😄\n\nJoe, Cape May: From your job perspective, how do you go about gaining rapport with an entirely new staff after working with Brey for so many years and most of his assistants being familiar faces?Thomas Noie: Joe: Just put in the work. I've sat with Micah Shrewsberry and each of his three assistants so far this summer. Get to know them a little. Don't make it all question and answer stuff. Turn off the recorder and just talk with them as people. Let them know who I am, what my job is and no matter what happens - good or bad - I'll be there. Even after a tough game or tough analysis, I'll always be there the next day. Accountability matters. Next up, I'd like to know the strength coach and those behind the scenes a little better. Media and those we cover aren't on the same team in any way shape or form, but we're all kind of on this crazy roller-coaster ride of college basketball together. Brey got that, maybe better than anyone. Shrewsberry's very similar.\n\nPatrick, NYC: Hi Tom! So grateful for this summer chat and the season can't come soon enough. Sounds like a lot of unknowns. To that end, for pure fun speculation, what would be your top 3 pleasant potential surprises for this team next year? (Maybe seeing Zona being a force would be one, I was surprised to see you having him start with Booth on the bench)Thomas Noie: Patrick: In no particular order (OK, some order): Markus Burton hits the ground running and is a problem for other teams to deal with as the starting point guard; this team is a team with no real standout guy but a bunch of guys who are going to get after it and play with a determination that we didn't really see last season to the point where we can see where all of this eventually can go; Matt Zona and Kebba Njie can hold their own against some of the frontline talent they're going to see this season in the ACC. A fourth would be seeing a young/inexperienced guy suddenly blossom/blow up (looking at you Carey Booth and/or J.R. Konieczny. 😄\n\nGuest: Are Anthony Solomon and Antoni Wyche actively looking for coaching gigs?Thomas Noie: No. There's no immediate need for either to work this season.😃\n\nJim Tal, Valley Center CA.: Given the sorry state of the program that he inherited, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job of filling up the roster, reenergizing recruiting and generally stabilizing things than what Micah S. has done. Frankly, I think he's exceeded all possible expectations up to this point. Would you agree, Tom?Thomas Noie: Jim: Absolutely. This was a near-impossible situation - a depleted roster, no returning veterans, no direction, no leadership. The past four months probably have felt more like four years for Shrewsberry, who's been going 100 since he was hired. It's been a long road with a longer one to go. At least there's some stability. Some direction. Some life. This season won't show it through wins, but the payoff will come. Some day.\n\nJustin, Ft. Wayne: I know you had a chance to see the players this week. With the new s&c coach and the videos i’ve seen them post, it looks like the players are looking like actual touch physical basketball players. Any takeaways you had from their physical appearance while watching them?Thomas Noie: Justin: Honestly, no because our viewing window was so small that there wasn't enough time to really look at a guy and think about how his body has changed. There was too much to see, particularly with how Micah Shrewsberry runs a workout. It's easy to say everything's going to be different with a new strength and conditioning coach and guys are going to be bigger, but that doesn't mean better. The physicality aspect, like with everything else Notre Dame men's basketball, is going to be a process. It's going to take time. This team will still have strength/size issues moving forward. It just will.\n\nIllinois Fool: What kind of player should we expect the Shrewsbury kid to be?Thomas Noie: IF: Hate to send you to the principal's office, IF, but, man, let's at least get the last name right. SHREWSBERRY....Give him time to develop. He's been around too much basketball and too high a level to not have at least some of it rub off on him. Hate to keep circling back to the small window we had the other day, but it's hard to really say what he and Logan Imes can be. Need to see a larger sample size. Like five-on-five.\n\nBill: Thanks Tom for the extensive updates— I’m surprised Shrews is so focused on mid west especially with so mush competition from the big ten — why not look more recruiting at north east - New York- Jersey - Washington — lots of talent capable of meeting ND academics - thanksThomas Noie: Bill: The Midwest will be INCLUDED in the recruiting footprint, something that wasn't always the case in seasons past. Ryan Owens' background in AAU is in the Midwest. The guy knows everybody, so it would be foolish to dismiss kids in Illinois and Ohio and Michigan and deeper into Indiana because it's Big Ten country. Given that it takes a special kind of kid to go to Notre Dame, they'll look anywhere. By no means are they going to limit themselves to this or that region.\n\nJDub, Ft. Wayne: Does the fact that Micah worked under Brad Stevens and Matt Painter for so long, and achieved a lot of success with them, does that impress you at all and give you a better feeling that he will succeed as a head coach, or is it really more the person that succeeds and not who they really learned from in this case?Thomas Noie: JuDub: Great that he worked for Painter and Stevens, but what does he know? How does he coach? How does he run a program? How does he handle success? Adversity? It's not like Painter or Stevens are these elite of elite coaches/basketball savants who've enjoyed endless success. They're good. Shrewsberry can draw on those experiences and add a wrinkle or two of his own. Matt Doherty played for Dean Smith and worked for Roy Williams, but he struggled as a head coach at the elite level. It doesn't automatically happen.\n\nChris. Fairfax, Va: Tom, Do you think more fans will attend games this year ? So frustrating to see the empty seats. Thanks. Chris.Thomas Noie: Chris: You're going to get me in trouble with the fan base now, aren't you? Good. Let's go. Time for the fan base (and you too student body) to put up or shut up. Heard for years about how they didn't like this and they didn't like that and if only this or that was different would they be more interested in the program. Well, guess what, EVERYTHING about the program is new and different. Time for them to get excited and get behind basketball. No more excuses now, right? Yep, that's the grumpy old beat writer being the grumpy, old beat writer. But we heard for years how they tired of the old regime and if only they were gone would everything change. They're gone. Will they change? We'll see.\n\nTodd Leahy, Charlotte: Hopefully you know where Charlotte is and I don't need to type NC. Is it too early to tell what the relationship will be like between Shrewsberry and Pete Bevacqua? Is the new AD going to be too focused on renewing the NBC deal?Thomas Noie: Todd: Charlotte, Arizona??? LOL. Yeah, way too early. Pete Bevacqua was at the Notre Dame hoops workout earlier this week, but probably wasn't about to digest it too deep with everything else on his plate. That he's an ND guy has to work in the program's favor. Shrewsberry gets it. Bevacqua does as well. Still, it's weird that the guy who hired you is out the door less than a year later, which shouldn't be all that much of a surprise. Swarbrick wasn't expected to still be in the job by 2025.\n\nChris. Fairfax, Va: I wonder if JR is still the best dunker? They have some athleticism on the team.Thomas Noie: Think he'd trade that title for best player.

As a kid who grew up near the legendary backside, no amount of rain was going to keep him from watching the race from the rail far from the frontside.\n\nSloan and his family, who were invited to this year's race by a family friend, were going in and out of watching from their car, which was parked on the backside. Sloan said while he liked Sandman, Coal Battle seemed to like the slop.“But I think this jacket is cursed and brings the rain,” he said.Not far from the rail, tucked inside the office of a barn, David and Erin Kuntzweiler sat watching the races on TV with the heater on, drying out from the rain.\n\nThe Kuntzweilers had walked on the track with their daughter, trainer Greta Kuntzweiler, after she walked a horse to the paddock for the fourth race, but the muddy track made it difficult.\n\n“I almost lost my shoe,” David said with a laugh, his Brooks sneakers caked with dirt.\n\n—Stephanie Kuzydym\n\nI-264 reopened after semi crash, but Derby traffic still heavy\n\nWestbound lanes on Interstate 264 near Poplar Level Road are reopened after a semitruck accident caused an extended closure, Louisville Metro Police officials said on social media.\n\nA jackknifed semi forced officials to close multiple lanes and backed up traffic in the area, which is just a few exits east of Churchill Downs.\n\nLMPD officials said traffic is still heavy in the area.\n\n— Killian Baarlaer\n\n'Anything can happen in the Derby'\n\nKelly Will and Sarah Ahmad have been coming the Kentucky Derby for years.\n\nWhile they love the fun fashion, with Will sporting a rose inspired top hat she won at the Hats for Hope Auction and a red cape and Ahmad wearing a custom made purple hat, the duo are most excited to support their friend who has a horse in the Derby race.\n\nDiana Robbins is a part owner of the Bob Baffert trained Citizen Bull this year. And Robbins is no newbie to the sport, she also had an ownership stake in former Derby winners Justify and Authentic.\n\nRobbins said Citizen Bull has a bit of a tough race ahead coming out of the number one post, but “anything can happen in the Derby.”\n\n— Olivia Evans\n\nWhich Derby horse is Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg betting on?\n\nAs the Kentucky Derby crept closer this year, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg still did not have a Derby pick — or know who the frontrunner was — with the race less than two weeks out.\n\nAsked at a press conference on April 22 which Derby horse he was betting on, Greenberg said: “I haven’t started paying attention to this year’s field — I’ve been focused on floods, getting ready for my budget address on Thursday, so I’ve got to admit, I’ve not yet paid too close of attention to the Derby field. I will be ready by next week.”\n\nFollowing that, a Courier Journal reporter told Greenberg there was a horse named Journalism in the race.\n\n“Is there? Is that a Derby horse? That sounds good, I’ll put two bucks on it for you,” he said.\n\nBy Derby week, it was clear the mayor had done his homework.\n\nEnter a horse named Sandman.\n\n“I loved watching the opening Derby draw. I know he didn’t get the greatest post position, but I’m still going with Sandman,” Greenberg said in a video from Derby’s opening night on April 26 that was later shared on Instagram.\n\nHowever, speaking to The Courier Journal the same day, Greenberg also said: \"I'm still doing a little bit of handicapping. Right now, I'm looking heavily at American Promise.\"\n\nAs Derby week progressed, any waffling that may have existed appeared to end with the mayor doubling down his support for the gray colt Sandman.\n\n“I’m going with Sandman this year,” he said on WHAS-TV on Thursday.\n\nAnd on the night of Oaks, Greenberg posted a photo on social media alongside TikTok star and Sandman minority owner Griffin Johnson with the caption: “We’ll be rooting for you tomorrow, Sandman!!”\n\n—Josh Wood\n\nA Derby birthday bash at Churchill Downs\n\nKaitlen Zeidler, who celebrated her 29th birthday on Thursday, traveled from the Illinois side of St. Louis to attend her first ever Kentucky Derby.\n\nShe put in a ton of research refining her look and checking out resale pieces, before settling on a striking pink and orange flower hat that could not have matched the pink and orange flowers on her dress more perfectly.\n\n“I love this,” she said, of Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby experience. “It’s beautiful and it’s the best place to go to people watch. I have the passion for the bourbon and [my partner] has the passion for the bourbon. This is the perfect place for us.”\n\nShe was looking forward to two things. The first was seeing Derby favorite Sandman race, and the second was coming back to Churchill Downs with their daughters, who are 10, 9 and 2, once they turn 21.\n\n—Maggie Menderski\n\nSimone Biles walks the red carpet, speaks about giving the famed 'riders up' command\n\nOlympic gymnast Simone Biles walked the red carpet with her husband, NFL player Jonathan Owens, both in head-to-toe purple outfits and hats.\n\n“We love being able to do events together because it’s not super common when we’re in the same room at the same time celebrating something so special,” Biles said.\n\nBiles will be giving the \"riders up\" call ahead of the Derby race, but the seven-time gold medalist said she doesn’t need to practice the announcement.

Joel Casse is the son of trainer Mark Casse who is the trainer of Sandman, so that’s going to be the police pick for the week,” he said.\n\nHumphrey said he’s enjoying the experience, even with the scattered rainfall, and said weather is keeping the crowds pretty mellow.\n\n“It’s been a good day even though it’s been raining,” he said. “I’d rather it be sunshine and everybody looking great in their Derby outfits, but I think the rain is keeping the crowd down, keeping it calm.”\n\nHe also said safety efforts have run efficiently throughout the week outside of situations considered pretty standard to law enforcement around Derby.\n\n“With the exception of the usual stuff — people getting lost and forgetting where they parked their cars — things have been running really smoothly,” he said. “Crowds have been cooperative, so if everybody just remembers to be patient, we’ll get where we need to go. Understand its going to take a little bit of time to get where you need to go, but we’ll get you there safely.”\n\nHumphrey said he’s looking forward to experiencing Kentucky Derby as the chief, with no assignment to a specific post and the ability to chat with the crowds and check-in on his officers. He said he first started working at Derby years ago directing traffic before spending much of his time on the SWAT team.\n\nFrom in-flight meet-cutes to the Derby in a matter of weeks\n\nFormer NFL defensive end Chase Winovich showed up on Churchill Downs' red carpet in a custom light blue striped suit with button detailing from Javelin in Williamsburg, New York City.\n\n“We were going back and forth over some of the designs, and I said it’s the end of the game, we’ve got the Derby on the line,\" he said. \"If you take the shot, you can’t miss.”\n\nWinovich said coordinating his outfit with his date’s dress was a little last-minute, and for good reason. They only met a month ago, when she was his flight attendant.\n\n“I love Delta, big fan,” Winovech said, looking over at his date. “I think it’s the best airline, they have the best flight attendants.”\n\n— Kirby Adams & Keely Doll\n\n'From the hats to the history,' Guy Fieri on the magic of Derby\n\nAmerican restaurateur and author Guy Fieri stopped on the red carpet to talk about his experience in the Winner's Circle when Animal Kingdom won the 2011 Kentucky Derby.\n\n\"It was one of the craziest things I've seen. One, we lost our minds ... we all take off and we run down and they're just getting ready to close to gate and we do not have the right credentials to be down there. But as we get to the gate, they're like 'chef' and I'm like 'yeah that's my buddy's horse,' and they're like, 'ok, go!'\"\n\nFieri said that's the magic of the Derby.\n\n\"I'm telling you, any chance you can get to come to the Derby and experience this, everything from the hats to the history, you've got to do it.\"\n\n—Kirby Adams\n\nKentucky Derby a 'once in a lifetime' spectacle\n\nTim Cooper stood smoking a cigar and enjoying a mixed drink the afternoon of the 151st Kentucky Derby. He said that while he’s not a whiskey and bourbon drinker, he’s opting for a mint julep for his next drink.\n\n“I don’t like whiskey myself, but I’m probably going to have a mint julep after this,” he said. “You got to have one.”\n\nThe Minnesota resident, originally from Chicago, said he and his colleague, also a close friend, decided after a night of drinks to attend the Run for the Roses for the first time.\n\n“We do crazy stuff all the time. We bet on random stuff so we were like ‘We should go to the Kentucky Derby,’” he said. “We got drunker that night and just bought tickets.”\n\nCooper said that although they’d just recently arrived, he was enjoying the atmosphere and crowds.\n\n“It’s once in a lifetime,” he said. “The whole spectacle of the thing is great.”\n\nChris Tucker, Guy Fieri and more spotted on Kentucky Derby red carpet\n\nThe red carpet at Churchill Downs was heating up Saturday ahead of the 2025 Kentucky Derby, including celebrities such as Chris Tucker, Guy Fieri, Billy Gilman, Brantley Gilbert, Ciara O' Doherty, Dylan Dreyer and Miss America Abbie Stockard.\n\nAlso spotted were Lee Brice, Steve Wilson, Gail Simmons and Wilmer Valderrama, as well as special appearances from the Kentucky Derby Winner's Gold Cup and the NBA Finals Trophy.\n\nFashion emergency! Churchill Downs staff member rescues Derby dress\n\nApril Koenig, of Cincinnati, had a fashion emergency Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe hem of her dress came undone right as she arrived at the race track.\n\nGail OBannon with Churchill Downs guest services stepped in with a fresh roll of silver duct tape, and 15 minutes later, Koenig’s hem was back in place. OBannon also came through with a clear garbage bag to shield Koenig’s hat from the rain.“Our job is to make sure our guests have a comfortable experience, a good experience, no matter what the issue is, we're supposed to be prepared,” OBannon said.\n\nKoenig and her husband, Stuart, attended the Kentucky Oaks on Friday, as well as the Unbridled Eve Derby Gala. “It's kind of like when you're in high school and you get ready for the prom,” April Koenig said. “It's almost like the getting ready and the anticipation … It's just like all the things that lead up to the Derby.”It had been a number of years since their first Derby, but they were glad to be back and see everyone’s fashions.“The Derby, we always joke about it: There's so many clothes, so much work, and by the time you're done, it's like the most expensive weekend on planet Earth,” Stuart said.\n\n—Matt Glowicki\n\nLive cheese carving provides 'edible entertainment' at track\n\nOf an array of dishes available inside Club SI, a luxury dining area at Churchill Downs, such as hand-sliced prime rib roast, patrons gravitated to witness Sarah Kaufmann’s cheese carving in action. Also known as the “Cheese Lady,” the San Diego-based cheese artist returned for her third Kentucky Derby on Saturday to share her “edible entertainment” in the form of mild Wisconsin cheddar.\n\n“I'm really proud to be here as one of the entertainment pieces for the Derby guests,” she told the Courier Journal. “It’s the most prestigious thing in the world.”\n\nAfter sculpting a scene of woman wearing a hat adorned with lilies on Friday for the Kentucky Oaks, Kaufmann planned to spend several hours finalizing a Derby-themed cheese creation, including a horse and jockey.\n\n“People will come back multiple times to watch my progress and talk to me and taste the cheese,” she said. “They come back and visit and get a picture. It’s wonderful.\"\n\n— Amanda Hancock\n\n'Looking forward to the food.'

He brought along his mom, dad, and wife for the trip to Louisville.\n\n“Just the historic level of the Derby, it already feels like such an honor,” he told the Courier Journal. “I think that there's a whole culture here that I'm just excited to be involved with.”\n\nThe content creator with 7 million followers on TikTok and 10 million subscribers on YouTube, teamed up with Churchill Downs to create the 2025 \"Kentucky Derby At-Home\" menu and two specialty items served up on Saturday, including Kentucky Bourbon Hot Honey Pork Belly and a Kentucky twist on Challah French Toast.\n\n“The number one thing I’m looking forward to is the food for today,” Weissman said, balancing a plate full of potatoes, rib roast and bourbon French toast. “That being said, of course, the race, but honestly, the most fun part is being around a bunch of people having a great time.”\n\nWhen cooking up menu ideas, Weissman joked his main inspiration was “bourbon.”\n\n“Sometimes it's hard to explain a feeling in food, but I do think there's a certain energy in the type of food that should be served at the Derby,” he said. “I just tried my best to bring that same energy while also bringing my style.”\n\nWeissman, who also traveled with a videographer, said he’s excited to share some of his experience at Churchill Downs with his online followers.\n\n“This is one of those events where it's like, if you don't know what it is and you haven't seen it, you need to,” he said. “I think it will be kind of a pivotal moment for them when they see it.”\n\nIt was shaping up to be a big moment for him, too.\n\n“I didn't realize how massive this is,” he said. “I'm having a good time.

This year, Oliva spent a handful of days hand-sewing his own blanket of roses to wear along with pants that mimicked grass.\n\n“I do a different outfit every year,” Oliva said. “So this is what I came up with this year, and I’m pretty proud of it.”\n\n— Olivia Evans\n\n'We're not going to let the rain keep us down.' Beshear arrives on red carpet\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, his wife Britainy and their two children walked the red carpet on Saturday at the 2025 Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.\n\n\"It's so exciting to be able to do this as a full family. This is now our third year we've gotten to come here all together. They were a lot shorter when we started,\" he said of his children, Lila and Will.\n\n\"This is what the Derby is about. It's about creating amazing memories as a family and with friends, so excited to be here. We're not going to let the rain keep us down. We're going to have a great Derby welcoming millions upon millions of people from around the world watching and a couple of hundred thousand of our closest friends right here with us today.\"\n\nBeshear also showed off his \"Kentucky surprise,\" where the lining of his custom Derby jacket included little blue images of the state of Kentucky.\n\n\"I've got a tailor named Tyler Brown, who is actually an officer in the National Guard who put this together.

He has, after all, rode in more than 7,000 dirt races.\n\nBut he's developed a secret across all those mounts, besides wearing multiple pairs of goggles.\n\nDuring his first ride of Derby Day, in the second race aboard Dallas Stewart-trained Tapit Quick, Hernandez wore four pairs to protect his eyes from the dirt.\n\n\"But we use this plastic,\" he said, pointing to his jockey cap and the goggles layered on top of each other..\n\nThe plastic was the kind of plastic wrap a host would use to cover a dish on a holiday.\n\n\"For some reason, the mud doesn't stick to the plastic,\" he said with a shrug. \"It just falls right off.\"\n\n— Stephanie Kuzydzym\n\nTrump hails Derby as 'elegant celebration of our culture' in statement\n\nIn a statement sent out by the White House on Saturday morning, President Donald Trump praised the Kentucky Derby as “an iconic American institution and an elegant celebration of our culture, customs, and unwavering competitive spirit.”\n\nThe president, who last attended the Derby in 2022, pointed to the distant past in his statement, saying “the promise of Manifest Destiny was beating in the hearts of the 10,000 spectators” gathered at Churchill Downs for the first Run for the Roses in 1875.\n\n“Now, as our Nation gathers for that same Derby 150 years later — and 1 year before we celebrate 250 years of independence — we recognize that we are in the early days of a new Golden Age,” he said.\n\nTrump’s statement gave no indication as to whether he would be attending this year’s race.\n\nTrump attended Derby 148 in 2022 as part of a fundraiser hosted by a Trump-aligned super PAC.\n\nIn February, Trump attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, but left at halftime.\n\nRead the full statement below.\n\n— Josh Wood\n\nGroup tells politician: 'Hands Off Medicaid!' during 2025 Kentucky Derby\n\nProtect Our Care has a message they want Republican U.S House Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie to hear on Derby Day: Don’t touch Medicaid.\n\nAccording to a press release, the organization is flying a plane between 2 to 6 p.m., with a banner reading: “Tell Brett Guthrie: Hands Off Medicaid!”\n\nThe banner is supposed to encourage Guthrie, who is chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, to reject potential cuts to the program.\n\nThe House Committee on Energy and Commerce will potentially hold its markup on a mega bill that could change the Medicaid program next week, including a proposal that could cap federal Medicaid payments to states.\n\nCan your favorite horse handle mud?\n\nHorse trainer Larry Demeritte waited for Grace on Grace following the second race of Derby Day, standing on the edge of the sloppy track following the heavy morning rain.\n\nDemeritte spent the morning, though, training his horses in the rain some avoided.\n\n\"Some trainers walk their horses on rainy days,\" he said. \"I don't. I'm old school.\"\n\nHis thinking is this: what if it's muddy come race time, like it will be throughout this first Saturday in May, with rain in the forecast all day.\n\n\"What do you do if you don't know if your horse can handle the mud?\" Demeritte said. \"That's why we train in it.\"\n\n— Stephanie Kuzydym\n\n'Queen for a Day' at Churchill Downs\n\nEven with the damp skies Melanie and James Dycus, of San Antonio, were excited for their first Kentucky Derby.\n\nComing to the Run for the Roses had always been a bucket list item for Melanie, who grew up around horses. They’d been fortunate to get tickets this year through a connection James had from his two decades of service in the U.S Army.\n\nAs they stood indoors, near the 300 section, just after the first race, they tried to recall the name of a horse James had his eye on for the Old Forester Turf Classic.\n\n“Was it Queen for a Day?” she asked genuinely.\n\n“No, that’s you baby,” he said wryly, before scrolling through his phone to find its name — Gold Phoenix.\n\n— Maggie Menderski\n\nFamilies enjoying Derby atmosphere despite rainy weather\n\nShoppers streamed out of pop-up shops with rain ponchos, long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts as temperatures dropped in Louisville following a heavy downpour just as the gates opened for Derby Day.\n\nOne Churchill Downs groundskeeper used a push broom to spread puddles of water.\n\nBut a whole lot of liquid sunshine was not about to dampen the spirits of one Connecticut family.\n\n\"This is a bucket list item for me,\" Francis Luperella, who retired a year ago from TV broadcast.\n\nThe family began planning the trip more than a year ago. They enjoyed Oaks yesterday from the First Turn Club.\n\n\"Rain or shine, we were going to come,\" Aubrey Sepko said.\n\nSepko and her husband John, sister Taylor Kintop and her husband Bryan Cardinelli as well as Luperella's wife Donna Kintop were all tucked into ponchos but full of smiles. They said they were enjoying their time in Louisville, calling the employees and the locals \"kind.\"\n\n\"It's exceeded our wildest dreams,\" Luperella said. \"And we haven't even seen the Derby run yet.\"\n\nThe entire family is already planning to be back next year.\n\n— Stephanie Kuzydym\n\nKroger delivers the Garland of Roses to Churchill Downs\n\nDozens gathered outside the main gates of Churchill Downs to watch the parade of roses be carried into the track as a steady drizzle fell. The Garland of Roses, which will be donned by the winner of the Kentucky Derby, was unloaded from a Kroger ice box truck and paraded through the Woodford Reserve Paddock Plaza. Race fans watched and cheered as members of the military carried the bright red roses into the track. Along with the garland, dozens of bouquets of Kroger roses were carried into the track, as well.\n\nWill it be a rainy Saturday in Louisville?\n\nYes. There'll be rain. Early arrivers are already sporting their ponchos. Churchill Downs doesn't allow umbrellas.\n\nBut the good news (so far, at least) is that meteorologists expect it to be early. As of Saturday morning, National Weather Service in Louisville predicts a 100% chance of precipitation Saturday for the Kentucky Derby, with showers most likely to be prevalent before 5 p.m.\n\nThere's still a chance of showers and a thunderstorm after 5 p.m. Expect conditions to remain mostly cloudy, with a high near 63 and a North wind 3 to 6 mph.\n\n— Chris Sims\n\nCelebrities walk the red carpet at Kentucky Derby eve galas\n\nOn Friday night, celebrities gathered for the Unbridled Eve Gala, which benefits 15 charities.

I am deeply committed to giving back to the community that gave so much to me, especially the public schools and teachers who inspired my desire to major in biology.\n\n\"This year, my Advisory Board and I have selected Chatham County Public Schools as our beneficiaries. We will be selecting teachers and students to receive cash prizes and awards for their outstanding contributions to the community. For this reason, I am overly excited to host my 2nd annual Courageous Creations fashion show, featuring my clothing line, in my hometown of Savannah this year.\"\n\nDo: Did you study design or are you self-taught?\n\nZanders: \"No formal sewing training (self-taught...I call it God-taught). I attended Fort Valley State University for my Bachelor of Science in Biology (2002-2006). I also attended Alabama A&M University for my Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (2008-2010). But in the fashion realm, I started making a Pinterest board of elements of fashion that I loved and began to design my style by trial and error. I did not previously know how to use a commercial pattern (a hurdle) but this has taught me how to use unconventional ways to sew.\n\n\"Also, YouTube has been a wealth of knowledge and I also enrolled in an online course (Sew It Academy) to help with complicated techniques and to further my craft. I was encouraged to start designing after having my son. I felt that my new body type was not flattering as once before and I wanted a way to still feel and look confident.\n\n\"However, I couldn’t bear the disappointment of going shopping in the marketplace going a size up before being able to fit into my pre-pregnancy clothing. Therefore, I purchased some practice fabric and started experimenting based on what would flatter my body type. This resonated with many women who had similar stories or who had a difficult time finding clothing that would work for their body type.\"\n\nDo: What inspires you and what is the driving force and inspiration for the show?\n\nZanders: \"I draw inspiration from the women I design for since I am a ready to wear designer. I try to envision the best silhouette for my clients and base my designs off what would make them feel their best.\n\n\"Melanated Masterpieces is a celebratory collection geared towards women of color to display all the beautiful rich tones inside and outside of our nude color spectrum. In addition, it will showcase women of all shapes and sizes displaying a color story which pays homage to our undertones and the deep colors that celebrate our shades.\"\n\nDo: What’s a day like in the day of a designer?\n\nZanders: \"I am not a full-time designer (yet). I am a wife, a mom and a full-time microbiologist. I sew in the early mornings before getting my 4-year-old son off to school, work a regular day shift and sew in the evenings before bed.\"\n\nNeed a new look?: Check out these five Savannah thrift stores for trendy clothes and jewelry\n\nDo: What are your favorite materials to work with?\n\nZanders: \"Funny thing is I use to be afraid of stretch knits, but they are my favorite fabrics to work with, they flatter any body types.\"\n\nDo: Who’s the women you design for and what sets you apart?\n\nZanders: \"I design for women of all shapes, curves and sizes. What has set Courageous Creations apart from the masses is that the majority of what we make is exclusive. Because each piece is custom made and the materials are not produced in bulk.\n\n\"Therefore, we only make a few orders from a single batch of fabric. This helps us keep the cost down and provide the client with a unique piece all within a reasonable price range for the client. Each new piece generates novel ideas that can be integrated into future pieces to make new creations. It is my heart’s desire to spread the joy of the Lord through my creativity and fashion designs.\"\n\nDo: What has been the biggest challenge as a designer?\n\nZanders: \"Since I did not attend school with the aspirations of becoming a business owner nor am I a trained seamstress, I find these two hurdles are hardest to overcome.\n\n\"Although I can visualize beautiful designs, making them come to life is another story. Some of my most successful designs happen by accident. For example, I wanted to create a pair of high-waisted wide-leg pants, turns out I didn’t have enough fabric to accommodate the length of the pants. I took the available length and made wide-leg capris that became exceedingly popular with my clients. It takes practice, motivation and drive to deliver a stellar product and I am committed to doing just that!\"\n\nDo: And on the other hand, what has been your biggest accomplishment or person you’ve designed or styled for thus far? Maybe favorite piece you’ve designed?\n\nZanders: \"I feel accomplished when I see the confidence, I can visibly see in the pictures my clients post on social media or send me to post on our platforms.

Sibling rivalry, especially when it comes to kids of the same sex, is common – and even more so when they are less than two years apart, according to Nationwide Children’s Hospital.\n\nKnowing that I’m one of countless parents going through this issue brings me solace, but I need to do something to change the dynamic.

This challenge led me to seek out two parenting experts to change our parenting tactics.

They’re going to have a playmate.’ ”\n\n\n\nWhen that doesn’t happen, Kennedy, better known as “Dr. Becky,” said it can be a letdown. “You say to yourself, ‘I didn’t expect this to happen for our kids to be fighting all the time.’ But fighting in some degree is a normal part of sibling relationships.”\n\nI thought that having two boys meant that they would be the best of friends building block castles and giggling, not having MMA-style fights before the sun has risen.\n\nKennedy suggested that I look at it from my 4-year old’s perspective.\n\n“A first kid has a whole family system, and then a second kid comes along, and everything that the first kid knew about how to feel safe in the world, how to get love and attention from their parents, is totally thrown in the air and mixed around,” she said.\n\n“The person who we want our kid to see as a playmate feels like a competitor,” she added. “Not a competitor for the green truck that they are fighting over but really a competitor for feeling valuable and worthy, getting one-on-one time and being seen.”\n\nA 4-year-old doesn’t know how to express those feelings, she said, so he gets attention by “walking up to (his) brother and smacking them.”\n\nReplace the word ‘stop’ with ‘I won’t let you’\n\nOn a typical Saturday morning, I take my boys to our playroom and watch them play. For the first few minutes, all will appear calm, so I’ll go upstairs and heat up my stale coffee.\n\nWhether I’m with them or not, it’s guaranteed that one will want the toy the other one has. Then a wrestling match ensues, which turns into screaming and crying with me breaking it up like a bouncer at a nightclub.\n\nI almost always tell the older one to share with his little brother, and I always find myself yelling some version of “Stop fighting!”\n\nKennedy said I’ve got it all wrong.\n\n“We cannot say to kids, ‘Give the toys back.’ And we cannot say, ‘Stop doing that,’ ” she said. “You’re saying to a kid, ‘I see you’re out of control, but I’m not willing to step into my role as an authority as a parent. … Can you stop doing the thing that you clearly can’t stop doing?’ ”\n\nShe’s right. I ask my 4-year-old to share because I know my younger child has a more difficult time doing so.\n\n“That’s actually very terrifying for a kid because your kid is thinking, ‘Wow, my parent isn’t able to help me here and they’re asking me to do an adult job.’ We can always replace ‘we don’t and stop’ with ‘I won’t let you.’ ”\n\nMelas says she and her husband feel like referees when their two boys start fighting. Katherine Jennings/CNN\n\nKennedy also said no to time-outs, which I resort to if my older son repeatedly does something I’ve asked him not to do, such as jumping on the couch. “All that happens when you send a kid to time-out and especially if you spank them is, ‘I don’t want to be around you. You’re a bad kid.’ “\n\nShe doesn’t like threats either. “You can’t learn to manage a feeling by punishing a behavior. … We can tell our kids what we will do, not what they can’t do. Saying, ‘If you don’t stop jumping on the couch, you won’t get your iPad.’ That requires my kid to do something. That’s why threats and consequences don’t actually work.”\n\nKennedy plays out various scenarios for parents and caregivers in videos on her Instagram page, and she did it for me.\n\nThe next time I see my children are fighting, she suggested I say: ” ‘I won’t let you take his toy.’ Because really what you’re saying is, ‘You’re a great kid, but you’re doing something that is not a great decision and because I love you, I’m going to stop you.’\n\n“Your kids aren’t making good decisions because they don’t have the skills,” she said. “You and your husband have to teach them the skills.”\n\nWhen they are doing something they shouldn’t be doing, she suggests another option. I should say, ‘I won’t let you jump on the couch, but you can jump on the floor.’ Or ‘I won’t let you say those potty words here, but you can go say them in the bathroom.’ ”\n\nEmily Edlynn, a child clinical psychologist and author of the upcoming book “Parenting for Autonomy: Stop Doing Their Laundry and Other Radical, Science-Backed Practices to Raise Self-Sufficient Kids,” agreed my husband and I can teach them the skills they need to learn.\n\n“Especially at 2 and 4,” Edlynn said, “they don’t have the self-regulation when their brother is antagonizing them. I always think of we (parents) are their brains. That’s why letting them fight to the death doesn’t really work. Teaching some skills helps them as their brains develop and will help them later in life.”\n\nIt’s important to narrate the issue at hand, she said: “You take the toy and say, ‘Hey, we have a problem,’ and the 4-year-old will probably tell you the little brother took the toy.\n\n“You will need to narrate and identify the problem calmly, and then hopefully their emotions are turning down. Then working with them to solve the problem, you could say, ‘What do you think it’s like for your little brother to not have the toy he wants? I think he feels really jealous or angry.’ ”\n\nThen separate the children and sit with the one having a difficult time.\n\n“You are co-regulating (emotions) with him. They need the physical comfort, the one-on-one connection,” Edlynn said.\n\nI had my doubts, but I promised I would try her recommendations. It de-escalated the situation much faster than in the past. Usually, a playroom battle would take 20 minutes to handle, but the first time I tried the new techniques, I diffused the situation in less than five minutes.\n\n“A kid’s job is to have feelings,” Kennedy told me. “Because if you want your kid one day when they are an adult to be able to deal with disappointment or jealousy – which we all know adults feel – you want them to have coping skills for those feelings. A kid has to feel the feelings. So their job is to scream, ‘No, I want that toy!’ “\n\nPractice, practice, practice\n\nPractice makes perfect.\n\nKennedy suggested an exercise my husband and I could do separately or together: We’d take one of the children and role-play a scenario such as dinnertime or a dispute over a toy.\n\nMelas and husband Mazza should do some role-playing with their boys, experts suggest. Chloe Melas/CNN\n\n“You’re problem-solving when things are easy,” Kennedy said. “It’s the equivalent of practicing a free throw during practice versus only waiting to practice a free throw when the game is on the line.”\n\n“Ask your 4-year-old, ‘What would it be like if I had the blue block? I have the blue block. What could you do if I have the blue block and you want it? I’m not going to let you hit me or grab me because that’s not safe for anyone so I wonder what you could do?’ “\n\nBoth experts told me that parenting at this age is about creating boundaries for the long term.\n\n“The way we present information to our kids is either building up their own understanding and sense of responsibility and their own internal motivation to do things a certain way,” Edlynn said, “versus the more controlling stance, (which) ends up working in the short term, and then the children aren’t learning.”\n\nIt’s never going to be perfect\n\nEdlynn, who has three kids of her own, ages 12, 10 and 7, said we should all give ourselves a bit of a break, noting that children’s brains are still developing. “We are their coaches for their brains,” she said, noting she is always asking, ‘How can my child learn from this moment?’ ”\n\n“I have a 10-year-old, a 7-year-old and a 4-year-old,” Kennedy said. “I’m the first parent to need to read my own Instagram and take my own advice. I have plenty of stuff that’s hard with my kids, too.\n\n“There is no such thing as a perfect parent,” she said. “We all mess up.”", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/03/28/jackson-ms-multiple-gangs-crime/82420496007/", "title": "Jackson has nearly 30 gangs.

Penzone defeated Arpaio in last year's general election, ending his 24-year span as sheriff.\n\nAt an afternoon press conference Tuesday, Penzone said Tent City has become the preferred location for inmates and a liability for understaffed detention officers. Shuttering the facility will save the county approximately $4.5 million a year, he said.\n\nAnticipating potential criticism about the move, Penzone assured the community there is plenty of room at the county’s other detention facilities\n\n“This facility is not a crime deterrent, it is not cost efficient, and it is not tough on criminals,” he said, adding that the facility had become more of a \"circus\" atmosphere for the general public. \"Starting today, that circus ends, and these tents come down.”\n\nPenzone said the process would not happen overnight. About 50 percent of the Tent City inmates — there are about 800 of them — will be moved to other facilities in the next 45 to 60 days, while those on work furlough may take up to six months.\n\nPart of Arpaio's 'tough on crime' image\n\nAs jail populations dwindled in recent years, Tent City stood largely as a political pawn for its founder. Arpaio, who first was elected in 1992 and remained sheriff until Penzone unseated him, pointed to the facility as a testament to his “tough on crime” image, and last year refused to consider its closing at the expense of detention-officer raises.\n\nTent City was expected to cost about $8.6 million over the current fiscal year, yet recent inmate counts show the facility is all but vacant.\n\nA snapshot from September showed only about 400 of Tent City’s 2,176 beds were occupied by full-time inmates. Another 400 were sleeping at the tents but were on work furlough, meaning they are released into the community for 12 hours a day.\n\nThough he only announced his official decision on Tuesday, Penzone seemed to foreshadow the facility's fate in an interview earlier this year.\n\n“The cost efficiency of the jail has likely diminished” since it was opened, Penzone said, but “it’s going to be a data-driven decision.”\n\nThe committee is chaired by former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, who teased the announcement Tuesday morning on social media.\n\n“After months of study, we are ready to make our recommendations to the Sheriff concerning Tent City,” Woods tweeted.\n\nWoods said earlier that the committee’s goal was to determine whether Tent City served a legitimate public-safety service and whether it was a worthy taxpayer expense.\n\nThe ultimate decision was played close to the vest, with the committee closing its meetings to the public and the media.\n\nAt the press conference, Woods said most of the inmates actually preferred the open space of Tent City to its indoor counterparts, which flies in the face of civil-rights advocates who for years have claimed conditions at the jail facility were unusually harsh.\n\nAlso, Woods noted, a Tent City stint was voluntary. Inmates had the choice to be housed inside.\n\n\"That tells you that the negative image that we’ve gotten since 1993 — that we are so tough on prisoners in Maricopa County — that that was false,\" he said.\n\nWoods noted that this was good and bad news: While the county suffered an undue negative image because of the tents, he was relieved to hear the inmates hadn't been mistreated there.\n\n“Having said that, the days of Arizona being a place — I hope — where people are humiliated or embarrassed or abused or ridiculed for the self-aggrandizement of anybody or anything are over,” he said. “They have no place in our community, they don’t reflect our community, and we’re moving on.”\n\nDecision to close jail unanimous\n\nOther board members hold an assortment of community-service expertise and include Maricopa County NAACP President Dr. Ann Hart, Arizona public-health expert Will Humble, and Lydia Guzman, a civil-rights activist for Latinos and longstanding critic of Arpaio.\n\nThe decision to close Tent City was unanimous among the board members.\n\nTuesday’s recommendation is the most significant departure from Arpaio-era policies since mid-February, when Penzone announced he would no longer honor “courtesy” immigration holds for the federal government in his jails.\n\nArpaio, who became a national celebrity for his hard-line policing strategies against illegal immigration, endured multimillion-dollar court battles to preserve this image. An ongoing racial-profiling lawsuit has now cost the county nearly $56 million.\n\nPenzone framed himself as the anti-Arpaio on the campaign trail. He promised to move away from politically based decisions in favor of public safety and fiscal responsibility.\n\nTent City Jail was erected in 1993, where a 7-acre compound in south Phoenix was stocked with military-surplus tents rather than brick and mortar. The facility only houses sentenced inmates — largely DUI offenders — rather than those held before trial.\n\nThe facility has drawn the ire of civil-rights activists for years. The open-air facility subjects inmates to all of the elements of the Phoenix desert, including the summer’s blistering 110-plus-degree temperatures.\n\nArpaio said he respects Penzone's decision\n\nWhen reached for comment after the press conference, former Sheriff Joe Arpaio said he would respect Penzone's decision.\n\n\"That’s his call, OK? Not mine. I’m not going to second-guess him,\" he said. \"If I was still the sheriff, those tents would never be gone.\"\n\nArpaio said Tent City was a \"great program\" when he started it 24 years ago and claimed that it saved \"millions and millions of dollars.\"\n\n\"George Soros got his wish,\" Arpaio said, referring to the liberal billionaire who funded anti-Arpaio ads during the 2016 campaign. \"When he pumped about $5 million against me to get me out of office, he wanted to close Tent City. So I guess he got his wish.\"\n\nThe timing of Penzone’s announcement coincides with a rally to close Tent City that immigrant-rights groups and labor organizers held outside of Tent City late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nClose to 50 demonstrators showed up at the rally, applauding Penzone's move and urging him to continue making reforms at the county jails.\n\n\"We’re really looking forward to seeing this first step and looking forward to seeing him take many more steps,’’ said Maria Castro, an organizer with Phoenix-based Puente Human Rights Movement, which works with migrant communities in Arizona.\n\n“This is a community victory. This is something we’ve been working hard for for many years.’’\n\nShe called on Penzone to provide adequate meals and needed supplies to inmates, in particular women who are incarcerated at the jails and to remove U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who screen detainees during the booking process in the Fourth Avenue Jail.\n\nThe Tuesday afternoon rally was part of a national demonstration calling for “racial and economic justice” on the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, according to Abril Gallardo, organizer for Living United for Change Arizona.\n\nElva “Paty” Bernal, a 53-year-old Phoenix resident, was held last year for several hours at the Tent City Jail and later transferred to federal immigration officials after she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI conviction from December 2015, she said in an interview with The Arizona Republic.\n\nBernal said the jail was “inhumane” and she’s glad it will be shutting down.\n\n\"The food is expired, the water isn’t drinkable … It was an experience that I wouldn’t wish upon anybody,” Bernal said. “I’m very happy because we are fighting for the well-being of our community, there won’t be any other people who’ll go through what I experienced. We’ll keep raising our voices to get immigration out of jails in Arizona.”\n\nBernal has lived in the U.S. without immigration status for more than 30 years after crossing the border illegally, and her six children were all born in the U.S.\n\nArizona Republic reporter Eric Newman contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/11/22/stars-recycling-fashion-duchess-meghan-angelina-jolie-tiffany-haddish/8668625002/", "title": "Meghan Markle, Angelina Jolie, Kate Middleton: Stars recycling ...", "text": "Celebrities re-wearing outfits we’ve already seen them in perhaps should not be headline-worthy — it’s not like most people are stepping out in brand-new fashion every single day.\n\nBut a recent uptick in stars wearing recognizably recycled looks exemplifies the unique moment style has found itself in after years of fast fashion’s rising popularity and social media’s gnawing, ever-present call for the next best thing.\n\n“We’re experiencing an exciting moment in fashion right now, when suddenly it’s less about what you’re wearing and how it looks on you, and more about the statement your attire makes,” StyleCaster fashion and lifestyle editor Bella Gerard tells USA TODAY.\n\nCelebrity fashion statements these days can say a lot: They can show support for an up-and-coming brand or highlight a sustainable clothing line, Gerard says. They can also tell a compelling story specific to the star in question.\n\nLooking for a free mini puzzle? Play the USA TODAY Quick Cross now.\n\nThe royal standard: Duchess Kate, Duchess Meghan repeat with a purpose\n\nDuchess Kate and Prince William arrived at William's inaugural Earthshot Prize awards ceremony last month, both wearing outfits major royals fans had seen them in before.\n\nKate wore a periwinkle custom Alexander McQueen dress she wore to a BAFTA event in 2011, while William chose a dark turtleneck and a green velvet suit jacket he wore to the 2019 Centrepoint Gala. The occasion was about environmental sustainability, so recycling past looks was a natural fit.\n\n\"It automatically takes the focus off the clothes and puts it on the engagement,\" says fashion journalist Elizabeth Holmes, the author of \"HRH: So Many Thoughts On Royal Style.\" \"(Kate does this) at a time when she wants to minimize the fashion discussion of that moment and focus on the cause or the engagement or whatever work she is there to do. I think she picks her repeats really carefully and I think it's really smart.\"\n\nThe British royal family – particularly the women – have all eyes on their daily fashion choices, from Queen Elizabeth II's matching skirt suits and hats to the fashion blogs that monitor every single outfit Kate and Duchess Meghan step out wearing. Members of the monarchy walk a fine line between looks that are glamorous but also allow fans to relate to them. What's more relatable than choosing something already in their closet?\n\n\"They need to seem fancy and frugal,\" Holmes says. So re-wearing outfits is \"practical, but it also serves a really important purpose in the discussion around them, because everybody is scrutinizing everything Kate and Megan do. So when you see those familiar pieces, it just makes them seem human.\"\n\nPrince William's repeated formalwear is especially notable given the double standard for male and female celebrities. William, Prince Harry or their father, Prince Charles, can re-wear a black or navy suit dozens of times without anyone noticing, but when a woman re-wears something from her wardrobe it’s noteworthy – leaving female stars with a \"burden of presentation,\" as Holmes describes it.\n\n\"If you can repeat that look and get more than one moment of your return on investment, go for it,\" Holmes adds.\n\nWhat we can learn from Tiffany Haddish and her 'gown that keeps on giving'\n\nIf anyone has gotten a return on their investment, it's Tiffany Haddish.\n\nWhen the comedian and actress was still an up-and-comer, she attended the 2017 premiere of her movie \"Girls Trip\" in a white Alexander McQueen gown, but felt she hadn't gotten enough wear out of the more than $4,000 designer dress. So she wore it again. And again.\n\n'The gown that keeps on giving':Tiffany Haddish re-wears her famous McQueen dress again\n\nThus, it followed her to her \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting gig in 2017, the 2018 Oscar Awards, the 2018 MTV Movie and TV Awards, and a 2019 appearance on David Letterman's Netflix show \"My Next Guest\" and the cover of People magazine this year.\n\n\"My whole team, they told me, 'Tiffany, you cannot wear that dress on SNL. It's taboo to wear it twice,' \" Haddish said during her \"SNL\" monologue. \"And I said, 'I don't give a dang about no taboo. I spent a lot of money on this dress. This cost way more than my mortgage.' \"\n\nGerard notes that the comedian recycling her look was \"quite the joke,\" but also spoke to Haddish's \"practical values.\"\n\n\"I think it can be funny. I think it can be extremely powerful. Both things can be true,\" Holmes agrees. \"The way that she spun it was entertaining, but it was also making a real statement. …We talk a lot about how fun it is and … the glamorous side of it. But logistically, it's expensive (and) it's time consuming.\"\n\nAngelina Jolie, Brooke Shields and the intergenerational re-wear\n\nOther stars are inviting their children to be a part of these memorable fashion moments. Angelina Jolie and Brooke Shields have both gone viral for sharing previous red carpet dresses with their daughters for big moments.\n\nLast month, Jolie brought several of her children to various red carpets for her new \"Eternals\" film. At one premiere, daughter Shiloh Jolie-Pitt borrowed a black-and-white Dior gown that her mom initially wore for a \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" press conference in 2019. At another, Zahara Jolie-Pitt wore the same vintage silver Elie Saab Couture gown her mother famously wore to the 2014 Academy Awards.\n\nBrooke Shields also went viral over the summer after her daughter Rowan Henchy attended prom in the red strapless dress Shields wore to the 1998 Golden Globes.\n\n\"Why not use it as a sort of treasure chest when dressing your kids?\" Holmes says. \"If you have the means to have it tailored and cleaned and all the logistical elements … that's such a beautiful thing. Those are special pieces and beautiful pieces and they deserve to see the light of day again.\"\n\nWhat can these moments teach us about the future of sustainable fashion?\n\nThe trend of celebrities wearing something once and the rise of fast fashion go hand in hand, says Holmes. Over the past 10 or 15 years, stars have increasingly borrowed clothes from designers for special events, which allows them to continuously show up to events in new styles.\n\n“It became part of the Hollywood fashion scene where more is more and new is better,” Holmes adds. “And that translated into consumer shopping patterns.”\n\nThe rise of social media has only fueled the “new is better” mentality. In the age of Instagram influencers and Gen Z fashion reigning on TikTok, the trend cycle has been accelerated to a “frightening pace,” Gerard notes – one that is not sustainable for the environment – or our wallets.\n\n“Right now, an increasing obsession with sustainability has shoppers turning to sustainable and eco-friendly brands,” Gerard says. “Unfortunately, buying clothing in excess from these brands is hardly sustainable.”\n\nSustainable fashion is in:Here's how you can tap into ethical fashion practices\n\nBut as much as social media has fueled celebrities’ fast fashion habits, it also proves audiences have a major appetite for talking about repeats, which can trickle down to consumer habits, too.\n\n“Seeing big-time celebrities turn into outfit repeaters could seriously change the way we view our own wardrobes,’” Gerard says.\n\nHolmes adds: \"I want to do a better job of celebrating repeats, because I will totally admit that sometimes I'm (disappointed about) a repeat. (Repeats) can be as exciting. … I think it takes some work on our part to undo and unlearn the fast fashion way of thinking.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/us/r-kelly-federal-trial-chicago-thursday", "title": "R. Kelly victim testifies 20 years later about sexual abuse, including ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story contains language and descriptions that may be upsetting to some readers.\n\nCNN —\n\nTwenty years after she denied to a grand jury that R. Kelly had sex with her as a girl and recorded some of their encounters, the now-grown woman took the stand Thursday to reverse her testimony.\n\nSpeaking in federal court in Chicago under the pseudonym Jane, the 37-year-old only looked at Kelly once during her testimony – when asked to identify him. Kelly kept his gaze lowered to the defense table throughout her time on the stand.\n\nProsecutors showed recordings that Jane testified showed Kelly engaging in sex acts with her. At times, Jane began to cry during her time on the stand.\n\n“How old were you when the sexual acts depicted in those recordings occurred?” asked Assistant US Attorney Jeannice Appenteng.\n\n“14,” testified Jane, who is expected to retake the stand Friday.\n\nShe testified Kelly began engaging in sex acts with her when she was 14 and had sexual intercourse with her starting when she was 15 “hundreds” of times before she turned 18.\n\nJane is one of five minors who prosecutors allege Kelly sexually abused in the late 1990s, making explicit videos with four of them. Kelly faces charges including producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors to engage in criminal sexual activity and obstruction charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHis codefendants include Derrel McDavid, a former business manager and accountant for the singer, who faces child pornography and obstruction charges. Milton “June” Brown, Kelly’s former assistant, faces one count of conspiracy to receive child pornography. McDavid and Brown have pleaded not guilty.\n\nAn attorney for Kelly asked jurors during opening statements Wednesday to scrutinize why Jane is coming forward now and changing her testimony from two decades ago.\n\n“For the last 22 years, she has adamantly denied that it was her in that video. Before there was any criminal investigation, she denied it. She denied it repeatedly to prosecutors, she denied it to social workers to police officers. She denied it under oath to a grand jury,” Jennifer Bonjean said Wednesday.\n\nOn the witness stand Thursday, Jane said she is testifying under immunity because she lied under oath to a 2002 grand jury about her sexual relationship with Kelly and whether she appears in the explicit video recordings with him.\n\n“If I correct my mistakes by telling the truth, I won’t be prosecuted,” Jane said.\n\n“Why were you untruthful?” Appenteng asked Jane at another point.\n\n“Because I was afraid to expose Robert. Because I was afraid of what might happen to my parents,” she said. “I also did not want that person to be me.”\n\nA family connection\n\nAs a young teen, Jane traveled the world with a Christian hip-hop group whose members were cousins of hers. Prosecutors asked her not to name the group in order to protect her identity.\n\n“I was living my dream,” Jane testified.\n\nHer aunt, known professionally as Sparkle, worked with R. Kelly and had a romantic relationship with him. It was Sparkle who introduced Jane to Kelly when Jane was 12 or 13 years old at a gospel concert for her church, she testified. Weeks later, Kelly came to one of her group’s concerts.\n\n“He was telling me how great of a job I did,” Jane testified. “I felt successful. I felt happy.”\n\nShortly after they met, Jane said she began spending more time with Kelly and Sparkle. She would watch Kelly and Sparkle record music and talk about basketball and music with Kelly. Jane testified she was 13 when Sparkle suggested Jane should ask Kelly to play a bigger role in her life.\n\n“She told me that I should ask him to be my godfather.” Sparkle is expected to testify later in the trial.\n\nJane said Kelly “chuckled” and agreed to be her godfather, and within weeks, their relationship became sexual. Kelly would talk to her on the phone and ask, “What color panties are you wearing?” and “about my breasts growing” and that “I need to be wearing bras,” Jane testified.\n\nWhen Kelly became her godfather, Jane testified that her parents felt comfortable letting her stay the night or even the weekend at his home, without her parents or aunt present.\n\n“They would pretty much drop me off and then leave,” Jane testified.\n\nRecordings of sex acts\n\nJane testified that she was 14 years old when Kelly’s sexualized comments became actions. She said Kelly began touching her breasts and vaginal area while touching himself one night when they were at his recording studio. The touching, she testified, quickly turned into oral sex and other sex acts, and she lost her virginity to him when she was 15.\n\nJane spoke softly as Appenteng asked her to describe one act shown in a video.\n\n“On what part of your body did he urinate?” Appenteng asked.\n\n“My vagina,” Jane said, quietly.\n\nBonjean and an attorney for McDavid have repeatedly objected to prosecutors admitting the recordings as evidence. They contested the authenticity of the videos and the chain of custody the videos have been transferred through in the 20 years since they surfaced. Retired Chicago Police Detective Daniel Everett, who investigated one of the tapes in 2002, testified Thursday he did not know where the original VHS tape featuring multiple recordings is.\n\n“I do not know where it is today,” Everett testified.\n\nJane testified that after recordings were made, they were sometimes kept in a gym bag or a wood-paneled room in Kelly’s former home that she called the “log cabin” area. She sometimes saw Brown carrying the bag filled with recordings, she testified.\n\nProsecutors did not play the recordings in court Thursday but warned jurors during opening statements that they will play during the trial portions of the videos that are “difficult to watch.”\n\nLying to authorities\n\nWhen the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services began investigating an allegation Kelly was having a sexual relationship with Jane in April 2000 when she was 15, Jane testified she denied the relationship. She also testified she later denied to Chicago Police investigators she and Kelly had a sexual relationship.\n\nJane testified Thursday she denied having a sexual relationship with Kelly to her parents, but after reports began surfacing in 2002 about the existence of a tape showing the pair engaged in sex acts, she said Kelly, Jane and her parents had a meeting where Kelly admitted to them he was having a sexual relationship with their daughter.\n\nJane and her father received subpoenas to testify before a grand jury in 2002.

Her relatives wail for justice as she tosses strands onto the coffin.\n\nThey were grieving for 36-year-old Javad Heydari, who was fatally shot last week at one of the anti-government protests that have gripped Iran.\n\nImages like these have galvanized women across the world to join Iranian women protesting the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died in hospital on September 16, three days after being pulled off the streets of Tehran by morality police and taken to a “re-education center” for lessons in modesty.\n\nFrom the Middle East, Europe and across the United States, women around the globe have shown solidarity with Iranian women’s plight in rallies and demonstrations. Some have also cut or shaved their hair in public or while being filmed.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These protests are different, says celebrated Iranian author 11:07 - Source: CNN These protests are different, says celebrated Iranian author 11:07\n\nNow in their 12th day, protests have swept through more than 40 Iranian cities, including the capital Tehran. Iranian security forces have been cracking down on protesters, with hundreds arrested and at least 41 killed, according to state media. Some human rights organizations say the death toll is as high as 76. CNN cannot independently verify these figures.\n\nSo, why are women cutting their hair?\n\nFor many Iranian women, cutting off hair – a sign of beauty that is decreed to be hidden in the Islamic Republic – is a poignant form of protest.\n\n“We want to show them that we don’t care about their standards, their definition of beauty or what they think that we should look like,” said 36-year-old Faezeh Afshan, an Iranian chemical engineer living in Bologna, Italy, who was filmed shaving off her hair. “It is to show that we are angry.”\n\nAfshan attributes the practice of cutting off hair to historical cultural practices. “In our literature, cutting the hair is a symbol of mourning, and sometimes a symbol of protesting,” she told CNN. “If we can cut our hair to show that we are angry… we will do it.”\n\nThe practice is cited in Shahnameh, a 1,000-year-old Persian epic and a cultural mainstay in Iran written by Ferdowsi. Made of nearly 60,000 verses, the poem tells the stories of the kings of Persia and is one of the most important works of literature in the Persian language. In more than one instance through the epic work, hair is plucked in an act of mourning.\n\n“Women cutting their hair is an ancient Persian tradition… when the fury is stronger than the power of the oppressor,” tweeted Wales-based writer and translator Shara Atashi. “The moment we have been waiting for has come. Politics fueled by poetry.”\n\nIn the Shahnameh, after the hero Siyavash is killed, his wife Farangis and the girls accompanying her cut their hair to protest injustice, Atashi told CNN.\n\nThe characters portrayed in the poem “are in everyday use as symbols and archetypes,” she said, adding that the poem has helped shape the identities of Iranians, Afghans and Tajiks for 1,000 years.\n\n“But there is haircutting in the poetry of Hafez and Khaqani too, always about mourning and protests against injustice,” she said, referring to other Persian poets.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Women burn their hijabs after woman's death in police custody 02:55 - Source: CNN Women burn their hijabs after woman's death in police custody 02:55\n\nThe practice is also common in other ancient cultures. The Epic of Gilgamesh, a 3,500-year-old poem from ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) covers themes of grief and despair, where cutting or pulling out one’s hair is used to express anguish. The poem is considered to be one of the world’s oldest works of literature and is said to have influenced neighboring cultures.\n\nShima Babaei, an Iranian activist residing in Belgium who said she was arrested by Iran’s notorious morality police in 2018 for publicly removing her hijab as a sign of protest, told CNN that hair cutting had “historical meaning” for Iranians. Women who lose a direct relative would sometimes cut their hair as a sign of mourning and anger, she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13\n\n“For us, Mahsa was our sister,” she said. “And so, in this way, we are protesting.”\n\nCutting hair, said Atashi, “is itself a ceremony of mourning to better expose the depth of suffering at the loss of a loved one.” And in today’s context, she adds, it is a sign of “protest against the killing of our people.”\n\nThe digest\n\nSaudi king names MBS as prime minister\n\nSaudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz has named his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) as the kingdom’s prime minister and another son Prince Khalid as defense minister, according to Saudi state media.\n\nBackground: The crown prince was promoted from defense minister and has been the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia for several years. Khalid previously served as deputy defense minister. MBS said the kingdom has increased its self-sufficiency in military industries to 15% from 2% and plans to reach 50% under the newly appointed defense minister, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. King Salman will still preside over the cabinet meetings he attends, the decree showed.\n\nWhy it matters: MBS has changed Saudi Arabia radically since rising to power in 2017, leading efforts to diversify the economy from its dependence on oil, allowing women to drive and curbing clerics’ powers. His reforms, however, have come with a crackdown on dissent, with activists, royals, women rights’ activists and businessmen jailed.\n\nTurkey summons German envoy after politician likens Erdogan to ‘sewer rat’\n\nTurkey’s foreign ministry summoned the German ambassador to Ankara on Tuesday to protest comments made by a senior German politician who likened President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to a “little sewer rat,” Reuters reported. “We condemn in the strongest terms the insulting statements made by Wolfgang Kubicki, the vice-speaker of the German Federal Parliament, about our president in a speech during the Lower Saxony state election campaign,” Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Tanju Bilgic said in a statement.\n\nBackground: Kubicki confirmed to Reuters that he made the comment during an election campaign rally while trying to draw attention to a rise in the number of illegal migrants moving from Turkey along the so-called Balkan route towards Germany. “A sewer rat is a small, cute, but at the same time clever and crafty creature that also appears in children’s stories,” Kubicki said, citing the popular animated movie “Ratatouille” as an example.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey is a candidate for EU membership but negotiations have long been stalled amid disagreements on a number of issues including Ankara’s human rights record, migration and geopolitics. Insulting the president is a criminal offense in Turkey, where Erdogan and his ruling AK Party have held power for two decades.\n\nAt least 4 Palestinians killed, dozens wounded in one of this year’s deadliest Israeli West Bank raids\n\nAt least four Palestinian men were killed and 50 wounded during an Israeli military raid in Jenin Wednesday morning, Palestinian officials said, making it one of the deadliest Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank this year, which has already seen over 100 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the raid was related to an attack in Tel Aviv in April which left three people dead, and that the suspects Wednesday fought back with explosives and gunfire.\n\nBackground: For months, Israel has been regularly raiding cities in the West Bank, focusing especially on Jenin and Nablus, saying it is targeting militants and their weapons caches before they have the chance to cross into Israel and carry out attacks. The operation, dubbed “Breaking the Wave” by the IDF, was launched after a series of attacks on Israelis. At least 20 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in attacks targeting civilians and soldiers in Israel and the West Bank so far this year.\n\nWhy it matters: This is already the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 35 of those killed have been in Jenin. Israel says most killed were engaging violently with soldiers during military operations, but dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed as well, human rights groups including B’Tselem have said.\n\nAround the region\n\nMuhammed Semih Ugurlu/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHenna, a reddish-brown dye famously used for body art in many parts of the Middle East, may be making its way to joining the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage.\n\nIn the process of being nominated by the UAE and the Arab League, henna has long been part of Middle Eastern, North African and South Asian heritage and identity.\n\nDating back thousands of years, the temporary dye is used to create elaborate designs mainly on one’s hands, often for religious festivals and celebrations.\n\nRepresentatives from 16 Arab countries met this month to discuss the nomination, according to the Abu Dhabi government media office, stressing that henna plays an important role in Arab and Gulf culture and identity.\n\nUNESCO’s list of intangible cultural heritage includes both inherited as well as modern traditions, and is meant to promote practices that contribute to “social cohesion” and encourage a shared sense of identity.\n\nThe list includes practices such as falconry, yoga, and Arabic calligraphy.\n\nBy Nadeen Ebrahim\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Celine Alkhaldi Nadeen Ebrahim", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/01/08/oregon-history-31-women-who-blazed-trails-state/2832209001/", "title": "Oregon history: 31 women who blazed trails in the state", "text": "Editors note: This series was originally published in March of 2007.\n\nAn unknown author once said: \"History is herstory, too.\"\n\nThe Statesman Journal will tell Oregon's herstory by profiling notable women from the state's past.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. A town in Nevada carries her family name.\n\nQuotable: \"I would place all the Indians of Nevada on ships in our harbor, take them to New York and land them there as immigrants, that they might be received with open arms ...\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Wikipedia, \"Native Peoples\"\n\nChloe Clarke Willson\n\nBorn: April 16, 1818, in Connecticut.\n\nDied: July 2, 1874. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves.

She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school.

She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.'

She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected. She later moved to Los Angeles and entered the real estate brokerage business.\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Stanford University's Women's Legal History Web site, Association for African American Historical Research and Preservation\n\nEdith Green\n\nBorn: Jan. 17, 1910, in Trent, S.D.\n\nDied: April 21, 1987, in Portland. She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen. Mark Hatfield called Green \"the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress.\"\n\nNotable: Linfield College annually presents the Edith Green Distinguished Professor award to a faculty member who has demonstrated outstanding performance in teaching and related faculty roles.

Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977. Mary Eyre Elementary is in Southeast Salem.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Salem Online History\n\nFern Hobbs\n\nBorn: May 8, 1883\n\nDied: April 10, 1964\n\nFacts: Hobbs was sent by Gov. Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850.

The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem.

She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort.

Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college. She was admitted to Willamette Law School in 1956, based on her test scores and the personal recommendation of State Supreme Court Justice Earl C. Latourette.

During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself. You are looking at a person who struggled for years to make ends meet. You are looking at a part-time student still working and committed to earning my college degree. And you are looking at a woman who got actively involved because she saw a wrong that needed to be righted. And today you are looking at the governor of the greatest state in the union. Am I proud? You bet I am. Will I make a difference for Oregon?

Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it.
